        "doc_1_text": "TMZ reports Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has finally welcomed her baby girl.  The publication says the 33-year-old delivered a baby girl early Thursday morning around 4 AM EDT at a hospital outside Cleveland. The little girl reportedly doesn't have a name as yet.  Khlo\u00e9's sisters Kourtney, Kim, mother Kris Jenner and Khlo\u00e9's BFF Malika were by her side during the birth. It's is unknown whether Khlo\u00e9's boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, was present for his daughter's arrival amid his recent cheating scandal.  The birth comes four months after the 33-year-old reality star confirmed she was pregnant after months of speculation.    ELLE UK first reported that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star might be pregnant back in September, and since then the family have done their best to drop hints about Khlo\u00e9's pregnancy.  In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in January, the star opened up about her decision to wait until announcing her pregnancy.  'I wanted to have a baby for so long, and it was just the perfect timing in my eyes. God always has this plan, and I just want to do it on my time and when I felt comfortable to do so,' she explained.  In late March, Khlo\u00e9 revealed her baby's name initial would be a 'T', just like her father's, and has been struggling with pregnancy lips for months.  Earlier in the month, the new mum celebrated an early baby shower where she wore a pink shimmering outfit at the extremely OTT pink party.  For the festivities, Khlo\u00e9 decorated the party venue in animal-themed place settings, pink roses hanging from the ceiling, a pink cake, a giant floral elephant, pink balloons and a pink neon light of the words 'Baby Thompson'.  In February, Khlo\u00e9's younger sister Kylie gave birth to her daughter, Stormi Webster, 17 days after sister Kim Kardashian welcomed baby girl, Chicago West, via surrogate.

Some of the the 27-year-old Cleveland Cavaliers player's alleged indiscretions surfaced in several videos purportedly of the basketballer and various women.  The events unfolded shockingly quickly: to start, The Daily Mail published photos and video that purported to show the NBA pro kissing a woman in a New York City rooftop bar, PH-D Lounge, on Saturday before a game in the Big Apple the following Monday. However, with his hood up in the pictures, it is difficult to confirm it is him or see what exactly happened between the two. The person who filmed the video told The Daily Mail that \"he was on the table right next to us with a group of friends and some girl who he was obviously making out with all night.\"  Then, The Shade Room published photos and video of Tristan entering his hotel with a woman. According to the outlet, they entered the hotel together and emerged together with Thompson in a different outfit. The Shade Room reported they later returned together again early the next morning on Sunday and then the woman was seen leaving the hotel later that night with a large tote and without Thompson.",

That is, if they even have one anymore.  To jog your memory, Khlo\u00e9 just gave birth to a baby girl named True and in the same week that happened, rumors of Tristan\u2019s alleged affairs surfaced. Kim and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family had flown out to Cleveland, Ohio to be by Khlo\u00e9\u2019s side when she gave birth, and Kim is graciously sharing what it\u2019s been like ever since.  In a sneak-peek released last week, Kim said it's not going that great for the youngest Kardashian sister.  In Kim\u2019s interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Kim said, \"Like, I don\u2019t even know how to describe it besides it\u2019s just so f*cked up.\" Indeed it is, Kim.  And in the full interview clip, Kim said Khlo\u00e9 is taking some time for herself and True and isn't making any hasty decisions about her and Tristan's relationship.  According to Kim, Khlo\u00e9 is currently alone in Cleveland to have time to bond with her baby and is still on the fence about whether or not she and Tristan will stay together.  \"You know, I think she\u2019s not thinking of anything,\" Kim said. \"I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family\u2019s flown out there a few times.\"  She went on to say, \"I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space].\"  Kim said her whole family is just trying to be supportive of Khlo\u00e9.  \"We really were rooting for Khlo\u00e9, and we still are. She's so strong and she's doing the best that she can. It's a really sad situation all over.\"  The only thing she didn't talk about was if she ever liked Tristan.  When Ellen asked her about her opinion of Tristan, Kim danced around the question and threw some shade toward him.  \"I kind of made this rule with my brother, if there's a baby involved, I'm not going to talk. I'm going to keep it cute and keep it classy and not talk too bad. I'm going to try not to say anything so negative because one day True is going to see this.\"  And there you have it folks, a prime example of if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

The reality star recently took to her app to discuss her \"stealth secrets\" and reveal how she told Thompson about her pregnancy.  \" I can't even believe I hid my bump for as long as I did.\"  Advertisement    The Kardashian family is known being open with fans, but Khloe Kardashian took a different approach during the first six months of her pregnancy. Rather than flaunt the news, she went to great lengths to hide her bump until making a pregnancy announcement via Instagram in December.  The \"Revenge Body\" creator recently took to her app to share some \"stealth secrets\" from her first two trimesters and tips for hiding a baby belly.  \"I can't even believe I hid my bump for as long as I did,\" she wrote. \"It took a few styling sessions, serious strategy and a s---ton of courage, but it worked.\"  Kardashian revealed that she wore billowy coats and held strategically placed accessories, like purses in front of her stomach, when going out in public. She also noted that \"nothing is more distracting than a chic pattern\" and a cinched waist with a flared, A-line hem is perfect for \"hiding a small bulge.\"  Advertisement  \"I went super girly for Kim's baby shower. Little did everyone know I'm expecting, too,\" she wrote. \"[My dress] flows loosely at the exact right spot.\"  \ud83d\udc9c Cherry Blossoms and Tea for baby number three \ud83d\udc9c #KKW A post shared by Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) on Nov 11, 2017 at 7:41pm PST Nov 11, 2017 at 7:41pm PST  The reality star addressed why she kept her pregnancy hidden for so long, saying that the worst part was keeping a \"major secret\" from her family.  \"I'm with my sisters pretty much every single day, so it was hard to not be able to say why I was so sick or couldn't do certain things,\" she wrote. \"[Tristan and I] wanted to tell everybody at one time, which made things even more tricky \u2014 how do you get all those people together in one room?! \u2014 but it was so amazing when we finally did!\"  When it came to the public, however, Kardashian did not think hiding her pregnancy was, \"as big of a deal.\"  Advertisement  \"I believe there are certain things that need to be held private and for yourself,\" she wrote. \"It was beautiful to have something that was just ours.\"  For a family whose life has been filmed for over a decade, it's understandable why Kardashian would want to keep such a personal, intimate experience private for as long as possible. However, now that the \"Strong Looks Better Naked\" author is officially in her third trimester, her bump would probably be difficult to hide.  \u2765 Officially 6 months \u2765 A post shared by Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) on Jan 2, 2018 at 12:31pm PST Jan 2, 2018 at 12:31pm PST  Kardashian's boyfriend, NBA star Tristan Thompson, has been \"reassuring and confident about everything\" throughout the pregnancy, according to a separate post. In fact, Kardashian wrote that Thompson intuitively knew she was pregnant before she even took a test.  \"I actually had to FaceTime him to tell him. I was nervous and he was so excited,\" Kardashian wrote. \"Of course, it's such a blessing and such an exciting thing \u2014 but I do believe your initial reaction is always nerves. I'm so blessed that Tristan has been beyond supportive!\"  Advertisement  Kardashian said having an excited partner to act as a support system is \"crucial,\" praising her boyfriend as an \"angel.\"  \u2765 Mom and Dad \u2765 A post shared by Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) on Jan 2, 2018 at 12:44pm PST Jan 2, 2018 at 12:44pm PST  \"This process is trying \u2014 physically and mentally \u2014 but Tristan has made everything as easy and beautiful as it can be! More than I could have imagined,\" she wrote.  Fans of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" will know that having a baby is a longstanding dream for the future mom, so it's heartwarming to know that she is enjoying both her pregnancy and relationship.

In the midst of the tidal wave of Kardashian pregnancies that came earlier this year, Khlo\u00e9 kept hers a secret for as long as possible in order to make sure that her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, could have her special moment as a new mom. Wow, when would your big sister ever?  2018 got off to a strong start for the Kardashian dynasty, with Kim Kardashian West welcoming her third child, Chicago, back in January. Just one month later, Kylie gave birth to daughter Stormi, having kept her pregnancy (mostly) a secret and deciding not to announce that she was expecting her first child with boyfriend, Travis Scott. Completing the trifecta with a very un-Kardashian-like move, it wasn\u2019t until she was over half way through her own pregnancy that Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian unveiled her baby bump to the world.  Revealing the real reason that she waited so long to announce that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson were to have their first child together, Khlo\u00e9 explained on Keeping Up With The Kardashians that she was only thinking of sister and BFF, Kylie. \"I am really anxious to announce my pregnancy, but Kylie\u2018s three months ahead of me and I want to give her her own time to shine and let her do her thing,\" Khlo\u00e9 said.  A post shared by Khloe\u0301 Kardashian (@khloekardashian) A photo posted by on  \"But Kylie keeps going back and forth on whether she will announce. Waiting is so frustrating because my body is changing and people are super invasive and just not being respectful,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 admitted, before an explanation came towards the end of the episode.  Kylie later told Khlo\u00e9: \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to announce that I'm pregnant. I just don\u2019t want to be in the spotlight, I just want to be low-key. You should go ahead, you don\u2019t have to wait for me, you should announce\u2014it\u2019s exciting for you, too.\u201d    A post shared by Khloe\u0301 Kardashian (@khloekardashian) A photo posted by on  It\u2019s almost sweet enough to make you forget about the times that the Kardashian-Jenners have almost torn each other apart in brutal, vicious, unforgiveable family arguments, isn't it?

THE Kardashian family has revealed who delivered Kylie Jenner\u2019s daughter, Stormi, when she was born \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t the doctor.  In a preview of the latest episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, \u2018momager\u2019 Kris Jenner reveals that she is the one who delivered her daughter\u2019s baby.  Jenner gushed over her 21-year-old, saying she was \u201csuch a trooper\u201d through her delivery.  \u201cShe really was. She was so calm,\u201d the mother of five said of Kylie, who shares Stormi with rapper Travis Scott. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d she said before adding, \u201cI delivered the baby! I delivered her. I pulled her out.\u201d  The famous matriarch also shared that, unlike most about to give birth, Kylie didn\u2019t feel much pain.  Jenner said, \u201cShe just kept saying, \u2018I don\u2019t feel any pain,\u2019 and you\u2019d see the contractions like crazy and she would say, \u2018I\u2019m just not feeling it,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018This is really weird.\u2019\u201d  People magazine first reported Jenner\u2019s pregnancy news back in September 2017, but the young reality star didn\u2019t personally confirm them until after she gave birth.  Kylie shared an Instagram post with fans as well as a 10-minute video of her pregnancy journey on YouTube.  \u201cI knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free and healthy way I knew how,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d  But Kylie isn\u2019t the only sister who has had a unique baby delivery.  Back in 2009, when older sister Kourtney gave birth to her first child with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Mason, the star famously pulled out her own baby during the delivery.  In a 2016 interview with Today Extra, she revealed that it was her then boyfriend Disick who had filmed the birth that was aired on the family\u2019s reality show.  \u201cScott was filming it for our own purposes, like for a home movie,\u201d Kourtney explained. \u201cThe birth of my son was such a beautiful experience that I really wanted to share it with people because it was my child. I remember being so terrified to give birth because you see in movies everyone is screaming and it was so crazy and my experience was amazing. I just felt something in me wanted to share that with people.\u201d  Middle sister Khloe, who recently gave birth to her first child, True, often makes fun of her sister\u2019s epic delivery.  During Kourtney\u2019s second birth to her daughter, Penelope, Khloe joked that her sister just \u201cpulls out her own children.\u201d  Kris Jenner is now a grandmother to nine grandkids.

Kardashian gave birth to her daughter around 4 a.m at a hospital outside Cleveland. Her mother Kris Jenner and sisters Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian also were there. The baby\u2019s name and other details were not reported.  The Cleveland Cavaliers player had also been invited into the delivery room, despite the fact that he reportedly left Kardashian devastated and \u201cballistic\u201d after news broke this week that he had been unfaithful to her with multiple women.  TMZ reported that the 33-year-old reality TV star, in her ninth month of pregnancy, began having contractions Wednesday amid all the turmoil of the cheating allegations.  Kardashian had relocated to Thompson\u2019s hometown of Cleveland to enjoy the final stretch of her pregnancy and to give birth to her baby at an area hospital. When news surfaced about Thompson and his alleged trysts with other women, it was too late in her pregnancy for her to fly back to Los Angeles. Kris Jenner and Kim and Kourtney Kardashian rushed to Cleveland to be by her side.  As for having Thompson with her, sources told TMZ that Khloe Kardashian understood the importance of the birth in the lives of everyone involved and believed that the bond between her daughter and Thompson could be cemented in the delivery room.  \u201cThe Kardashians are furious with Tristan, but despite what happened in New York, Khlo\u00e9 really wanted him there for the birth of their daughter,\u201d a source told Page Six.  Thompson\u2019s presence in the delivery room came hours after he and his team lost to the lowly New York Knicks at Cleveland\u2019s Quicken Loans Arena. Thompson didn\u2019t receive a very warm welcome back at his home arena. TMZ and People both reported that people in the crowd booed when he joined the game late in the first quarter.  Kardashian\u2019s labor started the day after reports began surfacing in various outlets that her NBA boyfriend had cheated on her in October, when she was three months pregnant, and more recently over the weekend, when he was traveling with his team in New York City.  The Daily Mail, TMZ and other outlets on Tuesday published photos and videos of Thompson, 27, making out with a curvy brunette at a club in New York City on Saturday night and then later entering a hotel room with the woman. She was subsequently identified by the Daily Mail and Page Six as an Instagram model and strip club bartender named Lani Blair.  TMZ also published a video of Thompson, shot by a surveillance camera in October 2017, at a Washington D.C. hookah lounge. Thompson is seen in the video making out with two women and allowing the women to grope him.  One of the women in the video told TMZ Wednesday that she had no idea Thompson was in a serious relationship with Khloe Kardashian when she and he had their \u201cfling.\u201d  A report in People magazine on Wednesday quoted an \u201cinsider\u201d as saying that the cheating allegations were \u201ca long time coming.\u201d  \u201cTristan has been consistently cheating on Khlo\u00e9,\u201d the source told People. \u201cHe\u2019s a serial cheater. And there will be more women to come out of the woodwork.\u201d  This is not the turn in her relationship that Khloe Kardashian likely expected, certainly not recently when she posted happy baby bump photos of her in romantic, sexy poses with her baby daddy.  Kardashian and Thompson began dating in September 2016, with the \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d star soon proclaiming that she thought Thompson was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.  In a June 2017 episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d she gushed about how she and Thompson had talked about starting a family together. \u201cHe wants to have five or six kids with me and that\u2019s lovely. We could start at one and grow from there,\u201d Kardashian said.  Kardashian and the rest of her famous family soon become regular fixtures at Cavaliers games. In December 2017, she announced her pregnancy by sharing a snap of her bare baby bump.  But the idea that Thompson would make loyal boyfriend/husband/father material seemed a stretch, given that he broke up with his previous girlfriend, Jordan Craig, while she was pregnant. Craig gave birth to their son, Prince, in December 2016 after he had begun to see Kardashian.  This story is developing.",

Thompson was present at the hospital where Kardashian gave birth, sources told TMZ, despite the fact that she had reportedly left him devastated and \"ballistic\" following news of his infidelity.

In the clip, she addressed the cheating scandal, saying, \"I don't want to take away anything from this moment, and I have always been a believer of 'don't make permanent decisions off temporary emotions.' And you know what? Me and Tristan will deal with him and I at a later time. I want to experience this magical moment, and I want this for me and my daughter, and for him at the end of the day.\"",

In a post to her blog and app on Tuesday, the Good American designer opened up about watching her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, give birth to daughter Stormi, when Khloe was six months pregnant with her own baby.  \"I've been so lucky to be in the labor and delivery room for every one of my sisters' deliveries,\" Khloe wrote, calling Kylie's Feb. 1 delivery the \"most significant\" experience.  \"I was six months pregnant, so it was a lot more real because I knew I'd have to do that in three months,\" she explained. \"You don't miss a beat when you know you have to do it soon!\"  \"But having said that ... I don't think it's smart to watch another person give birth when you're pregnant, LOL,\" Khloe added.  In her blog post on Monday, the 33-year-old reality star -- who is expected to welcome her first child with Tristan Thompson in Cleveland, Ohio, any day now -- insisted that watching her sisters go through labor has removed her fear when it comes time to give birth herself.  \"I've seen over eight births live and in person. Women were made to do this!\u201d Khloe said. \u201cI read my apps every day and I ask my doctor if I have any questions.\u201d  \u201cOf course I'm a little nervous to go into labor, but I'm trying to not overthink something that literally happens all the time,\u201d she expressed.  According to her sister, Kim Kardashian West, however, Khloe is pretty \"freaked out\" about becoming a first-time mom. In a recent interview with ET, Kim said she was the \"real one\" with Khloe about how everything's \"going to go down.\"  \"You cannot tell her anything right now that's too sensitive because she's just so freaked out. So, I can't really get into the whole, like, nipples and breastfeeding thing,\" she quipped. \"She's just going to have to figure that all out and slowly.\"  \"It'll be fine. She knows,\" Kim noted. \"She's seen all of us go through it. She's prepared, but I feel her and I are on a really good communication about everything.

        "doc_1_text": "With so much speculation surrounding the reported birth of Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z's twins, it seems like fans are ready to grasp onto any news surrounding news surrounding their existence or birth \u2014 and I don't blame them. Jimmy Kimmel decided to test this theory, taking to the streets of Los Angeles to have a little fun with innocent Beyonc\u00e9 fans (and give them some fake info about her twins names). But Jimmy Kimmel's fake Beyonc\u00e9 twin names make a very important point \u2014 celebrity obsession has gotten a little out of hand.  Kimmel is known for his \"lie witness news\" segments on his late night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, tricking innocent bystanders on the streets into believing some ridiculous headlines. His segment on Tuesday's night show was no different. Instead of headlines, Kimmel got people to believe that Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z had named their kids some pretty fun names, making them congratulate the couple on the birth of their twins. \"This afternoon, we went out on the street and asked people to congratulate Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z on their recent arrival with some baby names we made up,\" Kimmel told the audience. The results were pretty hilarious and definitely worth watching (and also a little embarrassing).  The full list of names that Kimmel's producers convinced bystanders to say aloud (and congratulate Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z for) are pretty great:  Cucumber & Uvula  Denver & Omelette  Landline & Retweet  Bedbath & Beyondc\u00e9  Pantene & Neosporin  Zumba & Zika  Bong & Blunt  Coco Loco & Hydraulics  Megatron & Gluten  Emphysema & Kevin  Gonorrhea & Amoxicillin  Bebop & Rocksteady  The twins' real rumored names, Rumi and Sir, are no where near as crazy as the names that Kimmel and company came up with but still pretty unique nonetheless. And because Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z haven't actually confirmed the names of the twins, they very well could be named any of Kimmel's combinations (my money is on Bedbath and Beyondc\u00e9).  All jokes aside, Kimmel's segment makes an important point about celebrity obsession. The video proves that fans (and society as a whole) are so happy for celebrities they love that when they give birth, people are willing to pretend to be overjoyed over even the most ridiculous rumors. The fact of the matter is, it has been a little less than a month since it was reported that Beyonc\u00e9 gave birth and she still hasn't even confirmed the fact that she went into labor herself. Maybe we should all consider this a lesson about learning to just chill.  For the past three weeks, fans have been holding on to any bit of information that sounds legitimate \u2014 that the twins were reportedly born prematurely and spent some time \"under the lights\", that they are reportedly a boy and a girl, and that their names are reportedly Rumi and Sir \u2014 and even some rumors that are much less believable, like the one about them paying millions of dollars for a pacifier, for instance.  For all we know, every one of those things could be just as made up as the names \"Zumba and Zika\" \u2014 and yet fans are still choosing to believe this information is real because it's all they can get for the moment.

        "doc_2_text": "As they prepare to welcome a child together in the wake of ongoing cheating allegations, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson\u2018s future together is unclear.  \u201cThis is supposed to be the most joyous time in her life and it\u2019s been ruined and that\u2019s probably what hurts most of all,\u201d a family source tells PEOPLE about Kardashian, 33, who is due with her first child \u2014 a daughter \u2014 with Thompson, 27, any day now.  On Tuesday, photos and videos surfaced of the NBA player allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at an N.Y.C. lounge over the weekend. TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.  Tristan Thompson and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. Khloe Kardashian/Instagram  Despite the allegations of infidelity \u2014 a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is \u201ca serial cheater\u201d \u2014 the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.  \u201cShe\u2019s a hopeless romantic and she\u2019ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She\u2019s having a child with Tristan, and she\u2019s going to try to rebuild this,\u201d the source says.  Adds the source: \u201cKhlo\u00e9 could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That\u2019s actually even worse.\u201d  Prior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 \u2014 one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) \u2014 but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player\u2019s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom  \u201cKhlo\u00e9 spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That\u2019s not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It\u2019s just not. And Khlo\u00e9 can\u2019t lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,\u201d the source says.  RELATED VIDEO: Did Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?  \u201cThe thing about Khlo\u00e9, though, is she\u2019s a big believer in knowing someone\u2019s back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he\u2019d been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She\u2019s got a big heart \u2014 too big sometimes,\u201d the source shares.  Thompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson\u2019s first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.

She might still believe that, honestly.\u201d  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  With the baby\u2019s arrival imminent, Kardashian has been nesting in Cleveland with the NBA player. A source previously told PEOPLE she planned on giving birth there, and her famous family would fly in, including mother Kris Jenner, who is already in Ohio with Kardashian.  While her future with Thompson remains unknown, the Good American jeans founder is focusing her attention on her unborn daughter.  \u201cThe only thing Khloe can do now is focus on her baby,\u201d the source says.\u201dWhat\u2019s happened over the last 24 hours changes a lot of things, but it doesn\u2019t change everything: It doesn\u2019t change that Khlo\u00e9 has dreamed of becoming a mom, already loves her baby so much, and that soon her dream is going to come true.\u201d  \u201cShe can\u2019t wait to meet her little girl, can\u2019t wait to hold her,\u201d says the insider, adding, \u201cand so for right now, the focus is just on getting to that day as safely and healthily as possible.\u201d",

Taking to Instagram overnight to comment on Khloe\u2019s gushing Instagram snap that revealed the worst-kept secret in the world, her babydaddy and boyfriend Tristan Thompson reminisced about how he met the mogul in August last year, giving a sweet shout out to the man behind the madness.  Basketballer Brandon Jennings is the one we (and, we guess Khloe and Tristan, too) have to thank for this merry union, after he introduced 33-year-old Khloe\u2019s to 26-year-old Tristan at Bel-Air hotel just over a year ago.  Tristan, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers said: \u2018My love, Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your journey and entering your life that day at the bel air hotel. One of the best moments in my life.  Peak mayhem as Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson announce pregnancy  (Photo: BACKGRID)  \u2018I\u2019m soo happy to be on this journey together with you and creating this angel from the man above. Everyday I give thanks to him for bring[ing] us together.  \u2018I love you soo much and I know our little angel feels the love we share together and will know that mommy and daddy loves them unconditional forever and ever amen.  He added: \u2018BTW, shoutout the brodie @brandonjennings for bringing this King and Queen together. Love my G.\u201d  Who is Brandon Jennings?  Who set them up? This guy *points to this guy* (Photo by G Fiume/Getty Images)  He\u2019s a 28-year-old pro who played for the New York Knicks in their 2016-17 season.  Tristan once said of the role Brandon played introducing them in August last year that, it was \u2018one of the best lobs (he) has ever thrown in his career.\u2019  Khloe has already spoken about how she met Tristan, telling Ryan Seacrest about the moment it all came together.  She said: \u2018Brandon Jennings, who is a basketball player, he is a friend of mine and Malika [Haqq]\u2019s, and he was like, \u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl, I want to introduce you to someone\u201d,\u2019.  She added: \u2018I was at the Bel-Air hotel. [Tristan] came to the dinner because I didn\u2019t want to go on a blind date, so Brandon kind of ambushed the blind date.  \u2018So, I had a bunch of people and he brought him and we just connected.\u2019  Now look where we are\u2026  Late last night UK time Khloe broke the news she was expecting a baby with her boyfriend of a year, Tristan.  In a length Instagram post, accompanied by a glistening bump pic, she said: \u2018My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can\u2019t believe that our love created life!  \u2018Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned!\u2019  The post has been liked more than 6.7 million times in 12 hours, so we reckon it\u2019ll give Beyonce\u2019s February pregnancy announcement shot a run for its money as most-liked post of 2017.

E! News learned on Thursday she gave birth to their daughter. The news comes amid an alleged cheating scandal involving Tristan. The two have not commented.  Khloe's mother Kris Jenner has helped her a lot with her nursery, flying to Cleveland to lend a hand in person and also shipping decor and other baby products to the house, E! News has learned.  In early March, the two spent two hours shopping for baby gear, toys, furniture and clothes at Petit Tresor and Couture Kids in Los Angeles. Khloe picked out items in pink and neutral colors. Kris made many suggestions and Khloe agreed with many of them, a source told E! News. Kris paid for everything and was happy to treat Khloe, who thanked her several times, the source said.  \"Kris and Khloe were having a blast inside Petit Tresor together,\" another insider told E!

Two of the baby\u2019s new outfits had the words \u201cI love mom\u201d and \u201cI love dad\u201d written on them.  The Good American cofounder revealed the sex of her baby during the season 14 finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashians on Sunday, March 4. Khlo\u00e9, 33, was in San Francisco with big sisters Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, when Kylie Jenner called to deliver the news about the baby\u2019s gender on behalf of her sister\u2019s doctor.  \u201cYou\u2019re having a girl!\u201d the Life of Kylie star, 20, revealed over the phone.

Her family, including mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian, were said to be jetting to Cleveland to be by her side Wednesday.  Sources have told TMZ that the contractions had just started, and it may just be a coincidence that they began the day after multiple outlets reported that Thompson had been photographed spending time in the company of multiple women over the past few months.  The 33-year-old reality TV star is in her ninth month of pregnancy and various news reports have said the baby, her first, could come \u201cany day now.\u201d  The \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d star has been living in Cleveland, the hometown of her 27-year-old boyfriend, a player with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Khloe was planning to give birth in Cleveland, not her hometown of Los Angeles, and had been enjoying a final \u201cpeaceful\u201d stretch of her pregnancy.  But photos and videos surfaced Tuesday showing her pro athlete boyfriend engaged in PDA with a curvy brunette at a New York City club Saturday night. Other images also surfaced, showing Thompson and the brunette, leaving and entering a Four Seasons hotel.  A woman claiming she had spent the night with Thompson in New York City also posted, then quickly deleted a sex tape, along with a number of raunchy messages she said she exchanged with the NBA star, TMZ reported earlier. The woman also claimed she was pregnant, the Daily Mirror added. But TMZ subsequently reported that the woman had no connection to Thompson and that she was just trolling him and Kardashian.  But as if all that weren\u2019t bad enough, TMZ also revealed that Thompson was captured on a surveillance video at a Washington, D.C., hookah lounge in October 2017, kissing and letting himself be groped by at least two women. Kardashian would have been around three months pregnant at the time, TMZ said.  Page Six quoted a Kardashian family source as saying that Khloe was \u201cdevastated when she saw the pictures of Tristan with that girl.\u201d The source said Kardashian went \u201cabsolutely ballistic at him.\u201d  Thompson should be back in Cleveland Wednesday, as the Cavaliers have a home game Wednesday night, TMZ said. He had been in New York City over the weekend after the Cavaliers played in Philadelphia Friday night and played the Knicks in New York on Monday.  The source added to Page Six that a \u201churt\u201d and \u201chumiliated\u201d Khloe was worried for the well-being of her baby.  \u201cHow could he do this, and so publicly, when their baby daughter could arrive within a week?\u201d the source asked.  Khloe Kardashian and her family have yet to say anything about the Thomson cheating allegations. But the source told Page Six that the family wasn\u2019t completely surprised to learn that Thompson might not have been entirely loyal.  After all, Thompson broke up with his pregnant girlfriend Jordan Craig in 2016, possibly to date Khloe Kardashian. His son with Craig was born after he started dating Khloe.  \u201cThe truth is that he has a bad reputation, they had warned Khlo\u00e9 about him, he\u2019s done this before,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t want to hear it, she loves him.\u201d  The story is developing.",

However, recent reports suggest that Thompson may have cheated on Kardashian multiple times, including during a wild weekend in New York City and on other occasions.\n\nThe news comes after a woman claimed that she had spent the night with Thompson in New York City and posted a sex tape and raunchy messages with him. However, sources close to Thompson claimed that the woman had no connection to him and was just trolling him and Kardashian. Thompson was also reportedly caught on surveillance video at a hookah lounge in Washington, D.C. in October 2017, kissing and letting himself be groped by at least two women.\n\nKardashian's family, including Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian, are reportedly jetting to Cleveland to be by her side as she prepares to give birth. Kardashian has yet to comment on the allegations against Thompson, but a source close to her family told Page Six that she is \"devastated\" and \"humiliated\" by the news. \"How could he do this, and so publicly, when their baby daughter could arrive within a week?\" the source asked.\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Thompson have yet to reveal the sex of their baby, but Kardashian recently shared a photo of some adorable bright onesies on her Instagram Story. Two of the baby's new outfits had the words \"I love mom\" and \"I love dad\" written on them. Kardashian revealed the sex of her baby during the season 14 finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashians on March 4.",

The sisters, who usually dress in coordinated outfits, looked like a far cry from their usual uniform as Kim and Kourtney flaunted their flat tummies too.  Khloe has so far refused to confirm or deny whether the reports of her pregnancy are true.  Kim and Khloe enjoying the sun (Picture: Backgrid)  Appearing at an event last weekend, Khloe commented on her curvier size and added according to People: \u2018When I was bigger and wore bigger clothes, I looked even bigger.

Sheeran and McDaid are close friends and later moved to Los Angeles together to continue working on Sheeran's second record.[7] In November 2013, Sheeran posted a picture of himself and McDaid on Instagram stating that they had been making the record together for two years and that it was now complete.[8] Sheeran's X album was released in June 2014 with McDaid having co-written seven of the songs, including \"Photograph\", which went on to go platinum and win a BMI Pop Award, and hit song \"Bloodstream\", which was nominated for Best Song Musically and Lyrically at the 2016 Ivor Novello Awards. The album was nominated for Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards, McDaid's first Grammy nomination. While the album did not go on to win the Grammy, it did go on to with the 2015 BRIT Award for Album of the Year.  While spending much of 2016 working with Ed Sheeran on his third studio album, Johnny also co-wrote \"Love My Life\" with Robbie Williams & Gary Go from Robbie Williams \"The Heavy Entertainment Show\" album.[9] The first two singles from Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 album came out in January 2017 and included, Johnny's co-written \"Shape of You\" which has since become the most streamed song of all time with over 3 billion streams.[10] Johnny produced 3 tracks and co-wrote 8 on the album.[11] \"Shape of You\" went on to win BMI Pop Song of the Year as well as the Ivor Novello award for Most Performed Work.[12][13]  In 2017 Johnny co-wrote Faith Hill & Tim McGraw's single \"The Rest Of Our Life\",[14] Anderson East's single \"All On My Mind\",[15] and Jamie Lawson's \"Can't See Straight\".[16] Additionally, he co-wrote P!nk's single \"What About Us\" from her album Beautiful Trauma.[17] The single, co-written with P!nk and Steve Mac, was received with rave views and debuted at No1 in 26 Markets globally. DJ Snake released his single \"A Different Way\" featuring Lauv, which was the third Ed Sheeran, Steve Mac, Johnny McDaid collaboration to be released.[18] In November 2017, Johnny became an Honorary Fellow of The Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool.[19]  Released in 2018, Johnny co-wrote and produced Keith Urban's single \"Parallel Line\" [20] and co-wrote Shawn Mendes \"Fallin' All In You\" from his self-titled and third studio album.[21] In 2018, Snow Patrol released their 7th studio album titled Wildness.[22] The album debuted as #2 on the UK album charts.[23] He also won the IMRO Outstanding Achievement Award with which he was presented in February 2018.[24]  In 2019, Johnny McDaid co-wrote \"Broken & Beautiful\" by Kelly Clarkson, which was featured in the movie UglyDolls.[25] Johnny also co-wrote and produced Alicia Keys \"Underdog\" and \"Authors Of Forever\" from her seventh studio album 'ALICIA'.[26]  Johnny spent the majority of 2020 and 2021 working with Ed Sheeran on his = album on which he ended up as a producer on 9 songs, a co-writer on 10, including the UK #1 singles \"Bad Habits\" (nominated for Song of the Year at the 2022 Grammys) and \"Shivers\". The album was executive produced by Ed Sheeran, FRED, and Johnny.[27]  Personal life [ edit ]  McDaid began dating actress Courteney Cox in late 2013.[28] The couple announced their engagement on 26 June 2014.[29] In 2019, Cox announced that the couple broke off their engagement but are still in a relationship.  McDaid lives in London and divides his time between the UK and the US, where Cox lives.[30]  McDaid has a tattoo on his left arm reading Nuair is g\u00e1 dom filleadh abhaile, is t\u00fa mo r\u00e9alt eolais (\"When I need to get home you're my guiding light\"), an Irish translation of the song \"Guiding Light\" by fellow Northern Irish musician Foy Vance. Ed Sheeran and Vance both have the same tattoo, as does McDaid's younger sister Maev. The song was written for McDaid's late father, John McDaid Sr., who died in July 2011. \"Guiding Light\" was recorded with Sheeran featured on vocals, and Vance on vocals and piano.[31][32]  Songwriting and production credits [ edit ]  References [ edit ]  Sources [ edit ]",

The most wins in one ceremony by a male artist are held by Drake, and the most wins by a group are held by BTS.\n\nPerformances at the Billboard Music Awards have been broadcast on the Fox network since its inception, but the awards were cancelled for 2007. Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011. The ceremony has since been moved to ABC and NBC.\n\nThe 2020 ceremony, originally scheduled for April 29, was postponed indefinitely on March 17 due to coronavirus-related public assembly concerns. It was rescheduled to October 14.",

After more than twenty years in Nashville, the awards ceremony is now held Austin, Texas, and is broadcast live on CBS, along with CMT (Country Music Television) and other Paramount Global networks. Voting takes place on CMT's website, CMT.com.  History [ edit ]  Beginning in 1967, the Music City News Awards were presented yearly by the now-defunct Music City News magazine. In 1988, The Nashville Network (TNN) began a fan-voted awards show dubbed the Viewers' Choice Awards to help the network celebrate its fifth anniversary. In 1990, the two awards shows merged to become the TNN/Music City News Country Awards.  The TNN contract with Music City News ended in 1999, and the magazine ceased publication shortly thereafter. Country Weekly became the presenting sponsor of the awards show in 2000, and the show was known as Country Weekly presents the TNN Music Awards. In 2001, as TNN began to phase out its association with country music, the decision was made to shift the awards show to sister network CMT. The 2001 show was simulcast on both networks and was called the TNN/CMT Country Weekly Music Awards. When the show moved permanently to CMT, Country Weekly ended its brief association with the production. During this era, viewers voted for the nominees by telephone or mail in traditional categories such as \"Entertainer of the Year,\" \"Male/Female Artist of the Year,\" \"Song of the Year,\" etc. Most of the categories mirrored those on the CMA Awards and ACM Awards, except all awards were fan-voted[citation needed].  The awards show was completely retooled in 2002 to become the CMT Flameworthy Video Music Awards, named for the network's branding concept at the time for its most popular videos. The \"Flameworthy\" name was coined by program development vice president Kaye Zusmann, and aimed to symbolize the waving of lighters or similar lights at concerts (this was before the current negative meaning of the word flaming from the Internet became more commonplace). The show became more production-based, rather than awards-based, and was modeled after sister network MTV's Video Music Awards. In the process, the traditional awards were shifted to specifically honor the music videos of country artists.[1]  The show included several non-traditional categories highlighting especially funny, sexy, and patriotic videos; however, these categories were phased out over the years.[2] The show further differentiated itself from the CMA Awards and ACM Awards by showcasing bluegrass performers such as Alison Krauss and Earl Scruggs.[1]  In 2003, the show was moved to April but returned to June in 2009 to coincide with the CMA Music Festival (the renamed \"Fan Fair\") and the influx of tourists to Nashville as well as capitalize on a time when many of the artists would already be in Nashville at once.  The name of the show was changed to CMT Music Awards in 2005, although the format remained largely the same as in previous years.[3]  In 2020, the awards were delayed until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with that year's CMA Fest not going forward. Initially planned for October 14, a scheduling conflict with that year's Billboard Music Awards caused the ceremony to be pushed back to October 21.  On June 28, 2021, ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global) announced that the awards would move to broadcast television on sister network CBS and shift back to April beginning in 2022. [4][5] The ceremony's new scheduling would jettison the Academy of County Music Awards, which also had been typically held in April and historically broadcast by CBS; the network subsequently declined to renew its contract to air the ACM Awards, citing declining viewership in comparison to increased rights fees demanded by Dick Clark Productions.[6][7][8]  In 2023, after more than twenty years in Nashville, the CMT Music Awards were hosted for the first time at the Moody Center in Austin, Texas.[9][10][11]  Major awards [ edit ]  Winning records [ edit ]  Carrie Underwood is the most awarded artist overall in CMT Music Awards' history (2005\u2013present), with 25 wins.[12]  By category [ edit ]  Video of the Year: Carrie Underwood; ten wins [13]  Male Video of the Year: Kenny Chesney; five wins [14]  Female Video of the Year: Carrie Underwood; eight wins [13]  Collaborative Video of the Year: Carrie Underwood; four wins  CMT Performance of the Year: Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean (tie); two wins each[13]  CMT Artists of the Year [ edit ]  2010: Jason Aldean, Lady A, Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Zac Brown Band  2011: Jason Aldean, Kenny Chesney, Brad Paisley, Lady A, Taylor Swift  2012: Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Eric Church, Toby Keith, Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood  2013: Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Hunter Hayes, Tim McGraw  2014: Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Miranda Lambert, Keith Urban  2015: Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Sam Hunt, Little Big Town, Blake Shelton  2016: Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Chris Stapleton, Carrie Underwood  2017: Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton, Keith Urban  2018: Kelsea Ballerini, Karen Fairchild, Miranda Lambert, Maren Morris, Kimberly Schlapman, Hillary Scott, Carrie Underwood  2019: Kane Brown, Luke Combs, Dan + Shay, Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood  2020: Cancelled Due To COVID-19 Pandemic (Kelsea Ballerini, Brothers Osborne, Florida Georgia Line, Miranda Lambert, Lady A, Little Big Town, Thomas Rhett)  2021: Kelsea Ballerini, Gabby Barrett, Kane Brown, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton  2022: Kane Brown, Luke Combs, Walker Hayes, Cody Johnson, Carly Pearce, Lainey Wilson",

In the new article, released on Thursday, the author writes , \u201cWhen I ask Lambert if she thinks that at this moment in history \u2014 with, among other things, this particular president in office \u2014 there is an opening for her to make the kind of issue-oriented songs [Loretta] Lynn became known for, Lambert is quick to dismiss the idea.\u201d  She is quoted as saying in response, \u201cI am a 100 percent believer in not ever using the platform that I\u2019ve built for anything other than music, because music to me is an escape from your own reality. I don\u2019t want to go to a show and hear somebody preach about their opinions.\u201d And when pushed, Lambert stood her ground.  \u201cIt\u2019s so divided [in politics], you can\u2019t win anyway.

As Gossip Cop reported in February, Reba McEntire argued on \u201cThe View\u201d that entertainers shouldn\u2019t talk politics. Elsewhere in the Billboard story, Lambert also discusses her decision not to do press for her last album, The Weight Of These Wings, to avoid discussing her divorce from Blake Shelton. \u201cI just didn\u2019t need to talk about the record,\u201d she told the magazine.  Lambert continues, \u201cIf you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what happened, it\u2019s all on there. There\u2019s no mystery anymore \u2014 take from it what you will.\u201d She also revealed she co-wrote \u201cVice\u201d the very day the split went public in 2015. \u201cI walked in with guns blazing,\u201d she shared. \u201cI just knew one thing: I didn\u2019t want a breakup record.\u201d",

        "doc_1_text": "'Call Me By Your Name' And 'Get Out' Lead 2018 Independent Spirit Awards Nominees  It's the end of November, and you know what that means: it's time to embark on another awards season. The 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awards nominees have been announced, honoring achievements in the realm of independent movies. These awards are a stepping stone toward the Oscars for films like Get Out and Call Me By Your Name, which earned more nominations than any other films this year. But there's plenty of love for Good Time, Lady Bird, and others as well. Check out the full list of nominees below, and find out what was snubbed along the way.  Luca Guadagnino's sumptuous Italian romance Call Me By Your Name leads the pack with six nominations in categories like Best Feature, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Male Lead (Timothee Chalamet) and Best Supporting Male (Armie Hammer).  Elsewhere, Jordan Peele's Get Out and the Safdie Brothers' Good Time tied for the second highest number of nominations with five each, Lady Bird and The Rider earned four each, and I, Tonya, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and Columbus pulled in three nods apiece.  You can read the full list below, but for me, some of the biggest snubs center around The Big Sick. The movie earned two nominations \u2013 one for Best First Screenplay for co-writers Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, and one for Best Supporting Female for Holly Hunter \u2013 but if I were in charge, Nanjiani and co-star Zoe Kazan would have been nominated for their performances and Michael Showalter might have even gotten a shout-out for directing.  Another big snub: Greta Gerwig didn't get nominated for Best Director for Lady Bird, a film that's connecting with audiences in a major way right now and could very well end up as an Oscar contender in multiple categories. There's no love for I Don't Feel At Home in This World Anymore, a movie that easily could have been recognized for its screenplay, directing, and terrific lead performance by Melanie Lynskey. I haven't seen Raw, The Girl With All The Gifts, or Brigsby Bear yet, but I've heard those are great and I'm a little surprised not to see them pop up in any capacity here.

Eva didn't walk the red carpet, but did show that she was in attendance with her social media, which she captioned with a simple heart.

'What people don\u2019t know about me is that I love being home,' said the mother to Esmeralda, aged two, and Amanda, 11 months.  'Instead of hitting the red carpet, I\u2019d rather be with our girls.'  Homebody: The star recently opened up about why she'd rather skip the red carpet, saying that she'd prefer to spend the night in with her daughters than go out  Inside the magazine, the star looked remarkably slimmed down just one year after welcoming her second child.  The dedicated pair met and fell in love while costarring in The Place Beyond The Pines together in 2011.  Night out: Eva skipped Oscar night with Ryan, who can be seen here with his La La Land co-star Emma Stone",

        "doc_1_text": "The Film Independent Spirit Awards have unveiled this year\u2019s list of nominees, honoring the year\u2019s best in independent film and propelling films like Eighth Grade, First Reformed, and If Beale Street Could Talk further into the Oscar conversation.  The Spirit Awards, held in a tent at a Santa Monica beach on Feb. 23, the day before the Oscars ceremony, honor the best achievements in films made within a $20 million budget. The awards, voted for by members of Film Independent, often help to indicate which films will go on to win key Oscars; Moonlight in 2017, Spotlight in 2016, Birdman in 2015 and 12 Years A Slave in 2014 all won best feature at the Spirit Awards and went on to pick up the Best Picture Oscar.  Bo Burnham\u2019s Eighth Grade, Paul Schrader\u2019s First Reformed, and Lynne Ramsey\u2019s You Were Never Really Here all earned four nominations, including best feature. Barry Jenkins\u2019 If Beale Street Could Talk and Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace rounded out the Best Feature category (and scored three nominations apiece).  Jeremiah Zagar\u2019s We the Animals scored the most nominations with five, including best first feature, best supporting actor for Ra\u00fal Castillo, and the Someone to Watch Award.  The Indie Spirits aren\u2019t a perfect predictor for what will eventually triumph at the Oscars, but they are a decent indicator of what will be in the conversation. (Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s Roma, for example, has been hailed as an early Oscars frontrunner, and it was only eligible at the Spirit Awards in the international film category.)  The winners will be announced Feb. 23 in an awards ceremony broadcast live on IFC. See the full list of nominees below.

        "doc_2_text": "Michael Strahan's abrupt exit from Live! With Kelly and Michael certainly won't improve his relationship with co-host Kelly Ripa.  While the 44-year-old former NFL pro thanked Ripa, 45, during Wednesday's show -- an episode from which Ripa was absent after feeling \"blindsided\" by Strahan's announcement -- sources told ET it wasn't all love between the morning show hosts.  \"Michael and Kelly have not been getting along recently,\" one source said. \"They got along great in the beginning, but not so much lately.\"    EXCLUSIVE: Michael Strahan Calls Dramatic 'Live!' Taping a 'Hard Day' for Everyone  It's not the first time and it won't be the last that co-stars haven't gotten along on set. Here are eight other examples of stars who were beefing behind the scenes.    1. Nathan Fillion & Stana Katic    ABC    Castle fans and co-stars alike were shocked when word broke that Katic would not be returning for the ABC drama's ninth season. Though Fillion said she would be missed, a source tells ET the stars wouldn\u2019t even speak to each other on set. It got so bad that the two were reportedly sent to \"couples therapy.\"  2. Charlize Theron & Tom Hardy (and Charlize Theron & Tobey Maguire)  Warner Bros. Pictures  The Mad Max: Fury Road actress told Esquire she and Hardy \"f**kin' went at it...We drove each other crazy\" and later said, \"From what I hear, he's not like that on every movie -- I hear he's had good experiences.\" Meanwhile, Theron also said she had a \"rough time\" with Maguire while filming Cider House Rules, telling V magazine, \"We're good now. It was a difficult movie...\"    3. Cheryl Burke & Ian Ziering    ABC  The Dancing With the Stars pro revealed on the Allegedly podcast that Ziering was her \"least favorite\" partner and, when asked if it made her want to leave the show, she said, \"No, but it made me want to slit my wrists.\" Burke later said her reference to suicide were \"out of line.\" She added, \"I've always lived by the rule that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all...Regrettably, I broke that rule.\"    EXCLUSIVE: Tyler Perry Shoots Down Oprah Winfrey Feud Rumors: 'It's Completely False'    4. Ryan Gosling & Rachel McAdams    New Line Cinema  Filming The Notebook wasn't all, \"If you're a bird, I'm a bird.\" Gosling reportedly called McAdams -- who he would later go on to date -- \"difficult to work with\" and \"uncooperative\" and director Nick Cassavetes said the actor even tried to get McAdams kicked off the film. \"They were really not getting along one day on set. Really not,\" he said.    5. Mariah Carey & Nicki Minaj    FOX  Both divas joined the American Idol judging panel in 2013 and things quickly escalated on camera and off.

Their mother is of Dutch, English, and Scottish ancestry,while their father was a third-generation Armenian American.After their parents divorced in 1991, Houghton remarried to the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner Bruce Jenner in 1991. Through their marriage, Kardashian gained step-brothers Burton \"Burt\", Brandon, and Brody; step-sister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner  Born: October 21, 1980 (age 33), Los Angeles, California, United States  Siblings: Khlo Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Rob Kardashian, Brody Jenner, Brandon Jenner  Spouse: Kanye West (m. 2014), Kris Humphries (m. 2011\u20132013), Damon Thomas (m. 2000\u20132004)  Parents: Robert Kardashian, Kris Jenner  Children: North West  2007\u201309: Career beginnings  Kardashian attending the Tribeca Film Festival, April 2009    In October 2007, Kardashian, in addition to her mother Kris; her step-father Bruce; her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned by E! to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.The series proved successful for E!, and has led to the creations of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Kim Take Miami.That December, Kardashian posed for a nude pictorial for Playboy.  2010: International success  Kardashian backstage at The Heart Truth's Red Dress Collection, February 2010  2010 saw Kardashian venture into several new endorsement deals, including endorsing various food products for Carl's Jr.Beginning in early 2010, Kardashian and her sisters designed and developed clothing lines for Bebe stores and 'Virgins, Saints, and Angels'. In January 2010, she starred as Summa Eve in the film Deep in the Valley.In April, Kardashian sparked controversy over the way she held a kitten for a photograph, holding it by the scruff of its neck.  2011: Marriage to Kris Humphries  Kardashian in Sydney in November 2011    Kardashian, who has supported recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, encouraged President Obama and the US government to consider its acknowledgement. On April 21, 2011, days before the 96th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Kardashian wrote about the issue on her blog and sent a tweet to her fans, urging its recognition.That April, she also released her third fragrance \"Gold\".    In May, she became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.They were married during an extravagant wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[58] Earlier that month, she had released her \"wedding fragrance\" called \"Kim Kardashian Love\" which coincided with her own wedding.A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a \"media blitz\" related to the wedding. Also in October, Kardashian and her sisters opened their Kardashian Khaos store in Las Vegas.    After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences. After filing, Kardashian asked the court to order Humphries to pay his own legal expenses.On December 1, Humphries filed his response to Kardashian's petition, requesting an annulment on the grounds of fraud or if the court would not grant an annulment, a decree of legal separation rather than Kardashian's requested divorce.Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.Her former publicist Jonathan Jaxson also claimed that her short-lived wedding was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue.A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.  2012\u2013present: Motherhood and marriage to Kanye West    In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled \"True Reflection\", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote. That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse. The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim\u2019s manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states\u2019 consumer protection laws. In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.  Kardashian in Australia for the E! News: Red carpet and dinner in 2012    Kardashian also began dating American rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April, though she remained legally married to Humphries. In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, \"Glam\", which \"draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle\", and was made available through Debenhams.In November, Kardashian and her sisters internationally launched the 'Kardashian Collection' in England,as well as launching a line of cosmetics, 'Khroma Beauty'.On December 31, 2012, Kardashian and West announced that she was pregnant with the couple's first child,a girl.    In February 2013, a judge ruled that Kardashian's divorce case with Humphries would go to trial, and set a trial date for May.However, on April 19, 2013, 536 days after Kardashian's initial divorce filing, she and Humphries reached an undisclosed divorce settlement, avoiding a trial. The divorce was legally finalized on June 3, 2013.",

Rob, 30, and his sister Kylie Jenner, 20, have filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the States of California against 29-year-old Chyna, real name Angela Renee White.  In the lawsuit, which has been seen by Metro.co.uk and was first reported by The Blast, Rob alleges that Chyna \u2018physically abused Rob and engaged in reckless behaviour such as heavy drinking and drug use\u2019.  And in a bombshell claim, Rob alleges that Chyna fell pregnant with daughter Dream to \u2018shake down\u2019 the Kardashians.  A section of the lawsuit reads: \u2018Rob and Kylie [Jenner] are compelled to seek legal recourse against Chyna for enduring several months of injuries in Chyna\u2019s deliberate attempt to extort the Kardashian family for her own monetary gains.  \u2018Chyna\u2019s desire to pursue a relationship and have a baby with Rob was nothing short of an outright fraud to shake down the Kardashian family without any concern of the consequences.\u2019  Dream was born to the couple in November 2016.  Elsewhere in the lawsuit, Rob accuses his ex of a series of alleged assaults, claiming that Chyna physically assaulted him while \u2018intoxicated on drugs and alcohol\u2019 in  December 2016, as well as allegedly assaulting him \u2018near the end of 2016 and continuing into 2017\u2019.  Rob is accusing Chyna of assault and battery (Picture: The Blast / MEGA)  Rob claims that E! Network declined to offer the couple another season of their reality show Rob & Chyna due to their relationship being \u2018beyond repair\u2019.  The lawsuit claims Chyna was paid \u2018$92,500 for every 60 minute episode and $112,350 for every 90 minute episode in which she appeared\u2019.  He also claims that she then trashed the house,which he was renting from his sister Kylie Jenner and which was documented on a later episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  In the documents he alleges that she broke a door, damaged the walls, destroyed cell phones, damaged a TV \u2013 and perhaps most upsetting of all, smashed a gingerbread house that had been created for the Christmas holidays.  Kylie is also a plaintiff on the lawsuit Picture: Valerie Macon/Getty Images for Taste of Beverly Hills)  In the same lawsuit, Kylie has reportedly estimated the damage to the house was in excess of $100,000 (\u00a374,000) and is also suing Chyna for the costs.  The suggested attack took place in December but four months later it was discussed on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in which Kylie said: \u2018My mum calls me and apparently Chyna threw something at my television.  \u2018It\u2019s a little disrespectful and I wouldn\u2019t do that to someone else\u2019s home.\u2019  The pair split in July 2017 after months of unrest between the two.  Rob revealed the split by going on an a furious Instagram rant about his ex, and mother of his child, in which he shared Chyna\u2019s alleged new man\u2019s phone number and claimed that Rob had paid $100,000 for weight loss surgery after she welcomed her baby Dream.  He also accused her of cheating in their home and shared explicit photos that she had privately shared with Rob.  Chyna later won a temporary restraining order against Rob; in the order he was barred from any further cyberbullying of Chyna, including posting photos or videos of her, or making any personal comments about her.

The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states\u2019 consumer protection laws.

A 2019 episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" revealed that Kayne had texted Gamble to ask why none of Kris's family members had met his family, and Khloe stated, \"We tried to get to know him, but he has not been receptive in this whole thing.\" Corey and Kris adopted a puppy, Bridgette, in early 2020, and on a September 2020 episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" Gamble complained, \"Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like, 99.7 percent of all dog duties.\" Corey previously dated Sheree Buchanan, who starred on the VH1 reality series \"Atlanta Exes.\" In 2010, Buchanan was granted a temporary protection order against Gamble due to the fact that he had been following her, calling and texting her repeatedly, and had grabbed her hard enough to leave bruises on her arms and legs.

        "doc_1_text": "(1955-)  Who Is Kris Jenner?  Kris Jenner married Robert Kardashian in 1978 and they had four children before they divorced in 1991: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Robert Jr. She married Bruce Jenner (now identified as Caitlyn Jenner) that same year and started managing the family franchise. The couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie. In 2007, Keeping Up with the Kardashians aired, giving rise to several spin-offs and making the family multi-millionaires.  Early Years  Jenner was born Kristen Mary Houghton on November 5, 1955, in San Diego, California. Her father, Robert Houghton, was an aircraft engineer. Jenner has one younger sister named Karen.  When Jenner's parents divorced in 1962, her mother sold the family home in the Point Loma area of San Diego. Jenner, her mom and sister then moved to Clairemont, California, where Jenner attended Longfellow Elementary School.  A year after her parents' divorce, Jenner developed a cancerous bone tumor. Fortunately, the cancer did not spread. After undergoing surgery to remove the tumor, Jenner was given a clean bill of health.  A few years later, Jenner's mother remarried to businessman Harry Shannon. Three months after moving to Oxnard, California, Shannon's business partner ran off with all the company's money. As a result, the family moved back to San Diego.  When Jenner graduated from Clairemont High School, she was far more interested in becoming a wife and mother than going to college.  Marriage to Robert Kardashian  On July 8, 1978, Jenner married successful high-powered attorney, Robert Kardashian, whose best friend was athlete and actor O.J. Simpson. Jenner became close friends with Simpson's wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.  Jenner and Kardashian's marriage yielded four children: three daughters, Kourtney, Kim and Khlo\u00e9, and son Robert. The couple divorced in 1991.  In the 1990s, Jenner was devastated to learn that Brown Simpson had been killed and that Simpson was being accused of her murder. Kardashian gained national fame by serving on Simpson's defense team during Simpson's highly publicized trial. Simpson was ultimately acquitted of criminal charges but found liable in the civil case that followed. In 2003, Kardashian died of esophageal cancer.  READ MORE: A History of O.J. Simpson's Relationship with the Kardashian Family  Marriage to Bruce Jenner  Just after her divorce from Kardashian was final, Jenner married former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce in 1991. As a result, she became the stepmother of Bruce's children from his two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brandon and Brody Jenner. Jenner and Bruce also had two daughters of their own: Kendall and Kylie.  When Jenner married Bruce, she became not only his wife but his manager. Soon, Jenner was negotiating his endorsement deals and promoting his career as a racecar driver, in addition to directing the family franchise.  However, it was clear that Jenner and Bruce were having challenges in their marriage, as seen on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. In June 2013 the couple separated and shortly after, divorced in December 2014. The reality of their breakup was made even more clear when Bruce came out as transgender in April 2015. That fall he officially changed his name to Caitlyn and began identifying as female. The E! Network gave Caitlyn a spinoff series, called I Am Cait, documenting her gender transition.  Reality Star and 'Momager'  In 2007, Jenner met with producer Ryan Seacrest; the result was the wildly popular reality TV show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, featuring Jenner and her family living the atypical everyday lives of celebrity entrepreneurs. The show has since led to multiple spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami (later renamed Kourtney and Kim Take Miami), Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and Khlo\u00e9 and Lamar. Jenner's youngest daughters also had similar spinoffs.  Serving as the manager of her biological children's business ventures and public appearances, Jenner is a self-described \"momager,\" and credits herself with coining the term. Business ventures ascribed to the family franchise include everything from clothing, skin care and fragrance lines, to the tell-all autobiographies Kardashian Konfidential and Kris Jenner ... And All Things Kardashian.  In 2013, Jenner debuted her own daytime TV talk show. The program, however, failed to attract enough of an audience to be renewed.  Personal Life  Since 2014 Jenner has been dating entertainment businessman Corey Gamble, who is 25 years her junior.

The since-deleted photos, some of which Kardashian re-shared several times as Instagram removed them from the website, showed Chyna\u2019s nude body.  Kardashian, the son of the late Robert Kardashian, was suspended from the site after also sharing a string of posts accusing Chyna of cheating on him, taking advantage of him financially and taking drugs. 'The saga played out in front of the tens of millions who follow the pair on social media.

In California, where Kardashian lives, revenge porn is a criminal offence and it is illegal to intentionally distribute \"the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person\u201d.  The penalty is up to six months in prison and a $1,000 (\u00a3770) fine. A number of legal experts have said Kardashian may have potentially violated the state's revenge porn laws.  Lisa Bloom, the women's rights lawyer who represented Mischa Barton in her recent successful civil suit against an ex to prevent revenge-porn images of her from being released, weighed in on the furore on Twitter, saying: \"Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off\".  In October 2013, the California Governor signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible prison time for those who post naked photos of their ex-partners.

In new court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, Kris Jenner, Rob and Kim Kardashian - who are named as defendants in the suit - have dismissed the reality star's claims as 'bald conclusions that have no factual support.'  Chyna, real name Angela Renee White, first filed the suit in October, blaming the family for cancellation of her reality show, which was not renewed for a second season after 2016.  She claimed E! and production team, as well as herself and Rob, were all on board and ready to shoot a second season before the show was axed.  Chyna also claimed the Kardashians defamed her and have been using their 'fame, wealth, and power' to take her down.'  Blac Chyna, real name Angela Renee White, first filed the suit in October, blaming the family for cancellation of her reality show, which was not renewed for a second season after 2016  The 29-year-old, who is the mother of Rob's daughter Dream, accused the family of throwing their weight around to hamper her career after her split with Rob  But, in a reply memorandum filed on January 10, the Kardashians point out that Chyna's own statements affirm that plans for the production the show were never set in stone.  'Plaintiff [Blac Chyna] affirmatively alleges...that on \"February 8, 2017, the E! Network sought a seven-month extension\" of its option to engage plaintiff's services on a second season of Rob & Chyna, which, according to plaintiff, gave the network until October 16, 2017 to decide whether to pick up a second season of the show,' court papers state.  The network also allegedly paid Chyna for the right to extend its option and even paid her to appear on four episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians at the rate she would have been paid for Rob & Chyna.  'These allegations establish that the plaintiff had no contractual right under her 2016 Talent Agreement with E! to actually be engaged for a second season of [the show],' and therefore she could not claim the family interfered, attorneys for the Kardashians said.  The 29-year-old, who is the mother of Rob's daughter Dream, also accused the family of defamation after they alleged she left her baby home alone while she went to a party.  The family argued that they did in fact say she left her daughter at home, but said Chyna left the baby with the nanny.  Chyna also accused the family of libel while referencing a story allegedly posted by TMZ.  'That paragraph, however, does not identify any allegedly false written statements made by the defendants,' the court papers read.  Attorneys for the family also noted that Chyna's last filing was her 'second attempt to plead viable causes of action' but has failed to fix them.  Better times: Things were not always tense between the Kardashians and Blac Chyna. Above they are pictured at Kim's birthday in 2013. Chyna first named the entire family in the suit, but is now suing Kris Jenner, Kim and Rob only  The former stripper alleged that the family funded 'a bogus lawsuit' filed by Rob after he accused her of assault, battery, and vandalism last year  They also requested for her complaint to be sustained and not amended.  The court filing comes weeks after the former stripper accused the family of throwing their weight around to hamper her career after her split with Rob.  'The unwritten rule no one told [her] when she began her relationship with Kardashian is that the entire family will come after you if you leave,' Chyna said in an earlier court filing.  The salon owner said that the Kardashians have no hesitation 'about using their fame, wealth and power to take you down, including getting your television show cancelled... and spreading lies about you' if you fall on their bad side.  Chyna said that the reason they were aggressive in their attacks on her was to curtail her success in fields they compete in, such as social media and products like cosmetics.  Chyna said that the family funded 'a bogus lawsuit about a crumbled gingerbread house,' referencing a lawsuit Rob filed last fall accusing Chyna of assault, battery and vandalism, according to TMZ.  In a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim addressed the feud between her brother and Blac Chyna  Rob claimed that she had destroyed a gingerbread house during a December 2016 meltdown in which she hit him in the face, attempted to choke him with an iPhone cord, and amassed more than $100,000 in damage to a property he'd rented from Kylie Jenner in tearing up the walls and a door, and destroying a TV.  In that suit, Rob said that the incident was the real reason E! cancelled their show, saying that the circumstances were too mercurial.  Lawyers for the Kardashians have said the family is not responsible for Rob & Chyna's cancellation, saying that production could not continue after Chyna obtained a restraining order against Rob last summer.",

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa, she received public attention after being cast in the reality television series 16 and Pregnant in 2009, which documented the pregnancies and first months of motherhood for several young women. Later that year, she was cast in the spin-off series Teen Mom, and appeared in each of its four seasons until its conclusion in 2012. That August, she released her debut studio album and first memoir, both of which were titled My Teenage Dream Ended. The book made it onto The New York Times bestseller list.[4]  Early life  Farrah Abraham was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa.[3] Her father, Michael Abraham, is of Syrian and Italian descent. Her mother, Debra Danielsen, is of Danish and Sicilian ancestry.[5][6][7] She grew up with her half-sister, Ashley Danielson. Her parents divorced in 2010 and in 2017, her mother married David Merz.[8]  Career  16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom  In 2008, Abraham, then 17, was selected to appear on the MTV show, 16 and Pregnant, a reality series that aimed to document the lives of pregnant teenagers across the United States.[9][2] News of her pregnancy caused issues between her and her mother, Debra Danielsen, with Danielsen calling her daughter a whore and preventing her from obtaining an abortion; being pregnant, Abraham was forced to discontinue her cheerleading.[10][9] Furthermore, during filming, Derek Underwood, the father of her child, died in a car accident.[11] Abraham gave birth to the couple's daughter, Sophia Laurent Abraham, on February 23, 2009.[12][13] Abraham's episode of 16 and Pregnant aired in 2009.  Later that year she was cast in the spin-off series Teen Mom; it followed Abraham, in addition to Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell and Amber Portwood, who also appeared on episodes of 16 and Pregnant, during their first years of motherhood.[14] The series premiere was broadcast on December 8, 2009.[15] Abraham and her mother are seen to have a rocky relationship throughout Teen Mom, with Danielson being charged with assault in an Iowa court for hitting her in January 2010.[16] Abraham started seeing a therapist to discuss the rocky relationship with her family, because she couldn't cope with her mother's actions as well as dealing with her emotions regarding Sophia's father, Derek Underwood and his death. Farrah eventually proved to Derek's family through a paternity test that Derek was in fact Sophia's father and then was faced with a lawsuit filed by Derek's mother for grandparents' visitation rights, despite no previous contact with Sophia.  In 2011, she began attending the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in Florida, where she got an associate degree in culinary arts and management. She later launched the \"Mom & Me\" pasta sauce line.[17]  On August 1, 2012, Abraham ventured into the music industry with the release of her debut studio album My Teenage Dream Ended.[18] It received overwhelmingly negative reviews from contemporary music critics, but has since been reappraised as avant-garde outsider art.[19][20] Abraham released a memoir by the same title on August 14.[21] After airing four seasons, the series finale of Teen Mom aired on August 29, 2012.[22]  In January 2014, Abraham was cast for the fourth season of Couples Therapy. However, Brian Dawe claimed that he was hired by Abraham to appear as her on-screen boyfriend and ultimately did not appear on the program alongside her.[23] Abraham consequently became the only cast member in series history to continue therapy without a partner, and was refocused on repairing her relationship with her mother.[24]  With her previous allegations of rape placing a strain on her partnership with Vivid Entertainment, a press release announcing her second sex tape Farrah 2: Backdoor and More in February stated: \"it's no 'fake' 'leak'\u2014it's the real, raw, ridiculous deal, and it suits Farrah's underhanded personality herself.\"[25] Farrah reportedly earned $1 million selling her sex tape with James Deen.[26] Later that month, Abraham appeared in the TV special Being Farrah, a continuation of Teen Mom; Bookout, Lowell, and Portwood were featured in the specials Being Maci, Being Catelynn, and Being Amber, respectively.[27] Their successes prompted MTV to consider reviving the series without Abraham, who the other women were concerned was an inappropriate influence on their children.[28]  In March 2014, Abraham returned to the music industry with the release of the song \"Blowin'\" and the simultaneous premiere of its accompanying music video. She stated that she treats music as a \"hobby, not my career move.\"[29] In August 2014, she signed a contract with Palazio's Gentleman's Club in Austin, Texas, for $544,000 for a residency until New Year's Eve.[citation needed]  In October 2017, Farrah was fired from the show by producer Morgan J. Freeman because of her work in the adult entertainment industry.[30] She was later replaced by Bristol Palin and Cheyenne Floyd.  Big Brother  In 2015, Abraham appeared on the 16th series of the British television series Celebrity Big Brother, representing the United States. On September 18, she became the fifth housemate to be evicted. She was not in the top four highest-voted housemates, and her fellow housemate, Austin Armacost, chose to evict her. She had spent 23 days in the house.[31]  On 22 September 2015, she appeared as a panelist on the Celebrity Big Brother's Bit on the Side after-show and got into a heated argument with fellow panelist, Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. The show was taken off air 10 minutes early after a \"clash\" between panelists.

        "doc_1_text": "Kristen Stewart's Cheating Apology: PR Insider Weighs In  Today, on the heels of an impending US Weekly cover story revealing a scandalous affair with her married \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" director Rupert Sanders, Kristen Stewart issued a revelatory apology exclusively to People, in which she publicly professed her love for boyfriend Robert Pattinson for the first time. Sanders responded with an equally candid statement to People, wherein he apologized for the pain caused to his wife (model Liberty Ross) and their two young children.  We couldn't help but wonder: What could cause this drop of bombshells? We enlisted the help of an entertainment PR contact, who shed some light on Wednesday's highly unorthodox turn of events.  So this is all pretty crazy, huh?  It smacks of being forced to do it -- did she come clean to Rob and he insisted she publicly apologize? Did Sanders' wife insist that they both publicly apologize? This is the sort of thing famous people generally don't acknowledge unless there's a divorce involved.  There are scans of the US Weekly story online now. What do you think of the photos?  Why don't people just get hotel rooms like they used to?  And this is really the first time Kristen has officially admitted she and Rob are a couple.  I think that's part of the mystery -- why is she acknowledging it now?  So what's your take on both Stewart and Sanders' statements to People?  What's interesting is that neither statement goes for the traditional \"This is a very difficult and personal time and I ask everyone to respect my family's privacy.\" This feels like something she may have conceivably written herself. Those statements are always worked over by a team of people. What everyone is calling out is what's accurate -- that it's strangely authentic-sounding.  So why make any statement at all, authentic or otherwise?  Presumably, Us Weekly wouldn't kill the story, as I can only assume they tried to do. People is a safe place. They ran her statement with the barest of facts, and no editorializing on the nature of the affair. It also helps set them up as the ones to talk to her as the scandal unfolds.  Do you think there's something additional that'll unfold from this? Perhaps, a pregnancy?  Oh God, I hope not. I'm sure it adds fuel to the fire for those who assumed that Kristen was Rob's beard for the past several years. If she's been acting as his beard, this is an easy way to break them up around the time that the [\"Twilight\"] franchise ends. People have said that from the beginning.  It's doubly shocking because everyone has presumed that Rob and Kristen have been dating for the past four years, but they've never officially acknowledged it until what happened today.  I believe they've just started to tentatively talk about their relationship publicly. Which is why it smacks of something like, \"If you want to stay with me, you need to publicly apologize.\" The bottom line is that it feels like high school drama.  Do you think Stewart's PR team is botching things with this?  One could argue that Kristen Stewart has showed more emotion and likeability in the past 24 hours than she has in years. I think it's calculated to make her look sympathetic in the wake of cheating on her long-term boyfriend, but other than that, I still think someone is making her publicly apologize.  What about that, \"I love him, I love him\" line? Kind of dramatic, no?  Absolutely. It's that detail that makes people think it's actually from her, and not just a stock apology.  So under what circumstances does issuing a public apology like this -- so frank and seemingly heartfelt -- make sense?  There doesn't seem to be any reason for her to be this candid. Which is why I suspect it was a condition of saving everyone's relationships. It's as though my high school boyfriend cheated on me, begged my forgiveness, and I made him stand up on the cafeteria table and admit to everyone that he had been an asshole, you know?",

And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.  CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart \u2013 OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw \u2014 Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the \u201cTwilight\u2019s\u201d Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman,\u201d who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson\u2019s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said \u201cthere\u2019s trouble in paradise,\u201d with regards to Stewart and Maxwell\u2019s relationship.  In April, the Twilight stars were reported to have \u201cgotten together a few times over the past several weeks,\u201d according to OK!  \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep it low-key, but there\u2019s still chemistry there,\u201d a source told OK! \u201cPeople in their circles are starting to wonder if they\u2019re considering a reconciliation.\u201d  Supposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is \u201cserious\u201d about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!

However, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation. According to the Daily Mail, Stewart and Pattinson were spotted together at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles over the weekend. The couple, who have been seen together multiple times in recent weeks, looked like they were having a chill time together outside a party.\n\nPattinson, who found fame playing Edward Cullen in the Twilight franchise, revealed that he almost got fired from the role because he took it too seriously. He told Howard Stern on his Sirius XM show that producers gave him a copy of the book the film was based on and every time his character smiled, they highlighted it. However, his agents warned him that he needed to act opposite to what he was doing or he would get fired.\n\nDespite the rocky patch in their relationship, Pattinson has been open about his engagement to FKA Twigs. He revealed that fame impacts a relationship and the couple has faced racist comments on social media because she is black. Pattinson also spoke about the challenges of dating anyone while in the entertainment industry.\n\nIf there is a possibility of a reconciliation between Pattinson and Stewart, Twihards on Twitter can hardly contain their excitement. It remains to be seen if the rumors are true, but one thing is for sure, fans are curious to know what is going on between the two.",

Like any other celebrity affairs, even their relationship was constantly under media\u2019s radar. Kristen\u2019s fans even stated that Robert made a hasty decision when he decided to marry Tahliah Barnett. Things started to go awry when it was recently reported that Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs are no longer a couple and it is Katy Perry who is mentally supporting the actor during this tough time.  Robert Pattinson\u2019s personal life has remained the talk of tinsel town ever since it was first reported that he had feelings for his Twilight movie co-star Kristen Stewart. The couple dated for several years, but when the reports of Kristen\u2019s alleged affair with Rupert Sanders surfaced, the Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire movie actor decided to end his affair with her.  Even after Kristen issued a public apology, Robert did not come back to her and decided to move on with FKA Twigs.  As earlier reported by the Inquisitr, Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs have reportedly ended their two-year long engagement. During this tough time, Robert is leaning on his good friend Katy Perry.  \u201cAs far as Katy goes, they have been good friends for a while. They have many mutual friends and have always kept in touch. They aren\u2019t serious as of now, but Rob has always had an interest in Katy,\u201d says E!\u2019s source.  Another source confirmed that ever since Robert\u2019s split with FKA Twigs, he has been \u201cleaning a lot on Katy.\u201d  \u201cThey talk on the phone regularly and make sure to see each other when they both aren\u2019t away working. Katy has always been a good friend to Rob over the years and has been there for him emotionally,\u201d the source added.  Katy is currently busy with her world tour, so according to the reports, she FaceTimes Robert whenever possible.  \u201cShe wants to make sure he is doing OK. Rob knows how good of a friend she is and he was also there for her when she was going through her divorce. They lean on each other.\u201d  Apparently, this is not the first time that Robert Pattinson\u2019s name has been linked with Katy Perry. Back in 2013, when the Twilight actor walked away from Kristen, many media outlets speculated that the \u201cChained To The Rhythm\u201d singer was reportedly thinking about getting romantically involved with the actor.  The award-winner singer had to message Kristen explaining that she was simply being a good friend to Pattinson in the wake of his split and there was nothing romantically going on between the two of them.  \u201cI sent her a text message saying: \u2018I know you\u2019ve seen all this stuff but you know I would never disrespect you. I\u2019m not that person,'\u201d Katy told Elle UK. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be a friend to him but it is unfortunate that I do have a set of t*ts.\u201d  Robert was also spotted with Katy Perry in early August during a dinner outing in Hollywood and many fans speculated that Robert has reportedly decided to end his engagement with FKA Twigs and will soon announce his inclination for Orlando Bloom\u2019s ex-girlfriend.  As of this writing, there are multiple reports confirming Robert Pattinson, FKA Twigs\u2019 split. However, an official statement from the stars or their respective representatives is still awaited. On the other hand, as reported above, Katy Perry is extremely busy with her ongoing world tour.  [Featured Image by Mark Davis/Getty Images]",

When asked by GQ if he was getting married in an interview for the September cover, Pattinson responded with a noncommittal \u201ceh.\u201d  Rumors of a split were heightened when the Twilight star was spotted having dinner in Los Angeles with Katy Perry and a group of friends earlier this month. A source close to Pattinson told PEOPLE the two were \u201cjust friends.\u201d  \u201cThey\u2019re super cuddly always,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other forever.\u201d  Twigs and Breitenstein also seemed close while sightseeing on the Spanish island, with the two talking closely at one point, Breitenstein resting his lips on her head.  Pattinson told Stern he prefers to keep his personal life private in order to protect both twigs and their relationship.  \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most frustrating things in the world, you want to be able to [be more open], but it\u2019s literally like, you get stuck in this position but you have to make this decision whether you want to let the crazy people in,\u201d said the actor. \u201cI mean basically, for whatever reason with Twilight \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether it is a specific thing with the audience \u2013 there\u2019s like a crack group of crazies that think every single decision you\u2019re making is either creating some kind of conspiracy\u2026\u201d  \u201cSo you kind of think, like, to protect it, I want to create a big boundary,\u201d said Pattinson.  The couple have previously been candid about the online bullying that twigs, 29, has dealt with since going public with the Twilight star.  Relationship status aside, Pattinson couldn\u2019t help but chime in when Stern praised twigs, agreeing, \u201cshe\u2019s amazing\u201d and gushing that \u201cshe\u2019s like super talented.\u201d",

Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.\u201d  While there\u2019s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it\u2019s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it\u2019s \u201cgreat\u201d that they\u2019ve \u201cfinally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will\u2014she was his first real love.\u201d As for Kristen, she \u201cfeels a little awkward when she sees Rob,\u201d because she still \u201ccarries a lot of guilt\u201d from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that \u201ceverything is good between them, and he doesn\u2019t harbor any bad feelings towards her.\u201d  Too bad, Twilight fans. Bella\u2019s not getting back with Edward \u2013 or Jacob, for that matter.

Oh well.  Prior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a \u201clow-key meet-up\u201d in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles\u2019 Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could \u201cmaybe start over again \u2026but this time it means forever.\u201d Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer\u2019s books.",

On Monday, Robert Pattinson was in attendance for the 27th Annual IFP Gotham Awards in New York City where he was nominated for his new film \"Good Time.\" But before he headed straight for the prestigious event, the 31-year-old actor lounged around the red carpet and dished about his experiences with an entirely different film: The \"Twilight\" saga.  It had been five years since the final \"Twilight\" film had been released, \"Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part Two,\" and in an interview with E! News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how \"amazing\" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.  \"It's all fond memories,\" Pattinson remarked about filming the \"Twilight\" movies. \"I mean it's almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it's just such a magical way to spend your 20s.\"  \"I mean it's completely crazy. I still haven't really processed it. I mean I always thought that there'd be more of a fallout\u2014a psychological fallout years later,\" the actor adds.  His remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow \"Twilight\" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise. In fact, she was actually surprised that so much time had already gone by since they filmed the last \"Twilight\" film. Stewart had also shared how lucky she was to have been part of such an experience and that she has taken a lot from the franchise going so far as to say that the film series has made her what she is today.  Based on the popular novel series by Stephenie Meyer, the first \"Twilight\" film was released in 2008 and was an instant success spanning five films and grossing over $3 billion all in all.",

And while the rest of the X-Men are present throughout, Sophie Turner\u2019s Jean Grey is at the forefront of the mayhem.  The photos, published by Entertainment Weekly, give X-Men fans a first look at the next film in the saga, X-Men: Dark Phoenix.  Set almost 10 years after the events of X-Men: Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix is looking to redeem the X-Men universe of the tragedy that was X-Men: The Last Stand (2006); The Last Stand originally acted as a crude adaptation of Marvel\u2019s The Dark Phoenix Saga (1980), which the upcoming Dark Phoenix is based on, as well.  But just what is this story about? It\u2019s nice of you to ask. In the Dark Phoenix Saga, the X-Men are making their way back to Earth from an off-planet mission and get caught up in a solar flare. Jean Grey (recently portrayed by Turner in the films) sacrifices herself and is exposed to a ridiculous amount of radiation that briefly unlocks her full psychic potential. With this power, she embodies the \u201cPhoenix,\u201d a terrifyingly deadly alter ego without much self-control. Throughout Saga, Phoenix battles the X-Men, commits genocide, and aligns herself with former enemies in order to gain more power.  As the upcoming Dark Phoenix is expected to emulate the Dark Phoenix Saga, Charles Xavier\u2019s X-Men should probably be on the lookout for a total meltdown.

The film is set almost 10 years after the events of X-Men: Apocalypse and is expected to emulate the Dark Phoenix Saga, which sees Jean Grey sacrifice herself and become the terrifyingly deadly Phoenix.

        "doc_1_text": "Chris Evans and Jenny Slate have broken up again, according to the New York Times .  Evans and Slate had an on-again, off-again relationship that the internet loved.  INSIDER spoke with relationship experts to find out why getting back together with an ex is almost always a bad idea.  Advertisement    Once again, Chris Evans and Jenny Slate have broken up, according to a recent New York Times profile of Evans.  The profile doesn't go into too much detail as to what caused the breakup. In fact, it is only mentioned at all because Evans refers to a feminist text, \"The Mother of All Questions\" by Rebecca Solnit, that he read while dating Slate. But anyone who has ever experienced any sort of on-again-off-again relationships like Evans and Slate's likely has some inkling as to what happened. After all, getting back with an ex rarely, if ever, works out quite the way you'd like it to.  INSIDER spoke with relationship experts to find out why.  It encourages an unhealthy behavior pattern.  \"Jenny Slate and Chris Evans have broken up before, and there is a really good chance they're going to get back together \u2014 and break up again,\" relationship expert April Masini, who hosts an online relationship advice forum, told INSIDER. \"When breakups become the way that you deal with relationship conflicts, you're in a bad behavioral pattern.\"  Advertisement  This can become a source of strain in one's daily life. \"Drama replaces problem solving and breakups become a very disruptive part of the relationship dynamic,\" Masini said.  It makes everything more confusing.  Often, ending a relationship isn't as clear-cut as many of us would like it to be \u2014 if you care about someone deeply, the act of breaking up with them isn't going to change that. This can make it easy to think that getting back with an ex is a good idea.  \"When a couple does get back together, what it tells you is that there is a lot that's good and a lot that works,\" Susan Winter, a relationship expert and best-selling author, told INSIDER. \"But there are also issues that haven't been fixed. Chances are, [Evans and Slate] like each other as people, which makes this tough.\"  As anyone who has reunited with an ex can probably attest, it also tends to be more trouble than it's worth.  Advertisement  \"Unless values, priorities, or the person in general has significantly shifted, restarting an ended relationship is typically not worthwhile,\" relationship expert Rachel DeAlto told INSIDER. \"In this case, the issues that appeared to exist (differences in levels of fame and insecurities) didn't change. Love can't conquer everything.\"  Evans and Slate reportedly started their relationship while filming the movie \"Gifted.\" Fox Searchlight  It's possible that the reconciliation is to benefit outside sources, rather than the ones in the relationship.  Have you ever gotten back together with an ex simply because you're in the same friend group, and your friends think you were so great together, and, well, it's just easier to be together? Evans and Slate may have been following the same line of thinking.  \"They're a great odd couple, and Hollywood loves an odd couple romance,\" Masini told INSIDER. \"And they're not insusceptible to what fans love to see, which makes their issues even tougher.\"  Not everyone has fans, of course, but most people have outside influences \u2014 like friends and family \u2014 who can shape our thinking and behavior without us realizing it. So, if you're ever thinking about getting back together with an ex, think about if it's something that you really want, or just something you have been told to want.  Advertisement  A breakup can incite positive change \u2014 if you stick to it.  The good news? As tough as they are, breakups can often lead to some positive change.  \"A breakup can be an enormous motivator to improve ourselves,\" Winter said. \"The clients that come to me and tell me they've lost somebody they love are so incredibly motivated to correct and change things about themselves and their personality. I've seen it help people get into sobriety, I've seen it make philanderers get clear on the reason why they couldn't commit, I've seen people take anger management and sensitivity courses. I've seen all types of change.\"  No word yet on if Evans and Slate will heed this advice \u2014 but, chances are, it's something that we can all benefit from hearing.",

        "doc_2_text": "Before Robert Pattinson was a world-famous Hollywood actor he was just a kid living in London, attending school with his mates. But on Tuesday\u2019s Stern Show, Rob came clean to Howard about getting expelled from classes after he was caught shoplifting dirty magazines in his youth.  \u201cI\u2019ve never actually said this before,\u201d Rob said with a laugh. \u201cI was, like, stealing porno magazines and selling them at school.\u201d  The X-rated mags fetched Rob a pretty penny, too. \u201cI would sell it for like 20 pounds \u2026 like 30 bucks,\u201d he told Howard.  While he started out swiping just one or two magazines from the store at a time, Rob then tried to up his haul. \u201cI got so cocky that I would take the entire rack,\u201d he admitted. That\u2019s when he got noticed by a store employee who caught him with a backpack full of porn and gave Rob the option of having him call the cops or call his parents. Begrudgingly, Rob told him to call his parents. However, the store clerk also ratted Rob out to his school, hence why he was expelled.  Prior to pilfering porno, Rob said he used to steal candy, especially wearable candy bracelets that he told Howard he used to be \u201cobsessed\u201d with.  \u201cI liked stealing things a lot,\u201d Rob said. \u201cYou can definitely get high off it.\u201d  \u201cGary, do me a favor \u2014 make sure nothing\u2019s missing from the green room,\u201d Howard joked.  Now on the straight and narrow, the only thing Rob steals is audience\u2019s hearts. Pattinson became a household name after five turns as Edward Cullen in the \u201cTwilight\u201d films, but on Tuesday he told Howard how close he came to actually getting fired from the famous movie franchise. According to Rob, he wanted his young vampire character to be much more brooding than the film\u2019s producers who requested he lighten up a bit whenever cameras were rolling.  \u201cI remember the producers giving me a copy of the book,\u201d Rob told Howard. \u201cEvery single instance where my character smiled and stuff, they\u2019d highlighted.\u201d  Rob said he then took his own highlighter to the book and underlined each and every time his character frowned or showed emotion. His agent was eventually flown in to have a frank conversation with Rob and explain if he didn\u2019t change his character\u2019s attitude, he might be out of a job. He told Howard he returned to set with a smile on his face.  \u201cI was probably going a little bit too miserable so there was some kind of compromise made,\u201d Rob said.  Even though he\u2019s been deemed the Sexiest Man Alive by multiple publications throughout the years, Rob told Howard he prefers to keep his shirt on, especially while on a movie set. He joked about \u201cTwilight\u201d director Catherine Hardwicke even telling him to cover up while shooting the first film.  \u201cI took it off and she told me to put it back on again,\u201d Rob said.  He\u2019s also all but ruled out starring in a superhero franchise due to the dedication needed in the gym in order to achieve the ripped body expected of a caped crime fighter. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how people do it, at all,\u201d Rob said with a laugh of actors who work out nonstop.  Rob is playing just about the opposite of a superhero in his new movie \u201cGood Time\u201d which tells the story of a bank robbery gone wrong. The movie is set in New York and Howard was impressed in Pattinson\u2019s ability to shed his English accent for a thick Queens dialect.  \u201cI was just hanging out in New York for ages,\u201d Rob explained to Howard. He even tried out his accent while in character at a Yonkers auto body shop, just to test its authenticity.  Accents have never been an issue for Rob, who said he used to always walk into auditions speaking like an American rather than a Brit in an effort to convince casting directors he was right for a part. He would go so far as to lie and say he was from Denver before launching into an accent from another region in the U.S.  \u201cThe only thing that anyone could see me as [being in] was period dramas,\u201d Rob said of auditioning with his English accent intact. As an American, though, he was able to land many of the roles he wanted.  Howard asked Rob about his current relationship with singer-songwriter FKA Twigs. The two have been together for nearly three years but Rob revealed many in \u201cTwilight\u201d nation have a problem with him dating her, some going so far as to make racist remarks online about her.  \u201cThey get so addicted to kind of just wanting to cause hurt and pain on someone,\u201d Rob said of internet trolls. \u201cIt\u2019s a faceless enemy.\u201d  Many a woman would consider falling in love with Rob a dream come true, but he made it clear there are plenty of disadvantages to dating him: crazed fans, limited privacy, and a hectic schedule.  \u201cThey may think they want to have a relationship with you, but if they start having a relationship with you they actually realize, like, \u2018Oh, this is not what I want at all,\u2019\u201d Rob said. \u201cIt actually kind of narrows things down.\u201d  See Robert Pattinson in \u201cGood Time\u201d opening in New York and Los Angeles Aug. 11, in theaters everywhere Aug. 25.",

In an interview with Deadline, he recently said: \"When I came to doing the first 'Twilight', I actually felt I had a lot more control over my performance, because I didn't really realize what it was. And that was because of Catherine Hardwicke, as well - she made it so malleable, which it can be when nobody knows what something is.  \"I really liked doing all of those films, but on the first one I definitely felt like, because we hadn't set the footprint for the thing ...

There have been speculations going around the Internet that Amber Heard and her billionaire ex-boyfriend Elon Musk have gotten back together when photos of them hanging out began to circulate online. Just recently these rumors were even more intensified when the pair were caught kissing after spending lunch together in Los Angeles last week. This comes four months after the couple split. However, according to a source close to the couple, this isn't exactly the case.  \"Amber invited Elon to her favorite Texas-breakfast spot,\" said the source who happened to be close to Musk. \"They shared a quick kiss goodbye. They're still just friends, not trying to get back together,\" the insider added.  Heard and Musk first got together just after the end of their previous relationships. Heard had just gone through a rough divorce with actor Johnny Depp while Musk was in the process of divorcing his wife, \"Westworld\" actress Talulah Riley.  It is believed that the former couple had first begun dating as early as the summer of 2016 but have only gone public with their relationship a few months after. Both Heard and Musk confirmed their relationship with an Instagram post featuring the 46-year-old with a kiss mark on his cheek with the \"Aquaman\" star sitting beside him.  Sadly, their relationship would not last with both of them acknowledging their busy schedules as the reason for their breakup. However, despite their split, both had remained quite good friends and were occasionally spotted getting together from time to time. Both parties claimed they still deeply cared about each other but Elon Musk did admit in an interview with Rolling Stone that it was Amber Heard who decided to break up with him.  \"She broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think,\" Musk said back in November. \"I was really in love, and it hurt bad,\" he added.",

Ever since then, the movie actress has been linked with other girls from tinsel town but there are reports that suggest that her latest affair with Victoria Secret Model Stella Maxwell is getting more serious with each passing day.

Kristen Stewart Lesbian Romance Spree  The \u201cAmerican Ultra\u201d movie actress amazed everyone when she came out as a lesbian. Her fans were baffled as they were hoping that sooner or later Robert would forgive her and they both would get back together. However, after some leaked images it was confirmed to the fans that Kristen was romantically involved with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile.  However, the affair with Cargile did not last long as OK! magazine recently reported that Kristen and Miley Cyrus ex-girlfriend Stella have decided to move in together at the actress\u2019 four-bedroom apartment in L.A.  The report further claimed that the star has reportedly decided to marry her before the end of this year.  Gossip Cop, however, debunked the OK! Magazine\u2019s claims that the new couple has decided to marry. After confirming from the star\u2019s representatives, Gossip Cop reported that Kristen is not in any hurry to marry anyone as she is deeply involved with her film projects, but the reports of them living together are in fact true.  Kristen\u2019s mother Jules Mann approves of her daughter being a lesbian  Back when Kristen was involved with Cargile, her mother Jules Mann-Stewart told The Mirror that she has met her daughter\u2019s girlfriend and found her to be a very lovely girl.  The 57-year-old Mann told the publication outlet that her daughter is apparently very happy and it is all that matters to her.  She further added that she has accepted the fact that her daughter loves both women and men. Mann went on to explain that as everyone is free to choose their friends they all are allowed to choose their love partners.

But from the looks of her earlier interview, it looks like she will give her blessings if in future the couple decides to get married.  But a recent report from OK! suggest that Kristen's mother is not happy with Stella as she thinks that the Victoria Secret Model is a bad influence on her daughter and does not wish her daughter to continue with this relationship. That being said, as Inquisitr reported, Kristen and Stella recently rescued a dog and adopted him.

Referencing the Lionsgate CEO who recently said that there are \"more stories to be told\" within the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises, Robert was asked whether or not he'd be open to reprising his role.  First he responded by throwing his hands up in the air with a \"faux-enthusiastic\" \"yes,\" but then backtracked, saying: \u201cWell, you never know.\"  \"It did inspire me at the time,\" he continued, \"And, really, it\u2019s kind of awesome. It\u2019s the way people interpret it. People would excuse you for not taking something seriously if it becomes this mainstream thing and everyone\u2019s fiending. I took it just as seriously \u2014 more seriously \u2014 than other things I\u2019ve done.\u201d  He also talked about developing what's being referred to as \"paparazzi PTSD\" from the ordeal. And as for the term \"franchises,\" Pattinson doesn't support it.  \u201cI remember when \u2018Twilight\u2019 first came out, it was the first time I\u2019d really heard film series be referred to as \u2018franchises,\u2018\u201d Pattinson said. \u201cAnd then you see everyone talking about the word \u2018franchise\u2019 as if it\u2019s this revered term. \u2018Franchise\u2019 should not be about a movie. That\u2019s a fast-food restaurant. Everyone was like \u2018the franchise, the franchise\u2019 the whole time. I just thought, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 It\u2019s rote. All these actors are saying \u2018franchise\u2019 \u2015 it\u2019s like, what are you doing? You\u2019ve drunk the Kool-Aid!\u201d  It seems throughout the conversation, Robert is outlining and illustrating his desire to re-define himself as an actor outside of a young adult cult fiction series, but he also doesn't seem 100% deterred from reprising the role of Edward.

WE TV\u2019s \u201cMarriage Boot Camp\u201d is set to premiere on September 7. US Weekly caught up with the \u201cJersey Shore Family Vacation\u201d star at the premiere party.

Vanessa allegedly found emails between Aubrey and her husband where he promised he would be leaving his marriage for her.

        "doc_1_text": "In the history of Hollywood, certain co-stars stand out as the most dynamic duos whose chemistry jumps out from the screen. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, and the more recent partnership of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The last pair has starred together in three films, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster Squad, and La La Land. Moviegoers can't get enough of the somewhat offbeat pair, and Emma Stone's recent comments on Ryan Gosling prove that the co-stars can't get enough of each other, either.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Stone spoke about Gosling at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival during a Q&A on Sept. 1. \"I can\u2019t even imagine what my life would be without Ryan,\" Stone said. The Battle of the Sexes star went on, saying, \"He\u2019s so special. It makes me emotional. He\u2019s so talented but he\u2019s such a great person to work with because he\u2019s so collaborative and excited about the process. He\u2019s taught me a lot about being really generous.\" Stone continued to tell the audience about her \"dear, wonderful friend\" after an audience member asked about why the La La Land co-stars have so much chemistry. She said, \"The moment he walked into the audition of Crazy, Stupid, Love, we had an unspoken understanding of each other.\"  It probably won't come as a surprise to hear that fans have long-been obsessing over the duo who first stole everyone's hearts in Crazy Stupid Love. That movie included the unforgettable scene where Emma Stone's character freaked out over Ryan Gosling's glistening six-pack, and the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. With Stone's lovable awkwardness and Gosling's humble charm, it's no wonder that everyone wants to see the duo star in a fourth \u2014 and fifth, and sixth \u2014 movie together ASAP.  Some fans even feel that the couple's lack of co-starring role from the year might ruin awards season. Twitter user @dailyemmastone wrote, \"Yeah heartbreak is horrible, but have you ever imagine an award season with emma stone and ryan gosling doing it separately... well it's about to happen.\" At least you can take heart in the fact that Stone and Gosling likely will at least see each other on some red carpets, since Gosling's starring role in the upcoming movie First Man is already drumming up Oscar buzz as is Stone's role in the upcoming release, The Favourite.  Even though Stone and Gosling didn't star together in a new movie in time for the 2018 awards season, the duo very well could end up teaming up together in the future. After all, Gosling's admiration for Stone has long inspired fans to ship the onscreen pair. In 2011, Gosling told MTV, that Stone is \"everything, all the time,\" and then he revealed that Stone's casting in Crazy Stupid Love got him excited for his role. \"There's no one like her. As soon as she signed on for this movie, I knew it was going to be good,\" he added.  Not only did Stone and Gosling make an impression on viewers in their first movie together, but they also left their co-star Steve Carell wanting more. According to E! News, Carrell spoke about Stone and Gosling at the 2017 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Office star said, \"I hope the three of us get to work again together. They are, incidentally, two of the nicest people ever.\" At least Carrell got to reunite with Stone in 2017 with Battle of the Sexes, but fans still want to see Gosling reunite with Stone on the big screen at least one more time.",

The pair has denied it\u2014insisting they\u2019re just \u201cvery good friends.\u201d But when it came to the very important decision of adopting a dog, Efron turned to none other than his friend Daddario.  \"He was in the market for [a dog], and it\u2019s a big life decision,\" Daddario tells ELLE.com. \"He just wanted to make it as easy as possible.\"  Daddario and Efron found Maca, an adorable brown and black pit bull, at the LA-based rescue shelter called Bark n\u2019 Bitches. The dog, who was named Tilly before Efron adopted her, was about to be euthanized before the shelter took her in.  W Blanco/Backgrid  \"Maca was being led to the kill room when we stepped in and said we would take her.

I found out what rescue shelter he was at, and it was love at first sight,\u201d says Daddario, who first spotted Levon on Adopt-a-Pet.com. Now, the actress is partnering with Dogtrader.com\u2014Autotrader\u2019s new dog adoption website created with Adopt-a-Pet.com\u2014to encourage more people to adopt rescues. \u201cHe had been neglected and it was such a great feeling to bring him into my home, and to see him get happier and happier, and to feel safer and safer, and see his personality come out more.\u201d  It was Efron\u2019s offer for a doggie date with Levon (and Daddario) that sparked romance rumors from fans.

But after just a few months, things suddenly went south.  'We were dating for about three months,' she said. 'And I already knew that I was in love with him and he was hesitant because he knew he was still dating other people.  'He sat me down and said, \"I can't have this right now. I think you're wonderful, but I am still dating other people.\"  Big hit: Three months into dating, Dax told Kristen that he couldn't keep seeing her because he was dating someone else  The turnaround: Kristen was left heartbroken by the news, but claims she knew he would be coming back  Lucky man: Four days after the break-up, Dax called Kristen to beg for her to come back  'And then I, like, liquefied and fell to the ground, but I felt incredibly respected that he had the balls to tell me we weren't in the same place,' she remembered.  However, despite feeling crushed about the situation, Kristen claims that she knew that they had a special connect, and she knew that Dax would come back.  It was only four days after the break up that she got a phone call from a remorseful Dax.  Years down the line: The pair of celebrities are now married with two young daughters  Adventures together: Kristen and Dax got engaged over Twitter after waiting for gay marriage to be legalized  Jokers: Kristen added that she sometimes likes to remind her husband about the day that he dumped her  'He called me and he was like, \"I don't know what I was thinking. I was dating someone else but they're just not as interesting as you, and I don't know what I'm doing,\" and he came back,' she said.

But that doesn't discount the lovely years they had together,'\" she said. \"If I ever get divorced, I'm still going to be like, 'Wow, I loved being married to that man.'\"  VIDEO: Kristen Bell & Dax Shepard's Cutest Instagram Moments  Bell was quick to blast rumors that Pratt's rise in Hollywood played a part in the pair's split. Instead, she admitted that marriage is really hard\u2014especially when you shoot movies in faraway places without your significant other. \"It's a little more nuanced I think than people want to acknowledge. I think it's the truth,\" she said, revealing that she and husband go to couple's therapy and are careful to differentiate between a disagreement and an argument.  But at the end of the day, the actress says she chooses to remain positive after a breakup. \"I'm glad I spent my time with that person,\" she mused. \"We may have to make different choices, [and] those choices might make us sad for a while, but ultimately you have to make hard choices in life. I don't fault anyone for making them.\"  RELATED: Anna Faris and Chris Pratt Have Split and the Internet Can't Deal  Wise words, Kristen!",

The film sees Pattinson play Samuel Alabaster, more greenhorn than pioneer, as he sets off on an adventure with the love of his life, Penelope, played by Mia Wasikowska.  Pattinson said he had a \u201cgreat time\u201d playing vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight franchise and he wouldn\u2019t rule out more big-budget franchises. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a bad experience on any film I\u2019ve done, maybe one. The only reason I\u2019m a little cautious about big franchise films is that you can\u2019t make them R rated. If you have a big budget, there\u2019s more people on you to do it a [specific] way or you\u2019re fired. If you keep a budget contained, if people think they can get their money back, you can experiment more.\u201d  He added that he believed that there will be a \u201cresurgence\u201d of mid-budget movies that will allow actors to experiment more. \u201cPeople were scared when the streaming services came out, but, to me, it seems there\u2019s a second wave. There\u2019s a bunch of new studios, mid-budget filmmaking is coming back and it\u2019s great.\u201d  Pattison said he was attracted to Damsel as he was rarely offered roles in comedies. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many western comedies. In terms of the comedies, it\u2019s tough to find one that has an interesting character, you\u2019re usually playing for laughs. There\u2019s such a stable of comedy actors and I\u2019m not seen as a comedy actor so it will always go to a bunch of people before me. I found it so strange and felt like abstract version of a comedy and it appealed to me in the same way as a drama. It was really fun to play, it has an odd tone, so it was fun to try and figure out how to fit into it.\u201d  Damsel starts off as a classic western, a horseback odyssey with plenty of shootouts. However, on his way looking for love, there\u2019s a twist: Penelope, it seems, is not a damsel in distress. Wasikowska called it \u201cvery clever.\u201d  \u201cWe were led to believe one thing about this character and that gets flipped on its head,\u201d she said.  The Zellners, who also directed 2008\u2019s Goliath and 2014\u2019s Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, said that they were big fans of the western genre but didn\u2019t want to make another sepia-toned film. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fans of westerns since we were kids [but we were] bored of the clich\u00e9s and tropes. The female characters are usually pretty boring or a prize to be obtained by the hero and those elements were tiresome and not interesting so we wanted to make Penelope a complex human\u2026 and then amp it up for comedic purposes,\u201d said Nathan Zellner. Damsel is being by Great Point Media and ICM in Berlin.  Wasikowska and Pattinson were asked about the #MeToo campaign, which has been a prominent feature of the festival. Wasikowska said she thought it was \u201camazing.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve spent much of the last year in Australia so I\u2019ve been watching from afar,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Respect Rally in Sundance was the first thing I was able to be a part of. I think it\u2019s going to [lead to] really significant change.\u201d Pattinson added that being \u201cbullied into silence\u201d was one of the most awful things and that it was \u201camazing when any kind of dam breaks.\u201d  Pattinson can next be seen in Claire Denis\u2019 English-language debut High Life, alongside Juliette Binoche and Mia Goth.

The Tesla CEO spoke about his recent, emotional break up with Heard during a wide-ranging interview with Rolling Stone magazine.  'She broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think,' the 46-year-old said.  'I was really in love, and it hurt bad.'  He added that he was in 'severe emotional pain' for several weeks after.  'It hurt bad': Elon Musk reveals his vulnerable side in a candid new interview with Rolling Stone in which he says his split from Amber Heard left him in 'severe emotional pain'  The couple's split was confirmed in August after a year of dating and was put down to the strains of a long-distance relationship and busy work schedules.  At the time Elon remarked: 'Although Amber and I did break up, we are still friends, remain close and love one another.'  They were spotted out together in Australia just several days after news of their split broke.  Musk told Rolling Stone that his heartbreak over his break-up had even affected the launch of his Tesla Model 3.  'It took every ounce of will to be able to do the Model 3 event and not look like the most depressed guy around. For most of that day, I was morbid,' he said.  'And then I had to psych myself up: drink a couple of Red Bulls, hang out with positive people and then, like, tell myself: 'I have all these people depending on me. All right, do it!''

'I'm looking for a long-term relationship. I'm not looking for a one-night stand. I'm looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing,' the tech-magnate said.  'If I'm not in love, if I'm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy.'  Musk, who has five children with his first wife Justine, got emotional as he spoke of going to sleep alone.  'I will never be happy without having someone. Going to sleep alone kills me,' he said.  'I'm looking for a long-term relationship. I'm not looking for a one-night stand. I'm looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing.' he explained to Rolling Stone. He is pictured with Amber in May  Elon dated the Aquaman actress for around a year following her acrimonious split from Johnny Depp. The star is pictured on Wednesday at the GQ Men of The Year Awards in Sydney  'It's not like I don't know what that feels like: Being in a big empty house, and the footsteps echoing through the hallway, no one there \u2013 and no one on the pillow next to you. How do you make yourself happy in a situation like that?  'When I was a child, there's one thing I said: I never want to be alone. That's what I would say. I don't want to be alone.'  Elon started dating Amber fresh off the back of her split from husband Johnny Depp, 54, - who she accused of domestic abuse.  He had recently split from English actress Talulah Riley, 32, who he was married to from 2010 to 2012 and again from 2013\u20132016.

        "generated_text": "Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, has opened up about his recent breakup with Amber Heard, revealing that she was the one who ended the relationship. Musk, 46, told Rolling Stone that he was in \"severe emotional pain\" for several weeks after the breakup, which occurred in August after a year of dating. The couple's split was attributed to the strains of a long-distance relationship and busy work schedules. Despite the breakup, Musk and Heard remain friends and love one another.\n\nMusk has been married twice before, to Justine Musk and Talulah Riley, and has five children with his first wife. He admits that going to sleep alone kills him and that he is looking for a long-term relationship, not a one-night stand. \"If I'm not in love, if I'm not with a long-term companion, I cannot be happy,\" he said. Musk has been spotted out together with Heard in Australia just days after news of their split broke.\n\nMeanwhile, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have been rumored to be dating again, despite their previous breakup.

But the 23-year-old actress has now opened up about her love life decisions, insisting that while she prefers to date civilians, she doesn't like the way her relationship with them propels them into the public eye.    Emma is currently in a relationship with 21-year-old Oxford University student Matt Janney.    'I don't date famous people': Emma Watson is dating Oxford University student Matt Janney, but said she finds it difficult when a 'normal' person is thrust into the spotlight due to a romance with her    She told Australia's Elle magazine: ' I don't date people who are famous, and I don't think it's fair that, all of a sudden, intimate details of their personal life are public as a direct result of me.  'I wish I could protect them.'  Emma, who first shot to fame as Hermione Granger in Harry Potter, also revealed that her child star past sometimes makes it difficult for her to secure more mature roles.    In action: Matt (left) playing rugby for Oxford during a match against Cambridge  Opening up: Emma spoke to Australian Elle magazine about her love life    She said: ' In my downtime I don't sex myself up much. Sometimes I have a hard time convincing directors that I can play more adult roles.'  But in her personal life, Emma is doing her best to get rid of her 'good girl' image, admitting that she recently broke into a hotel swimming pool at 3am.  She said: 'It was at a hotel, it had a gate around it. My friends turned around and basically I was gone.  'The next thing they saw was me 7ft up in the air, scaling the fence. I shouldn't be able to get away with what I'm getting away with.'  Emma also revealed that she will be marking her graduation from Brown University later this year with an alcohol-fuelled celebration.    She said: 'I will be there and I will be throwing a huge party and getting very drunk.'  Emma's interview with Australian Elle magazine comes after she opened up about the ageing process in a chat with the Sunday Times Style magazine.  She said: ' I can take criticism on the chin a lot more. As a younger woman, that pressure got me down but I\u2019ve made my peace with it. With airbrushing and digital manipulation, fashion can project an unobtainable image that\u2019s dangerously unhealthy.  'I\u2019m excited about the ageing process. I\u2019m more interested in women who aren\u2019t perfect. They\u2019re more compelling.\u2019  She said: 'I'm excited about the ageing process. I'm more interested in women who aren't perfect. They're more compelling'  She said sometimes I have a hard time convincing directors that I can play more adult roles  Emma added that rather than ask a celebrity stylist for sartorial advice she turns to her mother or friends: \u2018I love showing them images and asking, \u2018What do you think of this dress?\u2019 I call on my boyfriends for advice all the time,\u2019 she says, before quickly correcting herself. \u2018I mean friends who are boys, and my girlfriends.\u2019  Miss Watson left Harry Potter behind in 2011 and said all that mattered at the time was university: \u2018I didn\u2019t even know if I wanted to be an actress.\u2019  She enrolled at Brown in the US and said she enjoyed the anonymity the American press gave her but her fame inevitably came back to haunt her.  Recalling the first day she walked into the canteen, she said: \u2018Everyone went completely silent and turned around to look at me.",

They were seen leaving a restaurant together in Los Angeles \u2013 hello, date night \u2013 and on set together. Not to mention the few times they were caught on social media hanging out. Ever since then, no one was quite sure the status of Cameron and Hailey\u2019s friendship or relationship, or whatever it is you want to call it. But, now it\u2019s probably, most definitely time to put the rumors to rest.  Hailey was spotted out during Labor Day weekend in Brooklyn, New York holding hands with a mystery man. But, after some careful investigative work, it turns out, this guy wasn\u2019t really a mystery man after all. We\u2019ve all seen and heard of him before. His name is DJ Daniel Chetrit. He was actually rumored to be dating Bella Hadid just about a month ago. The pair were seen walking around New York City and getting pretty cozy. Photos surfaced of Bella actually draping her arm around Daniel.  Now, the same kind of photos are making their way around the Internet of Hailey and DJ Daniel. *The Daily Mail swiped the pics and we can\u2019t stop staring. They look super comfortable together and totally unamused by the paparazzi following them around.  Hailey Baldwin strolls hand-in-hand with a mystery man in NYC https://t.co/48stzL2p59 \u2014 Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 7, 2017  So, are they dating? We\u2019re not exactly sure. BUT, we have a feeling that if she was romantically involved with Cameron, he probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy her running around holding hands with another guy especially in a place that she could be photographed. Also, Cameron has been rumored to be dating model Alexis Ren in the past week or so. He was caught on Snapchat with her Instagram pic as his phone background and basically admitting he has a crush on her.  Of course though, that means nothing. But, again, if he was dating Hailey he probably wouldn\u2019t be so careless when it comes to chatting up other girls. Our main takeaway here? Let\u2019s leave the idea of a Cameron and Hailey relationship in the past. Let\u2019s focus on what in the world Hailey is doing with DJ Daniel cause they would be one ~hot~ AF couple.  Love J-14?

Lately, she\u2019s become a fan favorite for her character work on hit shows like Parks and Recreation, Bob\u2019s Burgers, Hello Ladies, and Kroll Show.  Slate\u2019s brash, no-filter style makes her one of the most memeable\u2013not to mention relatable\u2013celebs out there. Sure, she pals around with famous comedians and has dated super-celebrity Chris Evans, but when push comes to shove, Jenny Slate always keeps it real. Here are 11 times she\u2019s proved that she is all of us:  1. When she accidentally dropped an f-bomb on SNL:  (Image: SNL/NBC)  Ok, so most of us will never appear on SNL, but who can\u2019t relate to dropping an f-bomb at an inopportune time? Slate famously cursed on her very first appearance on SNL. She was unceremoniously fired from the show at the season\u2019s end, and has called the experience \u201cembarrassing, devastating, humiliating, a bummer of a mistake.\u201d Years later, she\u2019s finally come out on top. She is the underdog we all see in ourselves.  2. When she thought it was a prank that Chris Evans was into her:  (Image: Comedy Central)  Slate famously dated Hollywood heartthrob Chris Evans after the two filmed the movie Gifted together. She has admitted that originally, she didn\u2019t think she was Captain America\u2019s type: \u201cEventually, when it was like, Oh, you have these feelings for me?, I was looking around like, Is this a prank? I mean, I understand why I think I\u2019m beautiful, but if you\u2019ve had a certain lifestyle and I\u2019m a very, very different type of person \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be an experiment.\u201d  3. And when she got over their breakup by watching You\u2019ve Got Mail on repeat:  (Image: Obvious Child)  Slate said she wept through You\u2019ve Got Mail \u201cso many times it was unbelievable\u201d during her breakup with Evans. She also took comfort in listening to Alanis Morrisette\u2019s infamous breakup album Jagged Little Pill on repeat. Everybody knows nothing heals a broken heart like sobbing it out to your favorite romcoms and screaming \u201cYou Oughta Know\u201d at the top of your lungs. See? All of us!  4. When she had this hilarious reaction to being told she couldn\u2019t order a Bloody Mary before noon:  5. When she refused to grow up:  (Image: Late Night Seth Meyers)  6. When she perfectly explained what modern life is like  7. When she thought her childhood stuffed animals were alive  Slate shared this gem of an anecdote with the NY Times: \u201cWhen I was little I felt that there was something alive in my stuffed animals and in this Madame Alexander doll I slept with every night named Pudding. I slept with 36 stuffed animals and they were in a specific rotation so that each could get a night sleeping next to me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt their feelings.\u201d  8. When she got lonely and begged one of her girlfriends to get drunk with her  (Image: Mae Whitman Instagram)  One night, Slate was sitting at a bar alone, reading a book about the Holocaust, and she felt a wave of loneliness. She immediately texted one of her BFFs, Mae Whitman (of NBC\u2019s Parenthood): \u201cI was just like, \u2018Can you please help me? I\u2019m so lonely.\u2019 And she came and we got shitbombed, and I woke up the next morning and saw my headphones on my neighbor\u2019s yard. I have no idea how they ended up there.\u201d  9. When she admitted she feels like an imposter adult  (Image: Obvious Child)  In an essay for Lenny Letter, Slate wrote: \u201cListen, I often walk around feeling that I\u2019m an impostor adult. I make a ton of mistakes, and if my feelings were a person, that person would have messy hair like a bird\u2019s nest (there might even be birds in there), skinned knees, and crumbs in her pockets, but also vibrant powers.\u201d  10: When she unfollowed NASA because space is just too real  (Image: Comedy Central)  When Slate made an appearance on Comedy Central\u2019s Drunk History, she shared that she had to unfollow NASA: \u201cI had to unfollow NASA on Instagram \u2018cause it made me too crazy. It would be like, \u2018here\u2019s a picture of a fucking black hole,\u2019 and I was like *SCREAMS*\u201d  11. When she was lip syncing to Beyonc\u00e9 and her dogs weren\u2019t having it",

Well, despite making their first public appearance as an official couple at the Cinderella premiere in Milan three years ago, the love between the Doctor Who and Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again stars actually began to blossom a year prior.  The pair were first introduced back in 2014 whilst working on the set of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, as Grazia reports, and speculation of a romantic relationship between Smith and James first emerged after the Mirror reported they were spotted together at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Shortly after the festival, rumours which hinted at a budding relationship between the actors only intensified after being photographed together once again, this time in London, as the Daily Mail reported.  These outings were the first time Smith and James had been romantically linked to anyone after the break up of their previous relationships with actress and model Daisy Lowe and actor Jack Fox, respectively, however it appears both have clearly moved on as they enjoy their third year together \u2014 which in celebrity terms, could be considered a lifetime.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Since they began dating the couple have enjoyed continued success in the world of acting, seen recently in Smith's Emmy Award nominated portrayal of Prince Philip in The Crown, and James' role in the Oscar-winning Darkest Hour. However, it's the recent juicy engagement rumours surrounding the two that have really got fans talking.  After displaying a huge diamond ring, as Metro reported, which just so happened to be placed on her engagement finger at the 2018 BAFTA Awards, speculation of potential nuptials was sent into overdrive. And boyfriend Smith added more fuel to the rumour-mill fire whilst speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs when he revealed he was open to the idea of having children, and soon. The 35-year-old said \"I am thinking about kids quite a lot. I\u2019d like a lot of them.\"  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  However, those rooting for a fairytale wedding in the near future were left disappointed after James briefly addressed the engagement rumours in an interview with Porter Edit. When discussing the supposed \"engagement\" ring she showed off on the BAFTAs red carpet, Lily said \"I\u2019m just not very superstitious about rings. It\u2019s stupid, probably, but I just put rings on any finger... I mean, Jesus. That ring\u2019s worth one million pounds\u2026\"  Although I wouldn't dust off your wedding hats just yet, the current lack of any plans to tie the knot isn't to say there won't be wedding bells in the future. In a recent interview with Marie Claire, James expressed the possibility of herself and Smith buying a home together when she said, \"We want to get somewhere\", and continued \"That's going like, 'Can we go furniture shopping?' We bought a rug...and I love getting flowers and making things look nice.\"  So, even though marriage might not be on the cards just yet, the prospect of an engagement between this couple sounds like it could be well on the way. Though for now it sounds like they're having lots of fun together. In James' interview with Porter, she also explained how she nearly missed Glastonbury for her Mamma Mia audition, with the clash causing a \"real argument\" between the couple. At least it all worked out for the best.",

The 20-year-old pop star opened up about both topics in Rolling Stone's December cover story, in which he got candid about his insecurities.  \"I'd like to say I don't care about it, but that's not true,\" he said of his fans speculating about his sexuality and romances, and then brought up \"this massive, massive thing for the last five years about me being gay.\"  \"In the back of my heart, I feel like I need to go be seen with someone -- like a girl -- in public, to prove to people that I'm not gay,\" he said. \"Even though in my heart I know that it's not a bad thing. There's still a piece of me that thinks that. And I hate that side of me.\"  He couldn't pinpoint why people are so convinced he's gay, but did venture to guess that growing up in Canada with 15 female cousins \"braiding hair and painting nails\" could have something to do with it.  \"Maybe I am a little more feminine -- but that's the way it is. That's why I am me,\" he said.  Before this interview, he took to Snapchat to declare his heterosexuality. \"I noticed a lot of people were saying I gave them a 'gay vibe,'\" he told millions of followers at the time in the selfie-style video. \"First of all, I'm not gay. Second of all, it shouldn't make a difference if I was or wasn't.\"  He admitted to Rolling Stone that he briefly felt jealousy when seeing other famous pop stars grabbing headlines for being photographed with their partners in public. \"I had this thought: 'I have to get paparazzied with someone. Who am I gonna get? I'm not relevant,'\" he said, but quickly ditched the idea as absurd. \"I was like, 'Ugh, you f--king idiot. Why did you think that?'\"  He was photographed holding hands with Baldwin -- a model and host of TBS' \"Drop the Mic\" -- at the Met Gala last spring, but the pair told the curious press they were just friends. Now Mendes has admitted they were, in fact, more than just friends, he's just not exactly sure what they were. \"I don't even wanna put a title on it. I think it was more of a zone of limbo,\" he said.  Once he heard the news of Baldwin's engagement to Bieber, who she had dated before hooking up with Mendes, he sent her a congratulatory text.  \"I texted Hailey, 'Congratulations,' and I really am happy for them. She's still one of the f--king coolest people ever -- she's not just a beautiful person visually, but she's one of the most beautiful hearts I've ever met,\" he declared, but stopped short of explaining how or why their brief romance ended. \"I think I'm an idiot to not, you know ... But you can't control your heart.\"  A few more fun facts about the singer young women across the globe idolize: He's got no game and he loves to smoke weed.  Despite his fame from three hit albums and the easy access to women that type of international exposure provides, he told Rolling Stone, \"Dude, I have no game,\" and stressed, \"Being good-looking doesn't make you have game.\"  \"I love weed,\" he said, but emphasized it's a habit he's not ready to attach to his image. \"I wouldn't tweet that -- not yet, at least -- but it's really good for me. When I'm home, I'll smoke and then play guitar for seven hours.\"",

Pattinson and Kristen dated for almost five years before calling it quits in 2013.  In an interview with The Sunday Times, Stewart said, \"I didn't talk about my first relationships that went public because I wanted things that are mine to be mine.

The 26-year-old said, \"If it didn't seem like a relevant topic, like something that needed help, I would have kept my life private forever. But then I can't walk outside holding somebody's hand, as I'm followed everywhere. \"  \"When I was dating Rob, the public was the enemy, and that is no way to live. [Coming out] wasn't this grand statement, 'I was so confused! Now I've realized who I am!' I have not been struggling. It just seemed important and topical,\" she added.  Revealing why she decided to make her sexuality public, Kristen explained, \"Considering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me. It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feel good about themselves\"  The actress is rumoured to be dating Belgian-Irish supermodel Stella Maxwell and the duo have been spotted kissing on numerous occasions.

Gamenguide reported earlier that the Remember Me star is currently suffering from depression and that\u2019s why he has canceled his wedding with Twigs. Now the publication has reported about their pregnancy.  According to Gamenguide, there are reports that Robert Pattinson and Tahliah Debrett Barnett are planning to have a baby so they could save their failing relationship. According to the reports, the couple is now very desperate to fix their relationship and that\u2019s why they have decided to have a baby  If these speculations about Kristen\u2019s ex-boyfriend were not enough, other sources previously claimed that the engaged couple might be headed for an end. Hollywood Life reported that Twigs and Pattinson were spotted fighting at Los Angeles Airport. The publication further noted that the couple seemed visibly upset with each other.  At the same time, iTechPost explained that the fall between the couple is because of Kristen Stewart. Patrick Wachsberger, a Lionsgate chairman, recently confirmed the possibility of a Twilight sequel, and recent rumors suggest that the actor is seriously considering to share the screen with his ex-girlfriend again.  So, there are chances that Pattinson\u2019s decision to feature in Twilight\u2019s reboot with Stewart has caused the rife between him and Twigs.  Meanwhile, Twigs was not sporting her engagement ring during their recent trip and many are believing that they have officially parted their ways. InTouch also reported that the couple\u2019s friends think that things are not going too well between them as she is very dominating.  \u201c[She] isn\u2019t the girl for him. She\u2019s very jealous and he was sick of having to explain himself,\u201d the insider added. \u201cHe\u2019s still young and just decided he wasn\u2019t ready to settle down.\u201d  Robert was recently under media radar when there were rumors that the reason why he is not marrying Tahliah is because he is gay. A hoax website claimed that Little Ashes star has come out as gay. The website, which apparently later deleted the post, falsely claimed that he cannot accept the fact that Kristen is thinking to settle down with Alicia Cargile.  \u201cI completely fell for this guy and at first I thought I was confused with my emotions and I did not want to let my female fans down. But after careful consideration, I felt it was best to come out to the public and confirm that I am gay,\u201d the website claimed that the actor told to an imaginary news station.  Apart from this fabricated news, the publication went on to claim that Gay Times magazine has offered him \u201ca multi-million dollar modeling contract.\u201d  Personal Shopper actress, Kristen Stewart, came out as a lesbian in July when she officially talked about her ongoing relationship with Cargile. During her recent interview, she talked about her sexuality and her approach towards dating.  \u201cWhen I was dating a guy I was hiding everything that I did because everything personal felt like it was immediately trivialized, so I didn\u2019t like it,\u201d she further said. \u201cWe were turned into these characters and placed into this ridiculous comic book, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s mine. You\u2019re making my relationship something that it\u2019s not.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like that. But then it changed when I started dating a girl. I was like, \u2018Actually, to hide this provides the implication that I\u2019m not down with it or I\u2019m ashamed of it, so I had to alter how I approached being in public. It opened my life up and I\u2019m so much happier.'\u201d  So, according to the hoax site, if Kristen can realize about her sexual preferences then Robert can also come out as a gay.

On night one of the season 25 finals, Scott was sent home on Monday evening after delivering his two final dances with pro partner Emma Slater.  Scott, 39, was the first celebrity contestant to kick off the night with his Paso Doble, for which he was awarded a 36/40 by Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and returning guest judge Julianne Hough.  When Scott hit the floor for his second number of the night \u2014 a freestyle \u2014 he wowed judges with his improvements and earned a near perfect score: 39/40.  \u201cIf you could recall back to week one, I said if you were a house, you\u2019d be a fixer upper. Well, let me tell you, on that performance, the house is fixed and you\u2019ve become a hot commodity,\u201d Goodman remarked of the Property Brothers star, who the head judge dubbed the \u201cmost improved dancer on this show.\u201d  Despite earning solid scores, Scott\u2019s three fellow contestants came out strong and earned higher overall scores: 76/80 for Frankie Muniz, 80/80 for Jordan Fisher and 80/80 for Lindsey Stirling.  After Stirling delivered the final dance of the night, Goodman admitted that he had \u201cno clue\u201d who will take home the Mirrorball Trophy on Tuesday night\u2019s finale.  \u201cThis is becoming the war on the floor because I\u2019m so excited about tomorrow evening because I have no clue who\u2019s going to win! It\u2019s just become a fantastic competition,\u201d Goodman said after Stirling performed her freestyle dance.  Drew Scott/Instagram  Upon being eliminated at the end of the show, Scott reflected on his time on the reality dancing competition series.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have done anything that I did out here without her. And it\u2019s been such a ride. Look at the amazing amazing talent,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m here with these guys. Thanks to the judges and the crew and everybody, you\u2019ve made this a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d  Speaking with reporters after the show, Slater said of being eliminated: \u201cI feel awesome. There\u2019s nothing to be sad about here. There\u2019s no disappointment, no bittersweet. It\u2019s just sweet. We were absolutely stoked to be in the finals and looked at this week as a blessing and gave it our all. But like I said earlier, my measuring stick is completely different and no first place or Mirrorball is the be all end all. For me, it was just about getting to know this guy this entire season and making it all the way to the end \u2013 literally to the finals. We\u2019re missing out on one day, which is tomorrow and we\u2019re going to be there in full form anyway.\u201d  Scott said of his partner, \u201cHonestly just to be in the final four means everything. I honestly didn\u2019t think that I would make it here and it\u2019s all because of this gal right here. I couldn\u2019t thank her enough.\u201d  The season 25 Dancing with the Stars finale airs Tuesday (9 p.m. ET) on ABC.  \u2014Reporting by PATRICK GOMEZ",

        "doc_1_text": "\"Property Brothers\" star Drew Scott was sent home on first night of the finale.  \u2014 -- HGTV's \"Property Brothers\" star Drew Scott turned in his best \"Dancing With the Stars\" performance of the season Monday night, but he was ultimately sent home.  Scott and his partner, Emma Slater, said they were grateful for the opportunity to compete and make it as far as they did.  \"I'm just so grateful to even be here and to have Emma to just pull out the best in me every single week. I couldn't have asked for a better partner,\" Scott told ABC News.  Both will quickly move on to even bigger plans: their respective weddings. \"Emma and her fiance are actually teaching my fiancee and me to dance for the wedding, first dance,\" Scott revealed.  As for the rest of the competition, Scott said, \"You really never know\" who will take it all.  But Slater said it ill be Jordan Fisher. \"I'm sure it's going to be Jordan, Jordan,\" she said. \"But everybody's freestyle was so good. It could go either way.\"  The first night of the finals featured two rounds of competition. First, stars and their partners had to participate in the redemption round, for which the judges gave the stars some personal attention and direction to focus on an earlier performance that needed improvement.  Later the couples competed in the freestyles. Monday also featured special guest judge Julianne Hough, upping the ante for a potential of 40 points per dance.  The night began with judge Bruno Tonioli's arrival at a rehearsal studio dressed for a dance renovation as a construction worker, albeit a stylized version of one. He was there to work with Scott on a paso doble from an action-film paso that was not his finest moment earlier in the season.  \"I expect a transformation from you, Drew,\" Tonioli said, challenging him to sort out his shaping, artistry and timing.  After his routine, the judges called it his best dance, earning him and Slater a 36 out of 40.  Carrie Ann Inaba asked Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson for a repeat of their week 1 foxtrot because Inaba thought he can win the competition. Part of the challenge was for him to deliver a solo portion in the routine. They danced to \"I Won't Dance\" and impressed the judges enough to earn a score of 38.  Later, Pitbull and Fifth Harmony showed up to perform their new single, \"Por Favor.\"  Judge Len Goodman showed up at Fisher and Lindsay Arnold's rehearsal to coach them on a redemption Charleston. After their explosive number \u2014 in spite of Arnold's bad knee and Fisher's corneal abrasion \u2014 Goodman wanted more traditional moves, but they still got perfect scores from all the judges.  He didn't dance on the ceiling, but new \"American Idol\" judge Lionel Richie showed up to announce Brittany Holmes as the \"golden ticket\" winner who will get a shot at stardom. \"Idol\" will return to television Sunday, March 11, on ABC.  Hough coached Lindsey Stirling on her quickstep. After the performance, Goodman said, \"I know you can play the violin, but there was no fiddling about with that quickstep. Honestly, all the flair. The difficulty with quickstep is to get the speed but maintain the control. And you did that. You used the word \u2014 I'm going to use a word I never use because it's an American word: awesome.\"  Their routine brought them a perfect score.  Scott returned for his freestyle, which Slater said \"is going to be different than everybody else's because you're different from everybody else.\"  Their lively dance earned praise from everyone but Inaba, who said she saw him go out of sync with the team of dancers, ruining his chance at a perfect score. His freestyle earned him his highest score so far, 39.  Muniz and Carson chose a freestyle with dark aspects in spite of a producer's suggestion that Muniz be light. The decision to go out of his comfort zone drew cheers from the audience, and they chanted his name after the routine.  The judges praised the performance and the decision to go dark, but Inaba and Goodman awarded only 9s, while Bruno and Hough gave them 10s, for a 38.  Almost unsurprisingly, Fisher's jazzy freestyle and Stirling's quirky freestyle with Mark Ballas earned both pairs their second perfect scores for the night.  After an exciting evening filled with magnificent performances, the combined viewer votes and judges' scores put Fisher and Stirling into competition for the Mirror Ball. Scott and Muniz were in jeopardy, and it was Muniz who made it to the final night.  Scott showed great sportsmanship with his closing remarks, saying of his partner, \"I mean, there's no way I could have done anything I did out here without her. It's been such a ride. I can't believe I'm here with these guys. Thank you. Thanks to the judges, crew and everybody. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.\"  The second night of finals on \"Dancing With the Stars\" airs today at 8 p.m. on ABC.",

Twitter erupted after controversial cast member Tonya Harding, 47, went onto next week's finale instead of fan favorites figure skater Mirai Nagasu and luger Chris Mazdzer.  Harding, known primarily for her involvement in an attack on fellow Olympian Nancy Kerrigan in 1994, has embarked on a comeback tour this year in the wake of the sympathetic biopic I, Tonya. She dedicated this week's rumba to her deceased father, who she says \"never abandoned me,\" and began to cry almost as soon as she took the dance floor.  \u201cWhen everybody in the world was against me, my dad was still in my corner \u2014 no matter what,\u201d she stated.    The teary performance with partner Sasha Farber merited a 33/40 from the judges, tying with Mazdzer and Witney Carson's foxtrot for the fourth best score of the night. The duo also beat out softball player Jennie Daigle and Keo Motsepe in a cha cha ballroom battle, who later went home as well.  Frontrunner figure skater Adam Rippon and Jenna Johnson's near-perfect 39/40 made them a shoo-in for the finale along with football player Josh Norman and Sharna Burgess, but fans were shocked to learn that Harding had made the cut over Nagasu. Social media quickly bemoaned the selection and questioned the show's results.  Even Harding herself seemed surprised. \"I thought they were going to tell us, 'You're going home,'\" she admitted to reporters backstage after the show. \"I think America has proven that they love me and they wanted to know what happened and now they know. It's really amazing.\"  Amazing for Tonya, but some very vocal Dancing With the Stars fans seem to think otherwise.  ABC has neglected to directly address Harding's backstory on the show, but she pled guilty to hindering the prosecution after ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, and Shane Stant orchestrated an assault against Kerrigan meant to remove her from Olympic consideration. The subsequent scandal led the United States Figure Skating Association to serve Harding a lifetime ban from the sport.  \u201cIt was nice to see that she had a moment,\u201d Rippon told USA Today of Harding's performance last week, \u201cbut it\u2019s also important to remember that skating wasn\u2019t taken away from her \u2013 that she was banned because she was part of a bad thing.\"    Harding, Rippon, and Norman will square off in a one-hour finale on Monday, May 21 at 8 p.m ET on ABC.",

Sasha Pieterse underwent both a personal and physical transformation throughout her journey on Dancing With the Stars.  On Monday\u2019s episode of the reality dance competition series, the Pretty Little Liars star performed her final dance \u2014 a Little Mermaid-themed rumba \u2014 with partner Gleb Savchenko for DWTS\u2018 Disney Night.  \u201cRight now we\u2019re kind of in the middle of the pack. It really scares me because everyone is so good,\u201d Pieterse, 21, said a video package during rehearsals.  Since joining season 25 of the reality series, Pieterse shared in September that she was down 15 lbs. \u2014 and leading up to Monday\u2019s performance, she revealed to viewers that she had lost even more weight.  \u201cWe\u2019re halfway through the competition and I\u2019ve lost 37 lbs. It really is magical,\u201d said Pieterse, who gained nearly 70 pounds over two years due to a hormone condition called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.  \u201cI\u2019m feeling like me again,\u201d Pieterse previously told viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy road, but being able to focus on getting myself healthy again, and the fact that I\u2019m seeing results, getting better is all I can ask for.\u201d  PEOPLE\u2019s special issue 25 Seasons of \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 is on stands now.  After performing alongside Savchenko, Pieterse, who admittedly \u201cthoroughly enjoyed this week,\u201d received rave reviews from the judges.  \u201cI love the way your body interprets these dances. You\u2019ve got so many beautiful angles,\u201d said Carrie Ann Inaba. \u201cMesmerized \u2014 well done.\u201d  \u201cThat was a well-crafted routine. I thought you had great chemistry together. There was a warmth going on between you,\u201d added head judge Len Goodman.  Pieterse was awarded a 24/30 for her number and said that being a contestant on the show was \u201csomething that I never dreamt of and I\u2019m doing it and I love it and I\u2019m so thankful for this opportunity.\u201d  Despite the positive feedback from Inaba, Goodman and Bruno Tonioli, Pieterse found herself in jeopardy with fellow contestant Frankie Muniz, and was ultimately sent home.  \u201cIt was incredible. I knew that it was going to be amazing, but it totally blew my expectations away. I have had such an incredible time and I love everybody here, so obviously this is a very sad moment for me, but I\u2019m juts so thankful,\u201d Pieterse said after receiving a standing ovation from audiences. \u201cI\u2019ve had an amazing experience and I\u2019m so happy that I got to share my story.\u201d  Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.",

Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here.)  Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, \"I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!\" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. \"It's just so special with Bindi,\" he told reporters backstage. \"She's a champion of life.\"  Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks \"to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!\"  The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. \"There's not a thing I would change about this season,\" he told Glamour post-show. \"There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.\"",

I really thought \u201cEl Tango Roxanne\u201d was perfect for Halloween night. It\u2019s creepy and intense. I wanted us to be a character, not dead zombies or something. So, I thought Mrs. and Mr. Frankenstein would be awesome and Joe would pull it off.He danced so great; this was by far Joe\u2019s best dance. I was so happy for him, especially since the judges were very complimentary, and he just had an epic performance. I think this was great for his confidence going into the next week for Country Week. We didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush. We did a pure Argentine tango, he remembered the steps and executed them really well.  Everyone\u2019s journey is so different on this show and sometimes it takes people seven weeks to get good, sometimes it takes people one week. I think Joe is realizing he\u2019s doing well and understanding this process.  Related: 'Dancing With the Stars' Winners Through the Years See pictures of every Dancing With the Stars winner through the years, from Kelly Monaco in season one to Meryl Davis in season 18  During the last five seconds of the dance, Joe grabbed my hips in a bit of a wrong position. It was correct, but it wasn\u2019t all the way around my waist and I knew that if I flipped over, I was probably going to die. I just was like, it\u2019s Halloween night and I have to take one for the team, so I just went for it. I borderline broke my back, but I feel great. Somehow, we landed it, and I think it just made it more surprising and shocking. Sometimes, mistakes are beautiful perfections. If something goes wrong on live TV and someone\u2019s not used to performing or isn\u2019t a dancer, it\u2019s really hard to come back from that. So the fact that he kept going and was still in character and then ripped my head off at the end, I was like, \u2018What? Who is this guy? Not Joe week one! He\u2019s a dancer!\u2019  Next week is Country Week. I didn\u2019t grow up with country music, but I appreciate the lyrics. Usually it\u2019s love songs or some beautiful storytelling. I think it\u2019ll be great for the show because Dancing With the Stars is all about storytelling. We\u2019ve never done a country week before, so it\u2019ll be a first for all of us. Joe and I have something fun planned. I\u2019m gonna go for Coachella vibes \u2026 or should I stay Stagecoach vibes?

Oct 5, 2017  AceShowbiz - You may not see kids among \"America's Got Talent\" contestants in next year's season. The show's judge as well as executive producer Simon Cowell reportedly is considering to ban kids from the NBC show.  Naughty Gossip reveals that Simon is worried that \"America's Got Talent\" is turning into a kiddie's talent show, and the fact that this year's winner is 12-year-old singing ventriloquist Darci Lynne is not helping either. \"This year the two finalists were children. Last year's winner [Grace VanderWaal] was a kid too. The fear is that next year no one older than 15 will even bother auditioning,\" the source says.  \"The most talented adult in America doesn't stand a chance against a child with a homemade puppet. Now Simon is stepping in to fix the problem,\" the source continues. \"It doesn't take anything away from the folks that have already won, but next season is going to be very different with new rules.\"  It remains to be seen how exactly the new season will be different. Previously, Simon said that what he loved about \"America's Got Talent\" is that there were no age limit. \"There are no rules. I applaud the fact that you have paid your dues. You have such a great heart, such a great talent, this has been amazing yet again,\" said the British producer while gushing over season 12 contestant, a subway singer Mike Yung.  Season 12 of the show announced Darci as the winner . 10-singer-old singer Angelica Hale came out as the runner-up while Ukrainian dance troupe Light Balance took the third place. \"I felt so loved during my 'AGT' journey by all the contestants, and all the staff, my friends and family, and everyone\u2026and it just all came out!\" Darci said after bringing home $1 million dollar. \"They made me feel so good that they made me come on the stage. I was overcome with joy, and I was kind of shocked and delirious at that time, so I can't remember anything.\"  You can share this post!",

Tina Fey\u2019s musical opened on Broadway Sunday night, in a high-budget but watered-down adaptation of her wonderfully nasty, 2004 hit comedy. This is \u201cMean Girls\u201d lite.  Directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, the musical starts on a high note, with stage-wall projections of the infamous Burn Book\u2019s slams \u2014 \u201cI suck in all ways,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t contour for s - - t.\u201d A likably daffy Erika Henningsen gets out from under the long shadow cast by the teenage Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, transported from the Kenyan savannah, where she was homeschooled, to suburban Chicago.  Once there, she\u2019s thrown into a different wild kingdom \u2014 high school, where a clique known as the Plastics reigns supreme. Narrating the action is the outsider duo of Janis (Barrett Wilbert Weed, who makes an excellently sardonic Goth girl) and the \u201calmost too gay to function\u201d Damian (a droll Grey Henson), who befriend Cady and goad her into going undercover to undo the Plastics\u2019 queen bee.  Here\u2019s the thing: As off-Broadway\u2019s \u201cHeathers\u201d proved, it\u2019s tough to transfer a big-screen bitch onto the stage. As Regina George, Taylor Louderman can really belt, stomping around on a cafeteria table in tight white denim announcing she\u2019s a \u201cmassive deal.\u201d But she comes across as less cruel nightmare, more future reality-show star. As her wingwomen, Ashley Park\u2019s Gretchen Wieners is a fluttery mass of insecurity, while Kate Rockwell\u2019s Karen Smith is still dumb as rocks but not as overtly laughable; here, thanks to Fey\u2019s updated book about the hazards of social media, Karen\u2019s a sexting victim.  \u201cMean Girls\u201d fans will love hearing their favorite lines, from \u201cOn Wednesdays we wear pink\u201d to \u201cStop trying to make \u2018Fetch\u2019 happen!\u201d and \u201cYou go, Glen Coco!\u201d To their credit, Fey, her composer-husband Jeff Richmond and lyricist Nell Benjamin have resisted crafting these into shameless musical numbers (though I\u2019d have liked to see Coco get his moment in the spotlight). But many of the songs feel like padding, including an uninspired ballad (\u201cMore Is Better\u201d) between Cady and her love interest, Aaron (Kyle Selig).  \u201cMean Girls\u201d the musical is best when it breaks from the movie. Damian amps up the energy in the room with a tap-dancing ode to the perils of smartphone addiction (\u201cStop\u201d), and another song, \u201cApex Predator,\u201d links Cady\u2019s zoologist past to the primal rites of high school.  In this post-\u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d world, some of Fey\u2019s script changes are for the better. The film\u2019s racially branded social groups are exchanged for monikers like \u201cWoke Seniors,\u201d and there are far fewer mentions of \u201csluts\u201d and \u201cwhores.\u201d Fey still finds her way to the core of the story.  \u201cCalling someone ugly doesn\u2019t make you better looking,\u201d says math teacher Ms. Norbury (Kerry Butler, doing a credible Fey imitation). \u201cWe have to stop beating each other up over every little thing, \u2019cause meanwhile men are running around grabbing butts and shooting everybody!\u201d  But let\u2019s be real: Fey is at her funniest when she\u2019s brutally cutting, and songs like Getchen\u2019s lament, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With Me?,\u201d and Karen\u2019s PG-rated ode to racy Halloween costumes (\u201cSexy\u201d) fall far short of the so-real-it\u2019s-painful zingers from her film.  Fey\u2019s show has heart, but it\u2019s not terribly fetch.",

WATCH: Maksim Chmerkovskiy & Peta Murgatroyd Gush Over Their 'Happy' First Date Night Since Son's Birth  \"Maks and I were so careful, but one night we weren't,\" she explains. \"Days later I had this massive hot flash and I thought, 'I better take a test.' So I did. 'What?! How?!' A tear went down my cheek, because I didn't know what to do. I was thinking, 'Do I go to work? Do I call 100 people?'\"  \"I called Maks, who was in Vegas, and said, 'Well, I'm pregnant.' He thought I was kidding,\" she continues. \"When I told him I wasn't, he said, 'Wow, that's good, babe,' in kind of a monotone. It was really weird! He added, 'I'm in a car full of people. I love you so much. I'll call you back.' He did a few minutes later and he was absolutely thrilled and came straight home to celebrate.\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  While pregnant, Murgatroyd continued to dance (that's her profession, after all!), but admits it wasn't fun -- especially with nausea. She remembers feeling extremely fatigued while rehearsing for season 22 of DWTS with Nyle DiMarco.  \"I'd literally fall asleep on the couch in the studio while I was supposed to be teaching Nyle,\" she recalls. \"Eventually Nyle said, 'I know your secret.' He'd figured it out, because my boobs had grown and Maks was bringing me food every day. But Nyle and I won the season with me eight weeks pregnant!\"  WATCH: 'Dancing With the Stars' Week 8 Dance Recap: Best Lifts, Kicks, Tricks and Flips!  The 30-year-old dancer confesses she also wasn't a fan of the weight gain, but remained active throughout her pregnancy.  \"I gained about 40 pounds. My thighs got bigger. My boobs got bigger. My butt got ten times bigger,\" she remembers. \"I kept exercising -- light weights, walking on an incline on the treadmill and Pilates. Keeping up my core strength helped me push during the delivery.\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  \"Hormones mess with your emotions,\" she adds. \"During pregnancy, little things would set me off. I burst into tears because I thought the baby's going-home outfit wasn't the right color. Also, usually I'm obsessed with gourmet cheese. Maks came home with a bag full of it. He was being sweet, but I said, 'I'll puke if you make me eat that.' Instead I went through a pasta phase, eating it with oil and salt at six in the morning.\"  But all of those things no longer mattered when baby Shai finally arrived at 5:34 a.m. on Jan. 4, 2017, weighing in at 7 pounds 11 ounces.  \"Half the time Maks and I were laughing, half the time we were staring at the monitor. Sometime during the night, my water broke. I pushed for 30 minutes and he was here!\" she says. \"Suddenly my baby was on my chest. Maks and I were in shock for the first 30 seconds. Then Maks started to cry, and then I did too. Shai looked at me, took his first breath and just made a little noise. It was the best day of my life.\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  WATCH: Peta Murgatroyd Pumps Breastmilk Before \u2018DWTS\u2019: \u2018My Milkshakes Do Not Bring All the Boys to the Yard\u2019  Shortly after welcoming little Shai into the world, the Auckland, New Zealand, native was already thinking about whether she'd return to work and commit to DWTS' current 24th season. She ultimately said yes, and was paired with Bachelor star Nick Viall. The two were sent home during week seven of the competition.  \"I got the call to come back on the show right after Shai was born. I said yes, but after I hung up, I said to Maks, 'I don't think I can do this,'\" she recalls. \"He reassured me. I returned with new agreements -- there'd be a limit to my hours. Even so, much of the time when I [went] to work, I [had] tears in my eyes. Shai gives me this beautiful smile, and all I want to do is stay home for an extra hour. Then I think, 'The sooner I go, the sooner I can get back.' After work, I hurry home.\"  \"When I returned to work I still had 20 to 25 extra pounds on me,\" she continues. \"It was tough. But now, even with ten pounds to go, I feel good. I want to show women you should be proud of where you are. Don't always look into the future, or you'll miss the now. That said, I'd love to have my pre-baby boobs back by my wedding day!\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  ET recently caught up with Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy at the 24th Annual Race to Erase MS Gala in Los Angeles, where they opened up about how parenting has been going thus far.

        "generated_text": "Dancing With the Stars star Peta Murgatroyd recently spoke with Fit Pregnancy and Baby about her pregnancy, giving birth to her son Shai, and returning to the show just two months after giving birth. Murgatroyd, who is engaged to Maksim Chmerkovskiy, candidly discussed the moment she found out she was pregnant, her difficult pregnancy, and the joy of becoming a mother.\n\nMurgatroyd explained that she and Chmerkovskiy were \"so careful,\" but one night they weren't. Days later, she experienced a hot flash and decided to take a pregnancy test. To her surprise, it came back positive. She immediately called Chmerkovskiy, who was in Las Vegas at the time, and told him the news. At first, he didn't believe her, but when he realized she was serious, he was thrilled.\n\nThroughout her pregnancy, Murgatroyd continued to dance, but admits it wasn't fun. She was extremely tired and nauseous, and often fell asleep during rehearsals. However, she remained active throughout her pregnancy, doing light weights, walking on an incline on the treadmill, and Pilates to keep her core strength up.\n\nAfter giving birth to Shai on January 4, 2017, Murgatroyd was unsure if she would return to Dancing With the Stars' current season. She ultimately decided to give it another try, but with new agreements that would limit her hours. Despite the challenges of balancing motherhood and the show, Murgatroyd feels grateful for the opportunity to dance again and hopes to inspire other mothers to be proud of where they are.\n\nET recently caught up with Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy at the 24th Annual Race to Erase MS Gala in Los Angeles, where they opened up about how parenting has been going thus far. The event marked the adorable duo's first official \"date night\" since Shai's arrival. Murgatroyd admitted that parenting has changed her whole life and world, but also revealed that nothing is more beautiful than seeing Chmerkovskiy fall in love with their child every day.",

        "doc_1_text": "Fans of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars may have thought they had seen the last of the eliminated queens. However, Ru is always full of surprises and his biggest twist yet happened in the season finale. He brought back the eliminated queens who determined the top two for the season. Because of their decision, Trixie Mattel won Drag Race All Stars 3, and pretty much no one saw it coming. The eliminated queens returning to Drag Race changed everything, because for the first time in the series\u2019 herstory, they had the real power.  In previous seasons of All Stars, Ru had made determinations of who the top queens would be through their performances in various challenges. This season, that changed. The eliminated queens were back as a \u201cJury of Queer Peers\u201d in Ru\u2019s words. They acted in similar roles to other iconic reality TV shows that maintain a jury pool, like Survivor or Big Brother.  In the end, the top two queens the jury chose were Trixie Mattel and Kennedy Davenport. Then it was between them to see who could win the crown.  This was a much more exciting returning twist than the first time the eliminated queens came back to the competition in Episode 7. Then, it could have given a returning queen the boost to ride and potentially win the competition. However, it ended up being rather anticlimactic. That is because the queen who returned, Morgan McMichaels, was sent back home the week after she\u2019d returned. This second return of the queens was so much more dramatic, though.  Their decision brought up a central question for viewers: What does it mean to be the winning Drag Race Queen? This twist mattered so much because it is what fundamentally changed the competition and its future. In the past, it has been clear that the queen who was most successful throughout the competition deserved to be crowned queen. All Stars 3 was different.  The eliminated queens determined the top two based on who they felt needed the title and money the most. They chose to reward the queens that they felt needed a bigger platform or wouldn\u2019t be as successful on their own without the win. It really was a backhanded compliment when the eliminated queens picked Kennedy and Trixie as the top two. The most successful and deserving queens in the competition were barred from competing, in that sense.  Of course, that meant that Shangela was not going to even get a shot at the crown. She has one of, if not the largest fanbase of any of the queens this season and ended up winning tens of thousands of dollars throughout the competition. It was clear that Shangela had been the front-runner \u2014 however, her success outside this competition clearly kept her from being considered for the top two.  Shangela had won more challenges than anyone and she had never lost a lip-sync. She had proven throughout the competition that if it wasn\u2019t BenDeLaCreme who would win, the crown should most logically be hers. Despite that, she wasn\u2019t allowed to lip-sync for her legacy in the end.  But Shangela was not the only one who was robbed of an opportunity. While BeBe had clearly made some enemies with her demeanor throughout the show, she had been consistently one of the best after Shangela. However, it was obvious that the eliminated queens didn't want BeBe to potentially win two crowns. Again, in their view, she didn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d the win.  More than in any previous season of Drag Race, the eliminated queens of All Stars 3 truly mattered. Despite BenDeLaCreme and Shangela absolutely dominating the competition, it was not to be that either of them would wear the crown. Finally, it was the eliminated queens' decision that allowed Trixie to win the crown. While some, (perhaps rightfully) think that twist was unfair or out of place, the season is now over. Ultimately, it is RuPaul\u2019s drag world, and we\u2019re all just living in it.",

We hear ABC is actively in talks to land Caitlyn Jenner for the 26th season, which will feature just 10 athletes for an unusually short four-week season.  If the 68-year-old Olympic gold medalist signs on the dotted line, she\u2019ll be the third member of her family to slip on their dancing shoes for cameras.  Stepdaughter Kim Kardashian competed in the seventh season and placed 11th in the competition. Rob Kardashian competed in the 13th season and became the first runner-up.

But, being the competitor that she is, Lindsey bravely still appeared on the Monday, Oct. 30 Halloween episode despite being in pain.  And just a few days after her brave performances with pro partner Mark Ballas, Lindsey gave worried fans an update on her condition. \u201cThank you so much for all your prayers. I don\u2019t know how I made it through this dance. It really was a miracle. Not only was I injured and in a lot of pain but the hardest part to get through was that my spirit was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought that I might have to forfeit, and the thought that this injury might effect my tour was devastating. For the first time in a while, I didn\u2019t believe that I could do it.\u201d  She added, \u201cI received help from Drs (@humangaragela), I got a blessing from a church leader, I prayed, and I visualized what I couldn\u2019t practice. I basically forced myself to believe I could make it through that dance. Sometimes you have to fake it till you make it.\u201d Luckily, it seems Lindsey and Mark will also appear on tonight\u2019s DWTS episode! \u201cThis week, I am being very careful with how I pace my body and I\u2019m feeling a little stronger every day. I\u2019ve reminded myself why I do what I do and I have my fire back. I believe I can do this and it\u2019s real now. Thank you so much for your support. You guys believe in me even when I doubt myself. Please keep me in your prayers,\u201d Lindsey concluded.  Mark also gave fans an update Lindsey\u2019s condition last week. \u201cI am not going to lie \u2014 she is in a bit of pain,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cWe are blessed that the X-ray didn\u2019t show any break or fracture. But definitely some muscle issues in there and she has to rest now, ice it, [and] take care of herself.\u201d  \u201cIf I have to bench her a bit this week, we will, but the fact that she got out there tonight was super-impressive,\u201d Mark continued. \u201cAll day she was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to let down the fans, I don\u2019t want to let anybody down, I don\u2019t want to let down my team. I want to go out there and do it.\u2019 I was really impressed \u2014 that was a hard routine to do with a back injury.\u201d  Mark, 31, traveled with Lindsey, also 31, to a local hospital after the professional violinist was badly hurt while practicing a \u201crapid dance move\u201d in late October. In the pre-dance segment before their performance last week, Lindsey was seen asking Mark what will happen if she couldn\u2019t perform on the Halloween DWTS episode while breaking down in tears.  \u201cThis is definitely not an ideal day for this to happen, it\u2019s never an ideal day to have an injury. But today is Sunday, it\u2019s the day before we perform\u2026 so this is kind of really nerve-wracking,\u201d Mark said. Lindsey then stated, \u201cI push, push, push all the time\u2026 that\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten to where I\u2019m at but I\u2019m just so afraid that I might\u2019ve pushed too far.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m going to be so mad if I\u2019ve blown it, we\u2019ve worked so hard\u2026 What happens if they say I can\u2019t go out there tomorrow?\u201d Lindsey asked to which Mark replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll be forced to forfeit\u2026 that\u2019ll be it.\u201d As per the show\u2019s official rules, a celebrity contestant must compete each week to be eligible for the Mirror Ball Trophy. However, pro dancers may skip an episode due to injury or other circumstances and are then replaced by backup pros or troupe dancers.  After their high-energy performance last week, the judges (yet again) praised the two for their successful pasadoble. The couple then received 9\u2019s across the board from Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, and Bruno Tonioli, which was three points off from their perfect score the week prior. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but it is all mindset, unless you are just so done that there is no coming back, which I have been in that situation before as well,\u201d Mark shared. \u201cBut the great thing about this show is that we have incredible fans that keep us going. Lindsey wanted to get out there for them and this was so important to her. She is working so hard and she\u2019s got a shot at this. I just want to make sure she is taking care of her body.\u201d  And with just a few weeks left before the Mirror Ball Trophy is awarded, Mark and Lindsey are really in it to win it! \u201cWe keep trying to be creative, we keep pushing the boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cLindsey and I have a great time together. Our chemistry is so fun in rehearsals, we laugh a lot, we\u2019ve just got to make sure that she is healthy now and just keep pushing the envelope and entertaining the fans.\u201d We\u2019re so proud of Lindsey for being such a fighter \u2014 and we can\u2019t wait to see what the couple comes out with tonight!",

Baby Bella Raises Profile of WWE's Reality TV Portfolio  In its Q4 2016 earnings report, WWE singled out the Bella Twins YouTube channel and Total Bellas as highlights of its growing presence in digital media and reality television, respectably. On the strength of reality shows like Total Bellas, WWE was able to increase its television revenues by 23 percent, compared to Q4 2015, with revenues of $68.6 million.  With the first Bella baby now conceived, Nikki Bella, Brie Bella, John Cena and Daniel Bryan stand to reap the benefits of surging interest in their monetized post-WWE lives.  Credit: WWE.com  Birdie Joe Playlist will Attract Millions of Viewers on YouTube  Special events have translated to large viewership numbers on the Bella Twins YouTube channel. All four of the aforementioned stars are either retired or part-time performers. The Bella Twins YouTube channel has allowed fans continued access to their lives while they spend time away from the world wide leader and its famed squared circle.  When the channel surpassed 500,000 subscribers, John Cena and Nikki Bella engaged in a playful striptease to the tune of over seven million views and counting. As of this writing, the channel has since surpassed to over 630,000 subscribers.  As part of the Bella Twins YouTube channel, Cena and Nikki Bella have launched the \"Our Wedding\" playlist, documenting the pending nuptials between the power couple following Cena's high-profile proposal at WrestleMania 33. With just nine videos, the playlist is closing in on nine million views as it has averaged just under one million views per video.  Brie Bella and Daniel Bryan figure to reap similar benefits for all things Birdie Danielson, as videos of the new parents will to spark comparable interest.  Baby Bella Translates to E! Network Ratings Bonanza  Should the long-awaited birth make its way to either Total Divas or Total Bellas, both of which air on the E! Network, the Bella Empire stands to have quite the ratings coup with both a wedding special and a child birth episode occurring in the same season.  In Keeping up with the Kardashians, the episode All Signs Point to North featured footage of Kim Kardashian going into labor. The episode, which occurred in Season 11, drew an impressive 2.28 million viewers. And while a show like Total Bellas may not see a similar pop in viewership\u2014the inaugural season averaged just over 640,000 viewers\u2014it can certainly expect to grow its viewership in the likelihood that it continues to broadcast such intriguing life events.",

The breakup has \u201cbeen hard for Channing,\u201d a source close to the couple, both 37, tells PEOPLE. \u201cHe always had Jenna and their family to go home to, so having their separation be \u2018official\u2019 now has been a big adjustment for him.\u201d  As for Dewan, a second source says, \u201cJenna has a super-packed schedule and a ton of girlfriends to lean on and spend time with. Her life isn\u2019t really changing \u2026 if anything, she\u2019s just busier.\u201d  Both Dewan and Tatum have been spotted out and about without their wedding rings since jointly announcing their split on April 2. Days after news of their breakup was made public, Dewan went back to shooting her upcoming TV show Mixtape.  This past weekend, Tatum stepped out for the Honda Indy Grand Prix on Sunday, attending his first public event since he and Dewan announced their split. The 37-year-old actor attended the event in Birmingham, Alabama, where he served as the grand marshal and hung out with Bachelor star Arie Luyendyk Jr.  Meanwhile, Dewan has also slowly been returning to social media \u2014 and removed her married last name from her accounts (Tatum has yet to share anything new on social media).  Ethan Miller/Getty  Last week, she updated Instagram with her first post since her separation, writing, \u201cThank you guys for all your love. Love you right back.\u201d  On Wednesday, Dewan posted her first YouTube video since the split \u2014 dancing to Henry Green\u2019s song \u201cSomething\u201d in a white dress on the beach. The video, titled A Little Dance, was \u201cinspired by this cove, this song, and voila! Love love love xx,\u201d Dewan wrote in the description.  Another source close to Dewan says, \u201cJenna is great. She seems very energetic and excited about her life. It was very difficult for her to announce the separation. She didn\u2019t want it to happen for a long time.  In a statement to PEOPLE, Dewan and Tatum announced they were going their separate ways.  \u201cWe have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple,\u201d the pair said, later sharing the same statement on their Twitter and Instagram pages. \u201cThere are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision \u2014 just two best-friends realizing it\u2019s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.\u201d  Dewan and Tatum first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up and tied the knot in 2009. Both share daughter Everly, who will turn 5 in May.  A source close to the couple previously told PEOPLE the pair tried to make things work after \u201cgrowing apart\u201d over the past year.  \u201cThey really wanted to make their marriage work,\u201d said the insider. \u201cBut neither of them are people who will stay in something that isn\u2019t fully right.\u201d",

        "doc_2_text": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan officially announced their split on Monday night after months of speculation that the couple was heading for a divorce. Fans were stunned to hear the news that the pair had decided to end their nine-year marriage and couldn\u2019t help but wonder what caused the sad breakup.  According to an April 3 report by Radar Online, there were many factors that led to the end of Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan\u2019s marriage. The first is likely the fact that Tatum wanted to have more children. The actor and his estranged wife are the parents of one daughter, Everly, but it seems that the Magic Mike star wanted a bigger family, which is something that Dewan didn\u2019t seem to be on board with. A past report by OK! Magazine claims that Jenna wanted to get back into acting and that caring for a newborn would derail those plans.  The baby battle allegedly continued for Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan when the actress got tired of being a housewife while her husband spent his time on movie sets. A source revealed that Tatum made more than enough money to support the family and that he wanted Dewan at home with little Everly so she would not be raised by nannies.  The jealousy allegedly began to rise in Jenna Dewan as Channing Tatum hit new levels of success with movies like 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and their sequels. The pair met on the set of the film Step Up as equals in their careers, but Channing\u2019s celebrity surpassed Jenna\u2019s over the years. However, that wasn\u2019t all Jenna was reportedly jealous of.  Channing Tatum has become a sex symbol in Hollywood, and women flock to him wherever he goes. The actor will often create a gaggle of girls and women around him, and sources claim that Jenna Dewan hated the way her husband flirted with fans in front of her. Although many fans deemed the pair as the perfect couple, Dewan told the media earlier this year that they are far from perfect and \u201cfight\u201d just like any other couple would.  Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan released an official statement on their split via social media and revealed they would make no further comments on the end of their marriage going forward.",

This caused tension in their relationship, as Tatum wanted Dewan to be a stay-at-home mom so that Everly would not be raised by nannies. However, Dewan was not comfortable with this arrangement.\n\nThe couple's jealousy of each other also reportedly played a role in their breakup.

Make-up artist Vinny Ohh, 25, asked Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif to construct him a nose that was truly out of this world when he first appeared on Botched in 2016, but the doctors refused to deform him.  Vinny has returned to the E! reality series to help guide his friend Bryan Ray, 32, who is looking to get his 'perfect nose' for his 'dream wedding.'  Scroll down for video  Two of a kind: Vinny Ohh (L), who has spent $50,000 transforming himself into an alien, gives Britney Spears impersonator Bryan Ray (R) plastic surgery advice on Wednesday's Botched  Returning: Vinny first appeared on the Botched in 2016, but Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul refused to construct the out of this world nose he was asking for  'Me and Bryan have a lot in common in terms of him being Britney and me being an alien. We're both striving for a different picture,' Vinny explains in a preview clip for Wednesday night's episode.  When he first appeared on the show, he wanted the doctors to create him a nose that starts out thick from the nasal bridge and comes down to a point. However, they warned him that what he wanted to achieve was potentially dangerous and wouldn't actually work.  The surgeons advised him to stick with a more natural-looking nose, and Vinny appreciated their honesty.  'They will definitely say that I have taken more of an extraterrestrial on Earth kind of look \u2014 but always being galaxy realness,' he tells the cameras.  After watching Bryan rehearse, they sit down for a chat and Bryan reveals that he and his fianc\u00e9 have set a wedding date, but he's looking to have another surgery before saying 'I do.'  Friends: 'Me and Bryan have a lot in common in terms of him being Britney and me being an alien. We're both striving for a different picture,' Vinny says  Britney lover: Bryan says he wants to get a second nose job before his wedding  Highly recommended: Vinny (pictured with Bryan's fianc\u00e9) assures Bryan that he is in good hands with Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif  The right time: 'Now is the perfect time that I get my perfect nose for my dream wedding,' Bryan explains in another clip  'You know my nose has been bothering me, so I am going to Dr.Dubrow and Dr. Nassif,' he tells Vinny. 'I want the bridge more defined. I want it sharper.'  Bryan's fianc\u00e9 cuts in to remind him that he has already had a rhinoplasty, but Vinny gets where he is coming from.  'I've had my nose worked on about five times, so you know I got you,' he tells Bryan, who adds: 'You have to do it until it feels right for you.'  'You are in such good hands,' Vinny adds. 'I never had doctors be so honest with me about my transition to become an alien.  'They pushed me away but girl I have faith. And they're cute. They are kind of cute, like Dubrow? Yeah, I feel it.'  Checking it out: Dr. Nassif (L) and Dr. Dubrow (R) aren't sure they can help Bryan  Demands: 'I want the bridge more defined. I want it sharper,' Bryan says of his nose  Yikes: Dr. Nassif warns Bryan that part his nose will collapse if he has another rhinoplasty  Upset: The Britney fan looks distraught when he hears the news from Dr. Nassif  Vinny also notes that since he last appeared on the show, he's had his cheeks, brown bone, and lips done, 'you know, the normal alien maintenance.'  He has had more than 110 procedures to transform into a 'genderless' extra-terrestrial. The make-up artist believes he's neither male nor female and so his extreme look is a way to mirror how he feels inside.  Vinny started getting cosmetic procedures after feeling like an outcast while growing up. He got lip fillers at the age of 17, before having two rhinoplasties, multiple cheeks and brow bone fillers, and more.  The part-time model also wears large blackened contact lenses, alien like talons, and dyes his hair bright colors.  Last year he revealed he plant to fork out another $160,000 to have his genitalia, nipples and bellybutton removed.  Dedicated: Bryan has spent more than $80,000 on plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures to look like Britney Spears  Throwback: Bryan started emulating the 'Hit Me Baby, One More Time' singing superstar at 17  All smiles: Bryan pictured with the singer when they met for the first time on vacation in Hawaii  'I want to be a sexless alien being, I want my outside to reflect how I feel on the inside,' he said. 'The overall image I want to do is an alien. I want to be a hybrid, not male or female.  'I've wanted to be sexless and genderless since I was 17, I've been going to doctors to see if it's possible but had no luck.  'I don't want people to think I'm trying to change into a woman,' he added. 'I could live without sexual organs so why should I have a penis or a vagina? I don't see why I shouldn't have my genitals completely removed and have nothing down there.'  It's unclear if Vinny ended up going through with the procedure.  Like Vinny, Bryan has also spent thousands of dollars on plastic surgery, shilling out more than $80,000 to look like his idol Britney Spears.  Transformation: He's had more than 90 cosmetic procedures including a nose job, having fat injected into his cheeks, laser hair removal, lip fillers, Botox injections, and more  Dedicated: Bryan also splashes out $500 a month on lotions to keep his skin looking youthful  Bryan started emulating the 'Hit Me Baby, One More Time' singing superstar at 17, when he had veneers to match her smile.  Since then he's had more than 90 cosmetic procedures including a nose job, having fat injected into his cheeks, laser hair removal, lip fillers, Botox injections, and more.  As well as cosmetic procedures, he splashes out $500 a month on lotions to keep his skin looking youthful.  On Wednesday night's episode of Botched, he is looking to get his second rhinoplasty, explaining: 'Now is the perfect time that I get my perfect nose for my dream wedding.'  However, its unclear if the doctors will be willing to operate on him.  'Here is the issue, part of your nose will just go psst and collapse in,' Dr. Nassif tells Bryan in another preview clip from the episode.",

In a preview clip from Thursday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Dr. Terry Dubrow warns his patient Shannon that it is a high-risk procedure because she doesn't have a great deal of blood supply coming into her nipples.  Although he has yet to lose a nipple over the course of his career, the surgeon admits that it's a possibility if Shannon decides to go under the knife again.  Scroll down for video  Looking for help: Shannon asks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif to fix her misshapen 'zombie boobs' on Thursday's episode of the E! reality series Botched  Yikes: The patient was left with deformed breasts after a failed fat transfer  'So, this is old. This is dead fat. So, all that fat transfer did was die,' Dr. Dubrow tells Shannon as he examines her breasts.  'For a fat transfer to the breast to work, the fat has to be good and the tissue you're transferring it to has to have good blood supply,' he explains during his confessional.  'In Shannon's case, that is absolutely not going to work, and, in my opinion, is a very weak solution.'  After nixing the possibility of a second fat-transfer surgery, Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts.  The surgeon's complicated approach includes reconstruction and a new pair of implants.  'The breast tissue loss that you have from the original operation means the blood supply coming into the nipple is not that robust, he says. 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this.  No can do: Dr. Dubrow tells her that her breast is filled with 'dead fat,' explaining that a second fat transfer was out of the question  Complicated: Dr. Dubrow gives Shannon a rundown of the multi-step procedure she will have to undergo to fix her breasts, including reconstruction and new breast implants  'Have I ever lost a nipple? No. You want to be my first?' he asks Shannon, who shakes her head in response.  During her confessional, Shannon admits she is terrified because she would like to be able to breastfeed her children one day.  Dr. Dubrow also makes it clear that she won't have any control over what breast implants he decides to give her if she goes along with the surgery.  'I know what your goal is. You want to be filled out so when you're in clothes it looks like you've got breasts. You want a breast implant look, meaning you want a breast augmentation,' he says.  'But in terms of size, if you want me to do your surgery \u2014 I rarely say this to patients \u2014 it's up to me what size we use. That's my call, and if that's not acceptable, that's a deal breaker. It's up to me.'  Dr. Dubrow tells the camera that he needs Shannon to 'temper expectations' because she won't be getting her exact dream results if she has the surgery.  Complications: Dr. Dubrow explains that Shannon doesn't have a robust blood supply coming into the nipples because of the breast tissue loss she has from her original surgery  Say what? 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this,' he tells her  'It's scary,' says Shannon, and Dr. Dubrow agrees, telling her: 'It is scary. This is big-time, hi-risk surgery.'  However, Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks.  'The good news is you're now in someone's hands that is very good at this,' he says. 'There's a great chance of your breasts looking a lot better than you having a problem with your nipples.'  In another preview clip from the episode, Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif meet with Michelle, a woman who was left scarring on her chin after a botched surgery.  'I went into the doctor. He looked at my chin area and there was a double chin and some loose skin, so he said that I should put in an implant, and I should get some liposuction around my face and stuff,' she explains during her consultation.  Michelle agreed to the procedure, explaining that her original doctor was a 'board certified plastic surgeon.'  'Two days after he took the bandage off to see, and immediately there was a little lump here [on the right side of her chin]. And then there was a ball here [on the left side], and he said that was scar tissue and this [on the bottom right side of her chin], he wasn\u2019t sure what this was,' she says.  Weighing her options: Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks  Struggle: Shannon has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her breasts  Dr. Dubrow stresses it's impossible to develop scar tissue in just a couple of days.  'Scar tissue does not form that quickly after surgery,' he tells the camera. 'If Michelle had a wound problem, it was because the surgical procedure reduced the blood supply to the overlying soft tissue and caused the tissue to die.'  The doctor ended up leaving Michelle with an even bigger scar on her face when he attempted to cut out the 'scar tissue.'  'He cut on the outside of your neck?' asks a stunned Dr. Nassif.  'This was the wrong procedure, the wrong approach, the wrong everything, to do to Michelle,' he says during his confessional. 'You don\u2019t put scars in the outside of the face.'  Michelle goes on to say that her botched surgery isn't even the worst part of her shocking story.  'On my last post-op, my appointment was really early in the morning, and I was waiting in the parking lot in the back, and there\u2019s this mini-van that pulls up right next to me. This guy opens the door, falls out, crawls over, and starts pulling on my door handle, and I noticed that it\u2019s my doctor,' she recalls.  Consultation: During the episode, Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif also meet with Michelle, a woman who was left scarring on her chin after a botched surgery  Nightmare: Michelle was left with lumps on her face after a botched chin surgery. She was left with an even bigger scar when her original doctor tried to fix his mistake  'Your doctor\u2019s a drug addict,' Dr. Dubrow says bluntly, but the story doesn't end there.  'I rolled the window down, and was like, \"Um, do you need something?\" and he said, \"Let me in.\" And I said, \"Uhh\u2026\" and he said, \"Just come inside, just come inside,\"' she continues.  'He doesn\u2019t have shoes on, his hair is a mess, and we get in the facility, and he said, \"Help me get one of my white jackets.\"'  A baffled Dr. Nassif asks if it was just the two of them alone, and Michelle says it was initially, but then the rest of the staff started coming in.  'He said, \"Never speak a word of this,\" and I said, \"Okay,\"' she recalls.  Dr. Dubrow believes Michelle's doctor abused his position and took advantage of his patient's trust in him.  'The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most sacred relationships in any profession,' he says. 'When a doctor tells you, \"Don\u2019t tell this to anybody,\" you understand, because of the basic power structure between the doctor and the patient, why Michelle didn\u2019t run out the door, screaming.'",

Dr. Dubrow tells the camera that he needs Shannon to 'temper expectations' because she won't be getting her exact dream results if she has the surgery.  Complications: Dr. Dubrow explains that Shannon doesn't have a robust blood supply coming into the nipples because of the breast tissue loss she has from her original surgery  Say what? 'This is a risky procedure. I could lose your nipples with this,' he tells her  'It's scary,' says Shannon, and Dr. Dubrow agrees, telling her: 'It is scary. This is big-time, hi-risk surgery.'  However, Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks.  'The good news is you're now in someone's hands that is very good at this,' he says. 'There's a great chance of your breasts looking a lot better than you having a problem with your nipples.'  In another preview clip from the episode, Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif meet with Michelle, a woman who was left scarring on her chin after a botched surgery.  'I went into the doctor. He looked at my chin area and there was a double chin and some loose skin, so he said that I should put in an implant, and I should get some liposuction around my face and stuff,' she explains during her consultation.  Michelle agreed to the procedure, explaining that her original doctor was a 'board certified plastic surgeon.'  'Two days after he took the bandage off to see, and immediately there was a little lump here [on the right side of her chin]. And then there was a ball here [on the left side], and he said that was scar tissue and this [on the bottom right side of her chin], he wasn\u2019t sure what this was,' she says.  Weighing her options: Dr. Paul Nassif reassures her that Dr. Dubrow is a talented surgeon and the reward will most-likely outweigh the risks  Struggle: Shannon has to decide if she is willing to risk losing her nipples by having a second surgery to fix her breasts  Dr. Dubrow stresses it's impossible to develop scar tissue in just a couple of days.  'Scar tissue does not form that quickly after surgery,' he tells the camera. 'If Michelle had a wound problem, it was because the surgical procedure reduced the blood supply to the overlying soft tissue and caused the tissue to die.'  The doctor ended up leaving Michelle with an even bigger scar on her face when he attempted to cut out the 'scar tissue.'  'He cut on the outside of your neck?' asks a stunned Dr. Nassif.  'This was the wrong procedure, the wrong approach, the wrong everything, to do to Michelle,' he says during his confessional. 'You don\u2019t put scars in the outside of the face.'  Michelle goes on to say that her botched surgery isn't even the worst part of her shocking story.  'On my last post-op, my appointment was really early in the morning, and I was waiting in the parking lot in the back, and there\u2019s this mini-van that pulls up right next to me. This guy opens the door, falls out, crawls over, and starts pulling on my door handle, and I noticed that it\u2019s my doctor,' she recalls.  Consultation: During the episode, Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif also meet with Michelle, a woman who was left scarring on her chin after a botched surgery  Nightmare: Michelle was left with lumps on her face after a botched chin surgery. She was left with an even bigger scar when her original doctor tried to fix his mistake  'Your doctor\u2019s a drug addict,' Dr. Dubrow says bluntly, but the story doesn't end there.  'I rolled the window down, and was like, \"Um, do you need something?\" and he said, \"Let me in.\" And I said, \"Uhh\u2026\" and he said, \"Just come inside, just come inside,\"' she continues.  'He doesn\u2019t have shoes on, his hair is a mess, and we get in the facility, and he said, \"Help me get one of my white jackets.\"'  A baffled Dr. Nassif asks if it was just the two of them alone, and Michelle says it was initially, but then the rest of the staff started coming in.  'He said, \"Never speak a word of this,\" and I said, \"Okay,\"' she recalls.  Dr. Dubrow believes Michelle's doctor abused his position and took advantage of his patient's trust in him.  'The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most sacred relationships in any profession,' he says. 'When a doctor tells you, \"Don\u2019t tell this to anybody,\" you understand, because of the basic power structure between the doctor and the patient, why Michelle didn\u2019t run out the door, screaming.'",

        "generated_text": "Kim Kardashian is planning to undergo multiple plastic surgeries before the New Year, including procedures on her face, thighs, and boobs, according to an informant. The reality star has previously spoken about her plans to reduce her buttocks, and will likely undergo liposuction on her inner and outer thighs to achieve a thigh gap in time for bikini season in Hawaii. While some may view her obsession with plastic surgery as excessive, the mother-of-two remains committed to her goals.\n\nOn the other hand, a woman named Shannon was left with \"zombie boobs\" after a failed fat transfer surgery. Shannon is considering a second surgery to fix her misshapen breasts, but Dr. Terry Dubrow warns her that it is a high-risk procedure because she doesn't have a great deal of blood supply coming into her nipples. Shannon is terrified because she would like to be able to breastfeed her children one day, but Dr. Dubrow makes it clear that she won't have any control over what breast implants he decides to give her if she goes along with the surgery.\n\nDr. Dubrow also meets with Michelle, a woman who was left with lumps on her face after a botched chin surgery. Michelle's original doctor was a \"board certified plastic surgeon,\" but Michelle ended up with an even bigger scar on her face when her original doctor attempted to fix his mistake. Dr. Dubrow believes Michelle's doctor abused his position and took advantage of her trust in him. The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most sacred relationships in any profession, he says, and Michelle should have run out of the door, screaming.\n\nOverall, it seems that plastic surgery can have serious risks, and patients should carefully consider their options before undergoing any procedures. It's important to choose a qualified and experienced surgeon, and to be fully informed about the risks and benefits of the surgery.",

        "doc_2_text": "Jennifer Aniston Plastic Surgery  Date of Birth: February 11, 1969  February 11, 1969 Rumored Procedures: Rhinoplasty, lip injections, breast augmentation  Jennifer Aniston first made a name for herself in the 1990s starring as the lovable character Rachel on Friends. She quickly became a household name, even donning a signature haircut otherwise known as \"The Rachel.\" Since her rocket to stardom, Aniston has also made headlines for her love life, marrying and subsequently divorcing Hollywood's leading man, Brad Pitt. Following her divorce, rumors have swirled that Aniston has surgically altered her appearance, including a modest breast enhancement and not-so-modest lip injections. While the actress publicly discusses her tough workout regimens, and declares that she is all-natural, one can't help but wonder: has America's sweetheart undergone cosmetic surgery?  Breast Augmentation  While many have speculated that Aniston has undergone breast enhancement, the actress adamantly denies the rumors, even chalking her fuller breasts up to weight gain and a few too many \"cheese boards.\" The rumors were fueled by celebrity magazines that published photos of Aniston's breasts appearing fuller than ever during an appearance on the 2007 People's Choice Awards.  Rhinoplasty  A quick look at a \"then and now\" profile of Aniston leads many people to believe that she has undergone not one, but two rhinoplasty surgeries. In photos taken in the early 90s, Aniston's bridge and nostrils appear much wider than they do today. Aniston admitted to having a deviated septum corrected, but said she was unhappy with the results. In February 2007, Aniston made a second attempt to correct the problem, and was quoted as saying, \"best thing I ever did. I slept like a baby for the first time in years.\"  Lip Injections  In 2008, Aniston was photographed with her lips looking a bit plumper than usual. Many magazines speculated that she received lip injection treatments after she emerged with a significantly larger upper lip. Some celebrity plastic surgeons even weighed in, noting a considerable difference. Luckily, Aniston's enhancement fit well with the rest of her features.  Choosing a Cosmetic Surgeon  Celebrities are no strangers to cosmetic surgery. In an environment where youth is highly prized, it would not be unexpected for Aniston, 40, to opt for cosmetic procedures to maintain her look. In fact the actress has stated that she will never rule out the possibility of receiving cosmetic treatments and supports actions that women take to feel better about their appearance. If Aniston has previously received cosmetic surgery, she has avoided criticism about her looks by choosing skilled plastic surgeons. One of the reasons it is so hard to tell if she underwent surgery is because her results are very natural-looking. This has helped keep her name off of any \"worst\" cosmetic surgery lists. No matter what your desired outcome, it is important to find a skilled professional to perform any kind of cosmetic surgery. Doing so will not only maintain the safety of your health, but it will also produce the natural-looking results that you desire.  Contact a Plastic Surgeon  Procedures such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and lip injections can enhance your overall appearance. If you are interested in learning more about plastic surgery, contact a plastic surgeon in your area to find out if you are a good candidate for treatment.

        "doc_1_text": "Last year she was attacked and bitten by a friend's dog and last part of her face  A woman who lost part of her face when a dog tore chunks out of her lip in a brutal attack has been transformed by TV's Botched surgeons.  Karissa Weckesser, 24, was at a friend's house playing with her dog when it launched at her, prompting her to black out from the pain. When she awoke she was in the emergency room as surgeons prepared to repair the damage to her face.  Physicians attempted to use the flesh that had been torn off, but there was too much tissue damage, and so they took a piece from her lower lip and 'rolled it up' on her upper lip to minimise the space left where the dog had bitten Karissa.  But in last night's episode of Botched, surgeons Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif were able to improve the results by 'shortening' her upper lip.  Karissa was thrilled with the results and said she could 'see my old self again'.  Karissa got her lip corrected after she lost part of her face when she was attacked by a dog  Doctors in the emergency room didn't risk reattaching her flesh because the tissue had died  At first the surgeons were unsure if they would be able to fix her mouth as the emergency room doctors had failed to attach the chunk of flesh she had lost when they originally operated.  Dr Nassif explained to Karissa: 'So what they did was they took a piece of your lower lip and kind of rolled it up to fill that defect.  'Before doing an aggressive procedure like that, we would've maybe just put the tissue together and just see how it heals because it does shorten the sides of your mouth.'  'At this point, I really don't know if I'm going to be able to help Karissa. I just hope that her doctor has not done irreversible damage,' he told the camera.  Surgeons used a part of her lower lip to roll up on her upper lip to fill the wound but left her with a hanging piece of flesh  Karissa was at a friend's house and playing with her dog when the animal launched into an unprovoked attack  Botched surgeons Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif were unsure whether they'd be able to fix the injury  Fortunately they were able to repair her lip by trimming the dropping skin over her mouth.  Karissa, who was left unable to eat properly because of her injury, was thrilled.  She said: 'After a few unsuccessful reconstruction attempts, I had lost all hope that I would ever be able to eat, feel, or look normal ever again.  Karissa blacked out during the attack which is a common way the brain tries to protect itself  Surgeons were able to fix the damage by shortening her lip and fixing it back into place  They said they would have used her flesh during the original operation to see if it would take  'Thanks to Dr. Nassif I can open my mouth more and when I look in the mirror I see my old self.'  The surgeons told Karissa that blacking out during the incident was common during trauma as it is the brain's way of protecting itself, but it meant she couldn't remember what happened to her.  'A year ago this month, I went to my friend's house,' Karissa said. 'We were playing with the dog, you know, hanging out.'  Karissa's (left and right before the attack) injury meant she was unable to eat properly with an extra bit of skin over her lip  She worried that she wouldn't ever feel 'normal' again because of the damage her injury caused  She became emotional in the surgeons' office as she revealed the impact of her injury  She continued. 'I just remember literally picking up something from the floor and then I remember just being in the ER.'  Karissa said she remembers 'flipping out' when she realised what the dog had done to her face.  A friend of Karissa's who was present on the day of the attack gave the doctors her recollection of the day's traumatic events.  Helping hand: Karissa's friend recounted the traumatic course of events that occurred  Striking: Karissa's friend said that she 'started flipping out' when she saw the damage the dog had done to her face  Hoping for help Karissa said, 'I'm so young and I don't want to look like this the rest of my life'  'I was in the bathroom when the bite actually happened,' she said. 'So I go out and my friend's face is missing, so I started flipping out - I call 911, ambulance came.'  Karissa's friend said emergency workers retrieved the missing piece of flesh and 'put it on ice in the ambulance.'  'They had it on ice and the surgeon tried to replace it, but there was so much tissue damage and nerve damage that he couldn't connect it - it was dead tissue,' she said.  Scary: Karissa said she blacked out in the incident, saying, 'I just remember literally picking up something from the floor and then ... just being in the ER'  Karissa became emotional in the surgeons' office revealing how desperate she was to get her injury fixed.  She said: 'It's really hard. It's like I'm so young and I don't want to look like this for the rest of my life. I don't.'  New episodes of Botched air Wednesday evenings on E! at 9/8c.",

Pitt got sober after decades of substance abuse; he re-foucused his energies on being the best father he could be; and he worked with Jolie to hammer out a mutually amicable co-parenting relationship.  (Getty Images)  But according to the folks at Life & Style, not all of the changes in Pitt\u2019s life were quite so beneficial.

Karissa Weckesser, 24, was at a friend\u2019s house playing with her dog when it launched at her, prompting her to black out from the pain. When she awoke, she was in the emergency room as surgeons prepared to repair the damage to her face.\n\nPhysicians attempted to use the flesh that had been torn off, but there was too much tissue damage, and so they took a piece from her lower lip and \u201crolled it up\u201d on her upper lip to minimize the space left where the dog had bitten. But in last night\u2019s episode of Botched, surgeons Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif were able to improve the results by \u201cshortening\u201d her upper lip. Karissa was thrilled with the results and said she could \u201csee my old self again.\u201d\n\nKarissa got her lip corrected after she lost part of her face when she was attacked by a dog. Doctors in the emergency room didn\u2019t risk reattaching her flesh because the tissue had died. At first, the surgeons were unsure if they would be able to fix her mouth as the emergency room doctors had failed to attach the chunk of flesh she had lost when they originally operated.\n\nDr. Nassif explained to Karissa: \u201cSo what they did was they took a piece of your lower lip and kind of rolled it up to fill that defect. \u2018Before doing an aggressive procedure like that, we would\u2019ve maybe just put the tissue together and just see how it heals because it does shorten the sides of your mouth.\u2019\u201d \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to help Karissa. I just hope that her doctor has not done irreversible damage,' he told the camera.\u201d\n\nSurgeons used a part of her lower lip to roll up on her upper lip to fill the wound but left her with a hanging piece of flesh. Karissa was at a friend\u2019s house and playing with her dog when the animal launched into an unprovoked attack. Fortunately, Botched surgeons Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif were able to repair her lip by trimming the dropping skin over her mouth.\n\nKarissa, who was left unable to eat properly because of her injury, was thrilled. She said: \u201cAfter a few unsuccessful reconstruction attempts, I had lost all hope that I would ever be able to eat, feel, or look normal ever again. Thanks to Dr. Nassif, I can open my mouth more and when I look in the mirror, I see my old self.\u201d\n\nThe surgeons told Karissa that blacking out during the incident was common during trauma as it is the brain\u2019s way of protecting itself, but it meant she couldn\u2019t remember what happened to her. Karissa said she remembers \u201cliterally picking up something from the floor and then I remember just being in the ER.\u201d\n\nKarissa became emotional in the surgeons\u2019 office as she revealed the impact of her injury. She continued, \u201cI just remember literally picking up something from the floor and then I remember just being in the ER.\u201d Her friend, who was present on the day of the attack, recounted the traumatic course of events that occurred.\n\n\u201cStriking,\u201d her friend said. \u201cI started flipping out when I saw the damage the dog had done to her face.\u201d Karissa worried that she wouldn\u2019t ever feel \u201cnormal\u201d again because of the damage her injury caused.\n\n\u201cI was in the bathroom when the bite actually happened,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I go out and my friend\u2019s face is missing, so I started flipping out \u2013 I call 911, ambulance came.\u201d Her friend added that emergency workers retrieved the missing piece of flesh and \u201cput it on ice in the ambulance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had it on ice and the surgeon tried to replace it, but there was so much tissue damage and nerve damage that he couldn\u2019t connect it \u2013 it was dead tissue,\u201d she said. Scary. Karissa said she blacked out in the incident, saying, \u201cI just remember literally picking up something from the floor and then\u2026 just being in the ER.\u201d\n\nKarissa became emotional in the surgeons\u2019 office revealing how desperate she was to get her injury fixed. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s like I\u2019m so young and I don\u2019t want to look like this for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNew episodes of Botched air Wednesday evenings on E! at 9/8c.",

In a preview clip for Wednesday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Joey explains that he was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012 and underwent chemotherapy for a year.  'So before the chemo, I was maintaining a weight of 150 pounds. After, I went down to 118 pounds,' Joey says. 'I went to my doctor and he said my muscle mass got affected by the chemo.'  Scroll down for video  Last hope: Joey wants doctors to fix his botched arms after getting implants in his biceps and triceps  Start of it all: Joey was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012, and after a year of chemotherapy he went from 150lbs (left) to 118lbs (right)  Looking back: Doctors told Joey that his muscle mass was affected by the chemotherapy, and he was particularly self-conscious about his skinny arms  After spending a year trying everything from working out to 'doing protein,' Joey was only able to gain back seven pounds.  'I decided to get a little silicone implant in my bicep to give me a little bulk because I'm so self-conscious about my arms,' he admits, noting that he found a doctor who 'seemed to be an expert in male implants.'  However, when he took off the bandages on his arms after his first surgery, he was surprised by the appearance of his arms.  'My left bicep seemed to develop a lot of fluid,' he says. 'I had to have it drained four times, and then it started to shrink and it looked like it was getting sucked in.'  Going under the knife: Joey decided to get bicep implants to beef up his arms  Aftermath: Joey's left bicep needed to be drained four times after surgery, and then it started to shrink into his arm  Say what: When his doctor offered to transfer fat into his bicep to 'give it some volume,' Joey decided to get tricep implants as well  The doctor admitted that he had never seen anything like that before, but he told Joey that he needed a second surgery to put some fat back into his arms to 'break up the scar tissue and give it some volume.'  Although he was less than pleased with the results of his first procedure, Joey decided that he would go under the knife a second time \u2014 and have the same doctor give him tricep implants while transferring fat to his biceps.  'I went back to have the fat transferred, and I decided I'm going to go for the gold. I'm going to get tricep implants too while I'm here,' he says. 'My arms were still very skinny. I thought people make mistakes; work is not always up to par.'  Before the surgery, Joey made sure to tell the doctor that he didn't want his triceps to overwhelm the rest of his body.  End result: Joey developed three fat balls on his bicep after his second surgery  Not happy: 'My triceps are so big I think, maybe, he ordered a thigh implant instead of a tri,' he says of the disastrous surgery  'I said, \"Please, please don't make them too big.\" I said, \"I am a tiny guy,\"' he recalls.  After his second surgery, Joey was once again upset with what he saw.  'My left bicep seemed to develop three little balls of fat, like lumps,' he explains. 'And my triceps are so big I think, maybe, he ordered a thigh implant instead of a tri.'  Not only was he unhappy with the results of his surgeries, his doctor completely ignored him when he tried to reach out to him.  'I wrote him a letter, sent pictures,' he says. 'I never heard back from him.'  Botched Tuesdays at 9pm on E! UK Stream on hayu in the UK and Ireland",

        "doc_2_text": "I was 12 the first time I felt the crippling cramps. I hadn\u2019t yet gotten my period and was happily running around a state fair with my best friend, mouth full of cotton candy, when it hit me: a steady drum of pain beneath my pubic bone, a throbbing in my back that made its way down both my legs. I fell to the muddy ground. Suddenly the Ferris wheel was a nightmare, the carnival games distorted and unpleasant. I blacked out.  At the E.R. they told me it could\u2019ve been a reaction to bad chicken (sure) and sent me home with Pepto-Bismol. Thus began a 15-year routine of pain, questions and nonanswers that would continue until I was found to have endometriosis at age 27. (This delay is not unusual, and the average woman suffers for years before she is given a diagnosis.) My only savior during much of that time? Oral contraception.  Image Lena Dunham in New York City earlier this year. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times  Birth control pills are many women\u2019s method of choice for preventing unintended pregnancy and should be covered by all insurance policies for that reason alone. But for millions of women living with endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cystic acne, migraines, uterine abnormalities and a history of ectopic pregnancies, birth control can be a crucial, even lifesaving, medical treatment. While there is no cure for endometriosis, hormonal contraception can control pain and bleeding by stopping or significantly shortening the length of a woman\u2019s period. It helps keep women with the disease happy, healthy and able to work. Considering how little money the government puts into endometriosis research (last year, the National Institutes of Health allocated around $10 million of its $32 billion budget to it), it\u2019s clear that our country already has a dangerous disregard for women with this common condition. But imagine if this disease that affects about one in 10 women of reproductive age were allowed to progress unhindered. Imagine losing these women\u2019s essential contributions to our world because of a treatable illness.",
        "generated_text": "At the age of 12, I experienced excruciating abdominal cramps that left me unable to enjoy a day at a state fair. The pain was so severe that I had to be rushed to the emergency room, where I was given Pepto-Bismol and sent home. Little did I know that this incident would mark the beginning of a 15-year struggle with a medical condition that would take years to diagnose. I was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis at age 27, and during that time, I found oral contraception to be my only real relief.\n\nEndometriosis is a common condition that affects about one in 10 women of reproductive age. However, despite its prevalence, the government invests very little into researching and treating it. This lack of funding and resources is a dangerous disregard for the millions of women who suffer from this debilitating illness.\n\nWhile there is no cure for endometriosis, hormonal contraception can help manage symptoms such as pain and bleeding by stopping or shortening the length of a woman's period. This is particularly important for women who must continue to work or maintain their daily activities despite their condition.\n\nUnfortunately, not all women have access to the care and treatment they need. Many women with endometriosis go years without receiving a diagnosis, and even when they do, they may not have access to adequate medical care. This not only affects the individual women who suffer from this condition, but also the larger community as a whole, as these women are unable to contribute their full potential to society.\n\nIn a recent reality series episode, a cancer survivor named Joey sought to fix the lumpy biceps and oversized triceps he was left with after his disastrous surgeries. Joey had undergone chemotherapy to treat lymphoma, and his muscle mass was affected by the treatment. Despite trying everything from working out to 'doing protein,' Joey was only able to gain back seven pounds. In a desperate attempt to beef up his arms, he turned to silicone implants, but the results were disastrous. His left bicep developed fluid and needed to be drained four times, and then it started to shrink into his arm. Joey later had fat transferred into his biceps and triceps, but the results were even worse. His triceps became so large that he thought the doctor had mistakenly ordered thigh implants instead of triceps. Joey was upset and ignored when he reached out to his doctor, and he was left feeling unsatisfied and disheartened by the results of his surgeries.\n\nThe story of Joey and the millions of women like him highlights the urgent need for increased funding and resources for endometriosis research and treatment. With adequate funding and resources, women with endometriosis can receive the care and treatment they need to manage their symptoms and lead full and active lives. It is our responsibility to support these women and advocate for their well-being.",

In an extraordinary interview which recalls a doleful rant by his wife Jennifer Aniston earlier this year, the 37-year- old actor says he feels oppressed by fame and has come close to a nervous breakdown.  The star of Fight Club and Seven tells the magazine Vanity Fair he is bored with movies and acting and looks forward to retiring from Hollywood in five to seven years.  Pitt says he spent 18 months in therapy after hitting a psychological barrier. 'I crashed and burned so I wanted to understand how I operate. I came from a place where you had to be crazy to go to a crazy doctor, and my background is very few words.'  In a reference to the singer who spent several weeks in hospital after a breakdown this summer, he adds: 'I've thought about pulling a Mariah Carey but I know too much now.'  Interviewed by Vanity Fair in April, Friends star Miss Aniston said the year in which she married Pitt had been the hardest year of her life and she was dogged by 'low self esteem' and a 'sense of shame'.  Her husband talks in a similar vein about the 'sickness' of his life.  He says: 'The thing with our marriage was that there was an opening in the Hollywood couple slot and unfortunately we've fallen into it, which I don't like very much.  'I don't like throwing us into this box. It doesn't leave us room to be human, to make our mistakes and have our struggles, because that will just be another story, a whole new other life for the rags.'  Like so many before him, Pitt complains he is public property and unable to conduct a normal life.  'We are treated as special. We get away with things that other people can't. And you start to believe the lie that you are special, that you're better than other people.  'You start demanding that kind of treatment. Most of the time I fight it because I know I'm going to get older and it's going to go away but at times I succumb to it.  'I'll tell you truthfully I am completely bored with myself in films. It's time for me to try either a new direction or new horizons.  'I have other interests I want to pursue that mean more to me.  'I find myself looking forward to a family.  'It's not that I'm self absorbed. Anything that's going to take the focus off myself, I welcome.'",

Tiffany Taylor appeared in Thursday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched and detailed her many procedures during her consultation with Doctors Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif.  While she shares a name with Ivanka's sister, Tiffany wanted to take her similarities with the Trump family to the next level after a breakup that ended her 10-year marriage.  Scroll down for video  Say what? Tiffany Taylor (left) shocked two doctors by revealing she has had 13 plastic surgeries in the past year alone in an attempt to look more like her idol, Ivanka Trump (right)  Explaining: The patient detailed her many procedures during her consultation with Doctors Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif on Thursday night's episode of Botched  Decision: While she shares a name with Ivanka's sister, Tiffany (pictured after some of her surgeries) wanted to take her similarities with the Trump family to the next level  Pursuit: Tiffany (pictured after surgery) has put herself through two boob jobs, a nose job, an eyelid lift, liposuction on her stomach and buttocks, and has received cheek fillers  'I've had 13 surgeries,' Tiffany told Dubrow and Nassif. 'I was so pretty before, but I am just more elegant now.'  A before photo of Tiffany shows her with long brown hair, but now she has adopted a platinum blonde that is more similar to her idol's hue.  She also has a thin nose that is reminiscent of Ivanka's facial features.  As for why she so desperately wants to look like Donald Trump's daughter, Tiffany revealed she believes Ivanka to be a 'role model for all women'.  Thus, she has put herself through two boob jobs, a nose job, an eyelid lift, liposuction on her stomach and buttocks.  Tiffany has also received cheek fillers in an attempt to mimic the First Daughter's physique.  Transformation: A before photo of Tiffany shows her with long brown hair (left), but now she has adopted a platinum blonde that is more similar to her idol's hue (right)  More: Despite her numerous procedures, Tiffany still wanted to have more surgery done, and reached out to Dubrow and Nassif because she wanted to fix a 'bump' on her nose  Reason: As for why she so desperately wants to look like Donald Trump's daughter, Tiffany revealed she believes Ivanka to be a 'role model for all women'  Despite these numerous procedures, Tiffany still wanted to have more surgery done, and reached out to Dubrow and Nassif because she wanted to fix a 'bump' on her nose.  The surgeons, however, refused to perform an additional procedure on the patient, since her last nose surgery dated back to four months prior.  'Tiffany should give it time and wait to get any more surgery done, in say, four years!' Dubrow said, sending a political jab in Ivanka's father's way.  When Tiffany revealed she'd had 13 procedures done over the course of the past 12 months, the show's doctors were immediately concerned about the time frame of her surgeries.  'Were you put under anesthesia 13 times in the last year?' Dubrow asked.  'No, three,' Tiffany said slyly, which alerted the doctors to the fact that she has had multiple operations at once.  Process: 'I've had 13 surgeries,' Tiffany (pictured with a pink hunting rifle) told Dubrow and Nassif on the show. 'I was so pretty before, but I am just more elegant now'  Questions: When Tiffany (pictured) revealed she'd had 13 procedures done, the doctors were immediately concerned about the time frame of her surgeries  Probing: Dubrow had a hunch that the surgery had something to do with Tiffany's relationship status, and he jumped in to ask if she is married  Nassif explained to the camera that plastic surgeons sometimes perform multiple procedures in one go.  'They may be small, but you can have up to five or six procedures at one time as long as it's safe,' he added.  Tiffany was all smiles during the consultation, and after catching a glimpse of the look of concern on Nassif's face, she asked him why he looked 'so serious'.  'I am pondering this conversation for a minute,' he admitted. 'I am trying to figure out why would you want to do that much of a transformation that quick.'  Dubrow had a hunch that it has something to do with her relationship status, and he jumped in to ask if she is married.  'No. I was married for like 10 years, but, no, I am single,' she said.  Story: Tiffany then explained she was married for 10 years but is currently single, and told the doctors she had her first surgeries four to five months after the break-up  Seriously? Nassif (left) and Dubrow (right) were both visibly stunned by the amount of surgeries Tiffany had in just a year  Advice: After hearing more about Tiffany's background, Dubrow (right) explained it is 'very common' for people to want plastic surgery after a trauma or a breakup  The doctor responded by asking the next logical question: 'How long after you broke up did you start having these surgeries.'  Tiffany, unknowingly, raised even more concern when she admits that she started getting surgery just four or five months after she and her spouse of a decade split.  'It is very common for people after a traumatic event or a breakup to come in and want to have plastic surgery,' Dubrow told the camera.  'But you have to be very careful of those individuals, that they are doing it for the right reasons, and they don't have unrealistic expectations,' he added. 'That can be a real red flag.'

RDR Staff  About prosopagnosia  About epidermolysis bullosa  In this week\u2019s Hollywood gossip, it was revealed that Brad Pitt does not have a rare disease that is \u2018eating him away.\u2019Whew.However, the actor is no stranger to the rare disease community. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease \u2013 prosopagnosia \u2014 also known as face blindness. According to the article, \"Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls \"a real conversation,\" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.\"It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",

However, the actor is well-known for his support of individuals with rare conditions. Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF), a foundation dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa. In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF. Additionally, in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview, Pitt revealed that he self-diagnosed himself with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness. Prosopagnosia is a condition in which individuals have difficulty recognizing familiar faces. People with prosopagnosia may also struggle to recognize other stimuli such as objects, cars, or animals. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known, but it is often inherited in a familial pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, a woman named Tiffany Taylor recently shocked two doctors by revealing that she had undergone 13 plastic surgeries in the past year alone in an attempt to look more like her idol, Ivanka Trump. She detailed her many procedures during a consultation with Doctors Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif on Thursday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched. Despite her numerous procedures, Tiffany still wanted to have more surgery done and reached out to the doctors because she wanted to fix a \"bump\" on her nose. The surgeons, however, refused to perform an additional procedure on the patient, since her last nose surgery dated back to four months prior. As for why she so desperately wants to look like Donald Trump's daughter, Tiffany revealed she believes Ivanka to be a \"role model for all women\".",

The procedure plunges users into drastic temperatures of -85C for three minutes.  Cryotherapy is widely used to relieve muscle pain, sprains and swelling either via soft tissue damage or post-operative swelling.  It is also claimed to make you feel happier and rejuvenated while helping you to feel stronger and leaving your skin glowing.  The treatment, popular amongst A-listers and sports stars including James Bond actor Daniel Craig and football ace Cristiano Ronaldo, can also reduce white fat cells, reduce stress and help users sleep.  All useful for a nervous Harry, 33, as pressure mounts ahead of his big wedding day.  Harry is having the treatment at the plush \u00a3600-per-month Chelsea gym.

Chanel, a patient on Botched, appears in a preview segment from the show published ahead of Thursday's episode.  Doctors Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif can first be seen examining photos of Chanel and discussing her case, with Dubrow sounding especially alarmed by what he's seeing.  Scroll down for video  Procedures: Chanel, a patient on Botched, was left with completely deformed breasts after three consecutive surgeries that left her nipples seemingly attached directly onto her chest  Beginnings: The patient (pictured) had a breast augmentation, her original surgery, in 1999, after she turned 21 and wast 'really happy' with the results at the time  'They're at the very bottom of her breast tissue,' he says in reference to Chanel's nipples.  Describing the situation further, the surgeon adds: 'The nipples are being tethered right to the chest wall at the breast crease.'  After pointing out that Chanel is 'missing breast tissue', a frustrated Dubrow asks his colleague to let Chanel in.  The patient then explains she had a breast augmentation, her original surgery, in 1999, after she turned 21. Back then, everything seemed to be going well and she was 'really happy' with the results.  Evolution: But went Chanel (pictured) got pregnant, she says in a preview clip published on Thursday, her breasts turned into 'pancakes', marking the beginning of her troubles  Problems: After the pregnancy, 'one was droopy and then one looked bigger,' Chanel recounts in the video about her breasts. Her doctor at the time recommended she get a breast lift  Getting worse: Chanel (pictured entering her consultation with Doctors Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif) took that advice, but the procedure didn't go as well as she'd hoped  'It went perfect,' she says of the breast augmentation. 'It took me from an A to a C and they were beautiful.'  But went Chanel got pregnant, she adds, her breasts turned into 'pancakes'.  'They deflated,' Dubrow comments with a knowing look.  'One was droopy and then one looked bigger,' Chanel recounts. Her doctor at the time recommended she get a breast lift.  Chanel took that advice, but the procedure didn't go as well as she'd hoped. That's when her breasts started getting 'a little bent in', she explains in the video.  'Scar tissue formed it sucked the lower portion of the breast tissue in,' Dubrow adds.  Fresh start? After the lift, Chanel's breasts started to get a little 'bent in', she explains in the clip, so she decided to have the implants removed altogether  Complications: But removing breast implants can actually cause the immune system to 'continue the contraction process', Dubrow explains in the video  At that point, Chanel decided she would be happy to go back to her original 32 A size, hoping things would return to normal\u2014but they didn't.  'Sometimes, when you take the implant out, it induces the immune system to continue the contraction process and can actually make it look even worse,' Dubrow explains.  Chanel did consult plastic surgeons to try to restore her breast's appearance, but she weight more than 282 pounds, which kept her from undergoing a new procedure.  She has lost significant weight over the last two and a half years, and now finds that she is 'ready' to handle another surgery.  The preview segment ends with Nassif apparently determined to help Chanel, saying she is an 'incredible person' who 'deserves help'.",

On Sunday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif met the Bruna twins, Nadinne and Dannita, who were concerned that their individual issues with their bodies were hindering their modeling careers.  But it was their plump backsides that were on the surgeons minds, and Dr. Nassif came right out and asked: 'Your butts, are they natural?'  Ample assets: Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif were amazed by Nadinne and Dannita Bruna's butt augmentations on Sunday night's episode Botched  Million dollar question: Dr. Nassif couldn't resist asking if their butts were 'natural', and Nadinne admitted that they each had a fat transfer butt augmentation  Dedicated: When a shocked Dr. Dubrow asked there they got the fat, hey explained they had gained about six pounds each to qualify for the procedure  'Eight months ago, we did a fat transfer in Colombia,' Nadinne explained, and Dr. Dubrow couldn't figure out how that was possible considering their incredibly trim physiques.  'Where did you get the fat?' he asked in disbelief.  Nadinne admitted that they actually had to gain weight, about six pounds each, to get the procedure, and Dr, Dubrow guessed that they had to about 300cc's of fat injected into both of their butts.  Asking for help: Despite the interest in their backsides, the twins actually wanted surgery on two very different areas. Nadinne wanted the doctors to fix the sagging skin under her arm  Uniboob: Dannita, who has had five boobs jobs, wanted the doctors to fix her breasts implants, which met in the middle of her chest  Not having it: Dr. Dubrow told Dannita that she would need to get smaller breast implants if he were to fix the issue, but she refused his offer  'The Bruna twins had probably the largest fat transfer buttock augmentation I've ever seen.' Dr. Dubrow told the camera.  As for facial surgeries, Dannita said they only had Botox and their lips and teeth done, and despite the interest in the their backsides, they were actually seeking help from the doctors for very different reasons.  'I was fat like really fat. I lost about 35lbs,' Nadinne said of her previous figure, explaining she wanted the skin under her arms to be tightened.  And while Nadinne had three breast augmentations so far, her sister has had five with disastrous results.  Wanting it gone: Nadinne hoped the doctors could get rid of the sagging skin under hear arms  Opting out: However, she also ended up declining surgery when the doctors warned the procedure would leave her with a bit scar  Fresh-faced: Nadinne and Dannita are pictured when they were younger before their surgeries  After her first boob job, Dannita developed symmastia, meaning her breast implants meet in the middle of the chest, with little or no separation between them.  'The fact that a symmastia occurred with only a 290 cc implant unfortunately indicates that it was probably just a poorly done procedure,' Dr. Dubrow noted to the camera.  When the doctors went on to examine the twins, they explained to Dannita that they could only fix her breasts if she was willing to get smaller implants - which she wasn't.  Got it, flaunt it! The twins love to show off their ample curves as models  Ain't broke, don't fix it! At the end of the episode, they both decided they liked their bodies the way they were  Her choice: Dannita explained that her large breasts earn her a lot of money, so she would rather they be connected than cut down the size of her chest  Dannita insisted that her breasts earn her a lot of money, and she would rather live with the symmastia than cut down the size of her chest.  Meanwhile, Nadinne also opted out of surgery after she learned that in order to have her excess skin removed she would have to have the skin cut from her shoulder to her wrist, and she would be left with a large scar.  At the end of the episode they were seen proudly showing off their bodies in skimpy bikinis as they rubbed suntan lotion over each other.  'We are confident right now and are best the way we are,' the twins said.",

Dr. Steve Fallek, New Jersey plastic surgeon \u2013 who has never met the actor \u2013 claims that his forehead looks smoother in recent pictures. Is it possible that one of the hottest men on the planet went under the knife?  According to Cafe Mom, Dr. Fallek goes on to say that Pitt looks to have some filler in his cheeks, mouth, and around the eyes to improve the lines. Plus, an unnamed source claims that the 54-year-old went to a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon to get Botox, fillers, and some eye work.  Stories surfaced last spring that Pitt felt the divorce has taken a toll on his looks, prompting his need for a little nip and tuck. But, could there be any truth to these rumors?  Gossip Cop says absolutely not, and this is just a tabloid\u2019s attempt at end-of-the-year nonsense. Their \u201cimpeccable\u201d Pitt source says that if he looks different, it\u2019s because he has stopped drinking and is focused on healthy living.  An inside source recently told People that his divorce from Jolie was actually a good thing for the Fight Club star.  \u201cIn a sense, this split was good for Brad because he sized himself up and realized there had to be changes,\u201d revealed the source.  The divorce is not yet final, but the former couple is doing everything they can to move forward and coordinate their schedules so they both can get quality time with their six children.  Per W Magazine, Pitt has put himself back out there and started \u201ccasually dating\u201d a little more than a year after his split from Jolie. But, he\u2019s not jumping in too fast and is not getting serious with anyone yet.  Pitt does have a history of serial monogamy, but he seems to be taking the natural step of moving on after a breakup with caution and not wanting to get seriously involved with anyone right away.  Since his split from Jolie, tabloids have linked him to different actresses, including Jennifer Lawrence, Sienna Miller, and Kate Hudson, but all have denied the allegations. Plus, the rumor that he was dating 21-year-old Ella Purnell, a young Jolie look-a-like, was nothing more than outrageous fan fiction.  Advertisement  Pitt told GQ Style last May that he has changed a lot since his marriage ended and he is happy to be sober. When the interviewer asked why he stopped drinking, Brad Pitt replied that he simply didn\u2019t want to live that way anymore.",

We tapped a couple facial plastic surgeons to get a better understanding of facial anatomy.  \u201cTimeline-wise, it\u2019s not clear when the facial paralysis started after laser hair removal. However, while anything can happen, it would be unusual for facial paralysis to result from laser treatments, as the facial nerve is usually deeper to the level of the burn,\u201d explains Beverly Hills, CA facial plastic surgeon, Kimberly Lee, MD. \u201cWith deeper burns, sensory nerve endings can be affected, which can lead to numbness. The facial nerve is a motor nerve that is deeper and more robust than sensory nerves. To affect this nerve, the burn would have to be quite deep and substantial and would have to be located in the course of the nerve itself.\u201d  New York facial plastic surgeon Matthew White, MD agrees that while laser hair removal certainly isn\u2019t risk-free, it\u2019s not likely to cause facial paralysis. \u201cThe lasers used for hair removal can\u2019t penetrate deeply enough to damage the facial nerves directly,\u201d he explains. \u201cHowever, a laser could reactivate a virus, which can lead to Bell\u2019s Palsy, [a condition that does cause paralysis].\u201d  Bottom line: While it\u2019s not so clear-cut what might have happened, Glanville\u2019s experience is a reminder that all cosmetic procedures come with some risk of side effects.

Late-night hosts joined activists, politicians, journalists and military members on Wednesday night in their criticism over Trump\u2019s plan, which he announced through a series of tweets earlier in the day.  Trump tweeted that the U.S. government \u201cwill not accept or allow\u201d transgender people to serve \u201cin any capacity\u201d in the military. \u201cOur military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\u201d  Later during the White House press briefing, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump\u2019s plan was a \u201cmilitary decision,\u201d adding that Trump\u2019s national security advisers helped him to make the decision.

If you constantly draw attention to yourself, spend all day distracting everyone and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, the perfect job for you isn\u2019t the military, it\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d  James Corden turned to music on CBS\u2019 Late Late Show to criticize Trump\u2019s announcement. He sang a parody of the song \u201cL-O-V-E\u201d with the letters \u201cLGBT.\u201d  \u201cB to his dumb knowledge is just a phase in college, T he finds confusing so the Army\u2019s now refusing, trans women who only want to serve, trans men who want rights we all deserve,\u201d sang Corden. He added, \u201cTrump\u2019s got hate for me and you.\u201d  \u201cHow is their disruption worse than Trump\u2019s corruption, why\u2019s it such a crisis, thousands willing to fight ISIS,\u201d Corden continued in his tuxedo and tophat. \u201cLGBT we love all of you,\u201d he sang, waving a rainbow flag.  Corden also spoke about the ban in his monologue saying that usually when Trump \u201cwants to keep someone out of military service he just fakes a doctor\u2019s note saying he has a foot injury.\u201d He added, \u201cWorked fine for him during Vietnam.\u201d  Earlier on CBS, Late Show host Stephen Colbert came to the conclusion that the president is \u201creally off his meds.\u201d  \u201cToday, he went from crazy to cruel,\u201d Colbert said, reading Trump\u2019s tweets announcing a transgender military ban, which ended in \u201cthank you.\u201d  \u201cThank you? Fuck you,\u201d responded Colbert, to loud applause from his audience.  Colbert also took the liberty of editing Trump\u2019s tweet to reflect Trump\u2019s true feelings.  Samantha Bee shared a similar (word-for-word) sentiment on TBS\u2019 Full Frontal for Trump\u2019s sign-off in his tweet. \u201cThank you? Fuck you,\u201d she said.  \u201cFiring thousands of active-duty service members during the big push against ISIS is Trump\u2019s version of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u2019 He didn\u2019t ask anyone if it was a good idea and didn\u2019t tell anyone he was doing it,\u201d said Bee.  The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah broke down Trump\u2019s tweets, as well as his history with the LGBTQ community (and his history of forgetting parts of the acronym).  \u201cJust so we\u2019re on the same page,\u201d the Comedy Central late-night host said, \u201cTransgender-related military expenses for the military cost at most $8 million per year \u2026 In contrast, taxpayers will be paying $60 million per year just for Trump to visit his own properties like Mar-a-Lago. And that\u2019s before he orders dessert.\u201d  Noah had two transgender military veterans on his show to speak about the ban. \u201cThe past administration made a lot of strides in order to lift this ban,\u201d said Joey Whimple. He said individuals felt \u201cthat safety net to come out\u201d and now the \u201ccarpet is being completely pulled out from underneath\u201d leaving a question of uncertainty.  On NBC\u2019s Late Night With Seth Meyers, the host turned it over to four of his female writers for reactions.  \u201cPresident Trump, you just requested a $600 billion military budget,\u201d said writer Amber Ruffin. \u201cYou think you can\u2019t afford health care for trans people? The military spends $41 million a year on Viagra. What are you guys doing, screwing the enemy to death?\u201d  Referencing a recent tweet by Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, in which she wrote she was \u201cproud to support my LGBT friends,\u201d the writers tossed it over to the \u201cdaughter to the president and world-renowned entrepreneur\u201d \u2014 only to show an empty podium at the White House. The gag was repeated later with footage of a tumbleweed crossing a desolate road and a lone wolf howling in a snowy field. \u201cShe\u2019s just stuck in traffic,\u201d noted the writers.  Chelsea Handler previewed Friday\u2019s episode of her Netflix show with a message to the transgender community: \u201cI\u2019m sorry a man that has never served in the military a day in his life is denying you the right to serve your country. Thank you for your service and thank you for your bravery. And to the members of the Republican party who continue to choose party over politics, grow a fucking spine!\u201d",

        "generated_text": "President Donald Trump has been criticized for his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military. Trump announced the plan through a series of tweets on Wednesday, stating that the U.S. government \"will not accept or allow\" transgender people to serve \"in any capacity\" in the military. Trump cited concerns over the \"tremendous medical costs\" and \"disruption\" that transgender people would bring to the military. The plan has been met with widespread criticism from celebrities, activists, and military members. Jimmy Fallon invited transgender comedian Patti Harrison on The Tonight Show to share her thoughts on the issue. Samantha Bee shared a similar sentiment on TBS's Full Frontal, saying \"Fuck you\" to Trump's tweet. Trevor Noah had two transgender military veterans on his show to speak about the ban, and Noah broke down Trump's tweets and his history with the LGBTQ community.

The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the \u201cthe political side of activism\u201d and \u201cwould look for a senatorial run.\u201d  \u201cCan I do a better job from the outside?\u201d said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. \u201cKind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.\u201d  When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are \u201cno further details to report at this time.\u201d  This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.  I have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real\u2026 https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1 \u2014 KidRock (@KidRock) July 12, 2017  After meeting with then-President-elect Trump in December, West tweeted, \u201c#2024,\u201d causing fans to speculate whether he\u2019s delaying a run for president and whether he is serious about running at all.  Jenner also expressed an interest in public service during an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon in April.  Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 general election, but has also expressed disappointment is some of the Trump administration\u2019s policies.  \u201cWell @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster,\u201d Jenner tweeted in February after the Trump administration rolled back protections for transgender students put in place by former President Barack Obama. \u201cYou made a promise to protect the L.G.B.T.Q. community.

        "doc_1_text": "While most of President Donald Trump\u2019s offspring and their spouses have been mired in scandal or investigations, or have just been the butt of late-night jokes (see: Eric and Tiffany), Eric Trump\u2019s wife Lara Trump has managed to glide above the fray.  That was until Thursday when former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman released a secret recording of a conversation with Lara Trump. Manigault Newman played the recording on MSNBC to bolster her contention that Trump\u2019s loyal daughter-in-law tried to buy her silence after she was fired from the White House staff.  On the recording, Lara Trump, a senior member of the president\u2019s 2020 campaign, can be heard offering Manigault Newman a $15,000-a-month contract to work in his re-election campaign.  Lara Trump also discussed salary considerations and a job that didn\u2019t sound as though it had any clear responsibilities.  Most questionably, Lara Trump also addressed the likelihood that Manigault Newman would have \u201csome things in the back pocket to pull out,\u201d before telling her she would be expected to only say positive things about the president, his campaign and perhaps his family.  \u201cEverything, everybody, positive, right?\u201d Lara Trump asks.  The release of the recording sent Lara Trump\u2019s name into the top 10 Twitter trending topics. People made jokes: \u201cThat money is meant for silencing porn stars.\u201d But they also raised concerns about whether the Trump campaign was using donations raised from \u201cworking class\u201d supporters to fund hush money payments to disgruntled former employees.  For probably the first time as a Trump loyalist and family member, the 35-year-old former \u201cInside Edition\u201d producer and mother of one found herself in the middle of a white-hot controversy.  In a written statement to the Washington Post, she declared the recording \u201ca fraud\u201d and claimed that the snippets that were aired \u201ctook place in numerous phone calls over the course of several weeks.\u201d  Lara Trump also said she had felt betrayed by the former \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d villain. She referred to their time campaigning together for Trump in 2016 and said she had come to regard Manigault Newman as \u201ca friend and a campaign sister.\u201d Lara Trump concluded, \u201cI am absolutely shocked and saddened by her betrayal and violation on a deeply personal level.\u201d  Having to issue this kind of public defense probably is unfamiliar territory for Lara Trump, even though she is regarded by some as \u201cthe face\u201d of the Trump 2020 campaign. She has put herself out there as one of Trump\u2019s most reliable advocates, making regular appearances on Fox News or at rallies to tout his agenda.  Her name also is affixed to a steady stream of emails that go out to supporters, in which she often solicits for donations in small amounts \u2014 $1, $5, $10 or $20.  For example, in a July 24 email, Lara Trump offered a \u201ctop patriot\u201d the chance to win a backstage VIP pass to the president\u2019s upcoming rally. All this \u201cpatriot\u201d needed to do was make one of those small money donations to have their name entered to win.  \u201cMy father-in-law has tuned out the mainstream media,\u201d Lara Trump said in her email. \u201cHe cares more about knowing he has support from patriots like you.\u201d  Even with all this fierce advocacy, Lara Trump has mostly remained above the political fray. She doesn\u2019t engage in belligerent Twitter fights like her brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr.. And, unlike sister-in-law Ivanka Trump, she hasn\u2019t been the subject of backlash over clumsy efforts to weigh in on issues like racism, women\u2019s rights, migrant children or the LGBTQ community.  In fact, Lara Trump doesn\u2019t often get clumsy on social media \u2014 unlike her in-laws. Her Instagram is mostly filled with what Slate called \u201cbland\u201d photos of Eric Trump, their nearly 1-year-old son Luke, their two beagles, or of her working out, showing off her slender, 5-foot-11 frame doing hardcore gym workouts.  On her Instagram and Twitter feed, she also shares political photo-ops, promos for her Fox News appearances and retweets from like-minded politicos, urging support of particular candidates or Republican causes. With regard to her political posts, she\u2019s sticks to a core message, according to Slate: \u201cThe truth is, we all know what Lara Trump\u2019s special thing is: It\u2019s that she supports her father-in-law, the president.\u201d  In April, E! News called Lara and Eric Trump the \u201cmost normal, least controversial Trump couple.\u201d Most stories that focus on Lara Trump quote her as offering pleasant accounts about how she and Eric Trump met about a decade ago. Lara Trump told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that she and her future husband were out with friends and bonded over the fact that they were \u201c\u201dprobably the two tallest people in the room,\u201d according to E! News.  \u201cI think we spotted each other across the room,\u201d Lara Trump said about Eric, who is 6-foot-5 inches and therefore towers over his siblings. \u201cI was immediately intrigued and hopefully Eric felt the same way. It took us about three months to go on a date.\u201d  They married in 2014 in grand Trump fashion \u2014 at Mar-a-Lago. As soon as her father-in-law announced his presidential aspirations, Lara Trump jumped in to help out. After the election, she joined the Trump re-election efforts with her advocacy continuing even after she gave birth to her son last September.  During the 2016 election, Lara Trump spoke at rally in her home state of North Carolina, where she shared her excitement with voters about being part of her father-in-law\u2019s political movement.  \u201cI never expected, when I moved nine years ago to New York City, that this would ever happen to me,\u201d said Lara Trump who, according to the Port City Daily, originally moved to New York City to attend culinary school. \u201c(Being a part of this campaign) is the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d",

        "generated_text": "President Donald Trump's recent announcement via Twitter that the U.S. government \"will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military\" has sparked outrage among many, including celebrities who took to their social media accounts to voice their dissent. While some, like Seth Rogen and Ivanka Trump, called on the Trump family to remember their promises to the LGBTQ community, others, like Caitlyn Jenner and George Takei, pointed out the sacrifices that transgender service members have made for the country.\n\nQuestlove and Mia Farrow also joined the chorus, challenging Trump's ban and expressing their support for the LGBTQ community. Uzo Aduba, on the other hand, reaffirmed the equality of all Americans, regardless of their gender identity.\n\nMeanwhile, Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump and a senior member of the president's 2020 campaign, found herself in the middle of a controversy after former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman released a secret recording of a conversation between the two. In the recording, Lara Trump offered Manigault Newman a $15,000-a-month contract to work in his re-election campaign and discussed salary considerations and a job that didn't seem to have any clear responsibilities.\n\nThe release of the recording sent Lara Trump's name into the top 10 Twitter trending topics, with people making jokes about the money being meant for silencing porn stars. However, concerns were also raised about whether the Trump campaign was using donations raised from \"working class\" supporters to fund hush money payments to disgruntled former employees.\n\nIn a written statement to the Washington Post, Lara Trump declared the recording \"a fraud\" and claimed that the snippets that were aired \"took place in numerous phone calls over the course of several weeks.\" She also said she had felt betrayed by the former \"Celebrity Apprentice\" villain and referred to their time campaigning together for Trump in 2016 as \"a friend and a campaign sister.\"\n\nDespite her strong advocacy for her father-in-law and his agenda, Lara Trump has mostly remained above the political fray, unlike her in-laws. Her Instagram is mostly filled with photos of Eric Trump, their son Luke, their beagles, and her working out. Her political posts mainly stick to a core message of supporting her father-in-law, and she doesn't often engage in belligerent Twitter fights like her brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr.",

Some \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 saw it is a speak-truth-to-power moment \u00e0 la Stephen Colbert\u2019s speech at the 2006 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner. Others \u2013 mostly on the right \u2013 viewed it as a vile, hate-filled address that was neither funny nor appropriate.  Most journalists in the room \u2013 and I was among them \u2013 were largely quiet during Wolf\u2019s speech, particularly the second half when she got very personal about Sanders. (No, this does not mean journalists are humorless or can\u2019t laugh at themselves \u2013 so save it.)  I took a bunch of my notes on my phone during Wolf\u2019s speech. I thought I\u2019d share them \u2013 and expand on them \u2013 here. These are in no order other than how they occurred to me. (You can watch the whole speech yourself here.)  Wolf had zero interest in playing to the room  Introducing the \u201cDaily Show\u201d comic, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Margaret Talev praised Wolf as someone who was very much not part of the world of Washington. That was seen as a good thing, given that the criticism of Washington and its denizens since the election of Trump is that they/we are deeply out of touch with normal Americans. (A coastal comedian is not exactly \u201cregular\u201d people, but whatever.) I wonder whether Talev thought Wolf\u2019s I-could-care-less-about-any-of-you approach was such a great idea after the comedian\u2019s speech.  Most comedians who speak at the correspondents\u2019 dinner take a fair number of shots at the attendees in the room. But they also play along with theme of the night, which attempts to be a celebration of the free and independent media as well as a chance to shine a light on some of the best journalists in the country.  Wolf didn\u2019t do that. She wanted to napalm the room. And she did. Unapologetically.  Wolf went for lots of low-hanging fruit  There are LOTS of way to go after Sanders. I personally think that she is overly antagonistic to the reporters who cover the White House and misleads on the regular. But to make fun of Sanders\u2019 makeup? (\u201cI think she\u2019s very resourceful, like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Maybe she\u2019s born with it, maybe it\u2019s lies,\u201d said Wolf.) Like, really?  I know lots of liberals will \u2013 and already have via Twitter \u2013 painted the attacks on Sanders as the press secretary getting what she deserved. I don\u2019t subscribe to that idea. Sanders showed up, sat on the dais and played along. She knew she was likely to get made fun of. But she would have no reasonable expectation that Wolf would go after her looks and refer to her as an \u201cUncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women.\u201d  I\u2019m stunned that Sanders sat five feet away from Wolf and just took it.  Being funny is one thing. Bullying people because you can is another. And Wolf\u2019s treatment of Sanders was bullying.  And, yes, by the way, Trump is a massive bully. Making fun of a disabled reporter, stereotyping ethnic groups, attacking reporters for how they look \u2013 all of that stuff is totally and completely unacceptable. And he knows exactly what he is doing, which makes it worse.  But two wrongs don\u2019t make it right. Because Trump bullied a disabled reporter doesn\u2019t mean Wolf should be able to bully Sarah Sanders. Bullying is bullying. And it\u2019s wrong. Always.  Wolf\u2019s criticism of the media was (generally) on point  The most powerful line of Wolf\u2019s speech, which will inevitably get overshadowed by what she said about Sanders, was this on the media and Trump:  \u201cHe has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.\u201d  The first sentence there is 100% right. It is absolutely beyond debate that Trump has been good for the news business. The amount of news he creates coupled with the number of people who consume news about him has made cable news and print media more relevant (and profitable) than ever before.  The second sentence I take some issue with. Yes, cable ran Trump\u2019s primary speeches because he said and did things that no one else would do \u2013 and that people would watch. And, yes, when I was at The Washington Post, I wrote about Trump regularly because he said and did things that no one else did.  But that, to me, is different than \u201ccreating\u201d Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy was formed and sharpened by an angry and embittered GOP electorate who was sick of their own party, of Washington, of the media, of everything. He was rising whether the media covered him wall to wall or not; he was the angry id of the GOP. The media didn\u2019t create that.  The abortion stuff was beyond the pale  Here\u2019s Wolf\u2019s joke about Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s opposition to abortion: \u201cHe thinks abortion is murder which, first of all, don\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it \u2014 and when you do try it, really knock it. You know, you\u2019ve got to get that baby out of there.\u201d  Does anyone think this joke is funny? You can hate abortion and think it is murder. You can feel as though it\u2019s not the government\u2019s business what you do with your body and how you handle your own life. But, does anyone celebrate abortion \u2013 even jokingly?  Wolf got exactly what she wanted  Don\u2019t be fooled: Wolf knew exactly what she was doing on Saturday night. She knew that the speech \u2013 at least in parts \u2013 was likely to go over like a lead balloon in the room. And that it would stir huge amounts of controversy in its wake.  THAT WAS THE POINT.  Ask yourself this: Did the average person know who Wolf was before Saturday night? (I will admit, I did not. And, yes, I know Wolf had never heard of me either.) Search interest in her soared last night and continued to spike Sunday morning, according to Google Trends. She is the talk of every Sunday talk show. She will be a regular topic on cable TV \u2013 and late-night TV \u2013 this week.  On a related note, her Netflix series, \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf\u201d \u2013 comes on May 27. She couldn\u2019t buy better publicity for that show than she got with her speech on Saturday night.",

        "doc_1_text": "All major networks and cable news channels will broadcast the speech live. The White House will stream it live on its site, as will news networks through Facebook. The livestream will also be available on POLITICO here.  How long is the speech?  The State of the Union has no set length. President Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest address, lasting 89 minutes, and President Ronald Reagan the shortest \u2014 roughly 31 minutes \u2014 according to The American Presidency Project. Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress last year, which was not an actual State of the Union, was about an hour.  What topics will Trump cover?  The White House announced last week that the president would release his complete immigration policy \u201c framework\u201d before the State of the Union, so this will almost certainly be a centerpiece. According to a White House official, Trump\u2019s speech will be one of unity as he tries to appeal to a fiercely divided Congress.  Trump will also take a page from his speech on Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and talk about strong economic growth in the U.S., as well as the benefits of the recently enacted tax changes and an America-first trade policy. In view of the recent nuclear threats from North Korea, the Republican leader will highlight a national security policy of \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d the White House official said. He also plans to use the opportunity to reveal the details of his long-awaited infrastructure plan.  Of course, the president has demonstrated considerable unpredictability in his first year in office, straying from scripted speeches and creating headaches for his staff. So whether he\u2019ll deviate on Tuesday remains to be seen.  What issues are on the minds of voters?  Besides immigration, border security, infrastructure and tax changes, voters may want the president to outline some sort of plan for health care. And while there is great interest in recent reports of Trump\u2019s unsuccessful order that special counsel Robert Mueller be fired last year, it\u2019s hard to imagine the president would use the State of the Union to address such a legally fraught subject or talk about the Russia investigation at all.  VIDEO State of the Union Preview President Trump will deliver his first official State of the Union Address.  How will the midterm elections feature in the address?  With the fall 2018 elections fast approaching, lawmakers have a narrow window for swaying voters. Polls show an overall advantage for Democratic candidates over Republicans, who now control both chambers of Congress. Democrats who boycott the president\u2019s address could face praise or backlash from their constituents, possibly affecting election results this fall.  Who\u2019s on the guest list for the State of the Union?  The president and first lady Melania Trump have invited 15 special guests, ranging from workers and business owners who have benefited from the economy, to parents of gang-violence victims, to military members and public servants, to volunteers.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), several Democratic senators and more than two dozen House members, including Reps. Gerry Connelly of Virginia and David Price of North Carolina, will bring DACA recipients and other undocumented immigrants to the address. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) tweeted on Monday she was bringing San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who condemned Trump\u2019s visit to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria in October. Also on Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced that she would bring Brockton City Councilor-At-Large Jean Bradley Derenoncourt, the first Haitian-American man to win election to a public office in Massachusetts.  Who\u2019s not coming?  Several House Democrats announced they would not attend, including Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), John Lewis (D-Ga.), Jan Schakowsky, (D-Ill.), Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.). Reps. Jayapal, Lewis, Waters, and Wilson decided to skip it after Trump\u2019s incendiary comments on Haiti and other African countries. Blumenauer will instead send a a DACA recipient, a so-called Dreamer, in his place to \u201cremind Trump that these are real people with families and jobs, who are vital to our communities.\u201d Schakowsky, who is also boycotting because of president\u2019s comments, said in a statement, \u201cThe American people have been subjected to a year of racist, erratic, and divisive behavior from their Commander in Chief, and I refuse to accept that as the new normal.\u201d  Who is the designated survivor?  The White House announced Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as the designated survivor on Tuesday evening, just hours before the president\u2019s address. Perdue has traveled to more than 30 states since his confirmation last April, addressing the concerns of farmers and rural Americans.  Where is Trump going after the State of the Union?  The president is expected to tour the country and give several speeches along the way. The plans are still being finalized, according to officials.  Who\u2019s delivering the Democratic response?  Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) will deliver the response. Some of his viral speeches criticizing GOP tactics and Trump\u2019s response to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville have garnered millions of views.  As the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, he is viewed as having star potential and is a member of a younger wave of Democrats. The response will be Kennedy\u2019s first chance to shine at the national level. Previous opposition-party responses have been viewed with mixed success and could provide memorable moments, like Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s (R-Fla.) need for water during his 2013 response to President Barack Obama.  ",

Say good-bye to \u201cBlack History Month\u201d and hello to \u201cNational African American History Month.\u201d Just like with many of his casinos and hotels, President Donald Trump, 70, has decided to take a pre-existing institution and slap his own branding on it, as TMZ reports Trump\u2019s changing the name of the month dedicated to celebrating America\u2019s finest citizens of color.  After Trump met with African American leaders, a senior administration official tells TMZ, Donald was convinced that the term \u201cblack\u201d is outdated, and the more appropriate way to refer to the community is \u201cAfrican American.\u201d Hmmm, sounds like Donald\u2019s trying to be a little bit more politically correct!  Update: Guess what! TMZ has updated their story to point out that yes, most modern presidents have referred to it as \u201cNational African American History Month\u201d and Donald did NOT change it.  Trump also noticed how the newest addition to the Smithsonian museum was called the \u201cNational Museum of African American History and Culture,\u201d the official tells TMZ. So, Trump decided to change the month\u2019s name. Ever since 1976, every U.S. president has designated February as \u201cBlack History Month,\u201d but Donald has reportedly decided to do his own thing. HollywoodLife.com has reached out for a comment on this report.  Donald\u2019s sudden interest in African American studies comes one day after his strange behavior regarding Frederick Douglass. The abolitionist, former slave and suffrage advocate was brought up by the ex-Celebrity Apprentice star during a Black History Event on Feb. 1, according to The Atlantic. While talking about Frederick during Black History Month isn\u2019t unusual, Donald\u2019s blathering seemed to indicate he thought Mr. Douglass was still alive.  \u201cI am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things,\u201d Donald said. \u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d Yeah, someone tell Donald that Frederick died on Feb. 20, 1895, nearly 122 years ago. He hasn\u2019t \u201cdone an amazing\u201d anything in more than a century.  Even Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, 45, struggled to spin Donald\u2019s comments, trying to convince the world that Donald didn\u2019t think Mr. Douglass was somehow immortal. \u201cI think there\u2019s contributions \u2014 I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made,\u201d Sean said, per the Washington Post. \u201cAnd I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he\u2019s going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more.\u201d Huh?

And with the American College of Sports Medicine's annual survey, we're getting a look at what's going to be big this year. They've pinpointed the top fitness trends of 2018 to watch for, and chances are, if you haven't gotten in on any of them yet, you just might soon.  Published in the ACSM\u2019s Health & Fitness Journal, more than 4,000 fitness professionals (including trainers, exercise physiologists, and fitness directors) gave their thoughts on the trends they think will be big in 2018. The survey respondents represented organizations including the American College of Sports Medicine, American Council on Exercise, National Council on Strength and Fitness, and The Cooper Institute. The responses were international, too, coming from 41 countries across the world and nearly every continent.  In the survey, the ACSM made an important distinction between a trend and a fad to the participants. While a trend was defined as \u201ca general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving,\" a fad was \"a fashion that is taken up with great enthusiasm for a brief period.\" (Shout-out to '80s Jazzercise and '90s Tae Bo.) For the purposes of this survey, the ACSM was interested in trends, which have more staying power. Survey respondents were asked to rank 40 potential fitness trends on a 10-point scale, where 1 was least likely to be a trend in 2018, and 10 was most likely to be a trend in 2018.  Here are the top 10 fitness trends of 2018, according to the pros\u2014and what you need to know about each one.  1. High-Intensity Interval Training  High-intensity interval training (or HIIT) took the top spot in this year's survey (it was also number one in 2014). A HIIT training session involves bursts of maximum-effort, very hard work (typically about 20 to 90 seconds), followed by a period of low-intensity recovery. The goal is to recover enough that you can go hard again during your next work interval. If you're a beginner, you might have longer rest intervals, or work intervals that are challenging but not at maximum effort.",

        "doc_2_text": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump released an order Friday night banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under \"limited circumstances,\" following up on his calls last year to ban transgender individuals from serving.  The White House said retaining troops with a history or diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\"\u2014those who may require substantial medical treatment\u2014\"presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.\"  Trump surprised the Pentagon's leadership in a 2017 tweet when he declared he would reverse an Obama-era plan to allow transgender individuals to serve openly. His push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges, and four federal courts have ruled against the ban. The Pentagon responded by allowing those serving to stay in the military, and began allowing transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.  \"This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards \u2014 including those regarding the use of medical drugs \u2014 equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.  The new policy was promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"No one with the strength & bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. This hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor & dignity.\"  The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\"  \"There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin.  Related Story Transparent Cast Devastated by Trump Policy  Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union LGBT & HIV Project, said the policy \"effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.\"  Trump received recommendations from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February for dealing with transgender individuals serving in the military. The White House said Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen agreed with the policy.  Earlier Friday, Maj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.  The issue has become mired in a complicated string of political statements, court decisions and policy reviews since Trump first stunned his administration with his tweets last July. It's unclear how much impact the court decisions will have on Trump's decision. Activist groups had worried the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.  Under guidelines presented in December, the Pentagon could disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, those with a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. Such recruits could be allowed in if a medical provider certified they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.  Transgender individuals receiving hormone therapy must be stable on their medication for 18 months.  The requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass.

The new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards, including those regarding the use of medical drugs, to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen, said White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. However, this policy has been promptly assailed by congressional Democrats and civil rights groups. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that no one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are, and the Human Rights Campaign accused the Trump administration of pushing \"anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.\" Activist groups had worried that the administration could enact such strict enlistment and health care restrictions that it would become all but impossible for transgender troops to join or continue serving.",

In an interview that aired Friday night on Hannity, Spicer admitted, \u201cI\u2019m a prankster, I like a good joke. I think when it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s funny,\u201d but added, \u201cSometimes it goes from funny to mean.\u201d  Spicer, who was famously impersonated on SNL by Melissa McCarthy throughout his time as press secretary, noted, \u201cI think that there were parts of it that were funny, but there\u2019s a lot of it that was over the line. It wasn\u2019t funny. It was stupid, or silly, or malicious.\u201d He added, \u201cBut there were some skits on late-night television that I did crack up at. \u2026 You have to have a little bit of a thick skin if you\u2019re going to do this.\u201d  When asked about his sudden resignation announcement, Spicer explained that though Trump didn\u2019t want him to leave, the two eventually came to an agreement on what would be best for the administration.  \u201cHe\u2019s been very gracious throughout this process. He wanted to bring some new folks in to help rev up the communications operation,\u201d Spicer said of Trump, who hired new White House communications director and New York financier Anthony Scaramucci. As his first act on the job, Scaramucci announced that Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2014 who had, up until now, acted as Spicer\u2019s deputy and filled in for him in recent weeks as he worked more behind the scenes \u2014 would be the new press secretary.  \u201cAfter reflection, my decision was to recommend to the president that I give Anthony [Scaramucci] and Sarah [Huckabee Sanders] a clean slate to start from so that they can talk about the president\u2019s agenda and help move it forward,\u201d Spicer continued. \u201cHe, after some back and forth, understood that the offer that I was making was something that was in the best interest of this administration.

Speaking with Hannity, however, Spicer said he didn\u2019t feel his role was being \u201cdiminished\u201d in any way. He explained that he wanted to give Scaramucci and Sanders \u201cthe opportunity to operate without me in the way. \u2026 I just thought it was in the best interest of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen.\u201d On Trump\u2019s reaction, Spicer said, \u201cHe\u2019s always thinking of others, and I assured him that I would be just fine. \u2026 He assured me that he would continue to be as supportive as he always has been.\u201d  .@seanspicer on @POTUS\u2019 reaction to his resignation: \u201cHe assured me that he would continue to be as supportive as he always has been.\u201d pic.twitter.com/9gUQ1AhY2a \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) July 22, 2017  During his explanations, Spicer mentioned the new team continuing \u201cthe president\u2019s agenda\u201d several times.

Asked by Hannity whether he believes the American people are being served by the media, Spicer noted, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t paint it with a broad brush; I think some, yes \u2026 but in a lot of cases, the answer is no.\u201d  .@seanspicer on media: The stories we hear from around the country aren\u2019t necessarily the stories being covered by those in Washington. pic.twitter.com/FUYwLGcvxw \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) July 22, 2017  White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was interviewed later in the segment, echoed similar sentiments about media bias and agreed with Spicer on the \u201cover the top\u201d nature of being parodied on late-night TV and SNL.  \u201cPerhaps they should give equal time to another opinion,\u201d said Priebus of the NBC sketch series, adding that Spicer\u2019s job requires thick skin. \u201cYou just don\u2019t care what some of this stuff says because you know it\u2019s garbage.\u201d  Spicer\u2019s resignation ended an oft-maligned six-month tenure.

In an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cGMA,\u201d Newman \u2014 whom a senior Trump administration official said was forced out of her job \u2014 contended that she resigned as she approached one year in the White House.  \u201cI resigned, and I didn\u2019t do that in the residence as reported,\u201d Newman said.  \u201cJohn Kelly and I sat down in the Situation Room \u2026 and we had a very candid conversation,\u201d she said, referring to the president's chief of staff.  \u201cI wanted to make the one-year mark,\u201d Newman continued, \"and then get back to my life.\u201d  Newman, however, also hinted at a high level of discord within the West Wing, saying she was unhappy with the way things had gone so far in the Trump presidency.  \"There were a lot of things that I observed during the last year that I was very unhappy with, that I was very uncomfortable with, things that I observed, that I heard, that I listened to,\" Newman said. She was responding to a question about a report in The Washington Post in which friends of Newman said she wasn't pleased with Trump's response to the riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.  \"I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people,\" said Newman, who was one of Trump's highest-profile African-American female supporters and one of the few black women in Trump's West Wing.  \"And when I can tell my story, it is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear,\" she said. Newman wouldn't elaborate on what she was unhappy about, saying, \"I can\u2019t expand on it because I have to go back and work with these individuals.\"  Newman's description of her account prompted \"GMA\" co-anchor Robin Roberts to deliver an apparent shot at her, after the interview had concluded.  \"She said she has a story to tell, and I'm sure she'll be selling that story,\" Roberts said. \"So yeah, she will. Bye, Felicia,\" she said, referencing a popular phrase from the movie \"Friday.\"  Newman left her White House job this week, but the circumstances of her exit have taken on a narrative fit for reality TV \u2014 which is, incidentally, how she and Trump met in the first place.  Related: Omarosa Manigault Causes Uproar at Black Journalists Convention  A source close to the White House told NBC News on Wednesday night that Kelly made the decision to fire Newman and that she was escorted off the White House grounds after trying to re-enter the residence to debate the terms of her departure.  During her interview Thursday, Newman cited tweets by U.S. Secret Service a day earlier that she said backed up her account.  \u201cI think you should take the word of the U.S. Secret service,\u201d she said.  On Wednesday, the agency tweeted that, \u201cReporting regarding Secret Service personnel physically removing Omarosa Manigault Newman from the @WhiteHouse complex is incorrect.\u201d  \u201cThe Secret Service was not involved in the termination process of Ms Manigault Newman or the escort off of the complex. Our only involvement in this matter was to deactivate the individual's pass which grants access to the complex,\u201d the Secret Service\u2019s official account tweeted.  Earlier Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Newman had left her job as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison \"to pursue other opportunities.\" In addition, a White House official said that she and Trump had a \"nice\" conversation on Wednesday, which the official described as \"very cordial.\"  The White House also said that Newman's departure would take effect on Jan. 20, exactly a year after Trump was sworn in. It was unclear whether Newman would be allowed to return to the White House to serve out those remaining 38 days in light of Wednesday night's disclosure.  The timing of Newman's departure was unexpected, said a White House official, who said the president was fonder of her than people realized.  That's likely due to their long history together.  Trump tweeted Wednesday: \"Thank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.\"  Newman came to know Trump during her time as a controversial contestant on several seasons of his reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\" Her brash and manipulative persona on the show both endeared her to Trump and made her a must-watch character.  During the 2016 presidential campaign, Newman rallied crowds ahead of Trump\u2019s appearances, traveling the country with an informal group of other \"women for Trump\" to make his case.",

But on the afternoon on Jan. 17, Pence had another focus: He was so concerned about the criticism he received from U.S. Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon that his staff went to the extraordinary length of asking the U.S. Olympic Committee to set up a conversation between the two \u2013 an offer Rippon turned down.  According to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to speak publicly about it, a member of Pence\u2019s staff requested the conversation with the openly gay Rippon after reading the skater\u2019s derogatory remarks about him in a USA TODAY Sports story that had been published online just an hour earlier.  Rippon, the two people said, declined the invitation.  More:Winter Olympics security workers hit with vomiting illness; military personnel called in for backup  More:Gus Kenworthy feels like 'whole new person' leading into Pyeongchang  The spat between the vice president and the figure skater began when I asked Rippon last month about Pence\u2019s selection for the ceremonial role of leading the U.S. delegation to the Olympic opening ceremony.  \u201cYou mean Mike Pence, the same Mike Pence that funded gay conversion therapy? I\u2019m not buying it,\u201d Rippon said.  After reading the story online, Pence\u2019s press secretary quickly shot back, sending USA TODAY SPORTS a rebuttal to Rippon\u2019s comments:  \u201cThe vice president is proud to lead the U.S. delegation to the Olympics and support America\u2019s incredible athletes,\u201d press secretary Alyssa Farah said. \u201cThis accusation is totally false and has no basis in fact.

Pence apparently was so concerned about Rippon\u2019s comments that he then set in motion the attempt to speak with him. Farah did not reply to an email earlier this week seeking comment, but after the story was published, Jarrod Agen, Pence's deputy chief of staff and communications director, issued a statement.  \"The vice president\u2019s office did not reach out to set up a conversation with Mr. Rippon. As we\u2019ve said before, the Vice President is supporting all the U.S. athletes in the Olympics and is hoping they all win medals.\"  On Jan. 30, nearly two weeks after the dust-up, Rippon said that he was focusing solely on training for the upcoming Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pick a fight with the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said.  Rippon has said several times that he would consider meeting with Pence sometime later.  \u201cIf I had the chance to meet him afterwards, after I\u2019m finished competing, there might be a possibility to have an open conversation,\u201d Rippon said in the interview last month. \u201cHe seems more mild-mannered than Donald Trump. \u2026 But I don\u2019t think the current administration represents the values that I was taught growing up. Mike Pence doesn\u2019t stand for anything that I really believe in.\u201d  The comments from Rippon about gay conversion therapy that so riled Pence come from a widespread belief stemming from a statement Pence made in 2000 on his congressional campaign website: \u201cResources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\u201d  While Pence didn\u2019t explicitly mention gay conversion therapy, leaders in the LGBT community have said they believe that\u2019s exactly what Pence meant in light of his long-standing opposition to gay rights. In November 2016, the New York Times reported that Pence's spokesman at the time, Marc Lotter, denied that Pence supports the practice.  I emailed Farah on Jan. 17 asking what the website statement was referring to, if not gay conversion therapy. She did not send an on-the-record reply.  Rippon, 28, the 2016 U.S. men\u2019s figure skating champion who is one of the first openly gay U.S. Winter Olympians, was selected to his first Olympic team in early January after finishing fourth at the U.S. national championships.  He said he would prefer not to meet Pence during the traditional meet-and-greet between the official delegation and U.S. athletes in the hours leading to the opening ceremony. It\u2019s possible Rippon will have to miss that event anyway to be part of the team figure skating competition.  \u201cIf it were before my event, I would absolutely not go out of my way to meet somebody who I felt has gone out of their way to not only show that they aren\u2019t a friend of a gay person but that they think that they\u2019re sick,\u201d Rippon said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to meet somebody like that.\"  Rippon, who said he was bullied and teased as a boy growing up in Scranton, Pa., came out publicly as being gay in an October 2015 story in Skating magazine. He often talks about how he hopes his story can help others, especially young people who might be struggling with their sexuality.  Always outspoken, Rippon said recently he will not go to the White House for a post-Olympic celebration hosted by President Trump: \u201cI said no.\u201d Legendary skier Lindsey Vonn has also said she will not attend.",

        "doc_2_text": "CNN \u2014  The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won\u2019t \u2013 for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn\u2019t seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.  The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall \u2014 and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means \u2014 and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months \u2014 that, ultimately, this isn\u2019t a legal fight, it\u2019s a public relations one.  Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota. \u201cI\u2019ll be here with my version of the report and they\u2019ll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,\u201d Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.  \u201cMy version\u201d vs. \u201ctheir version.\u201d What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the \u201cversions\u201d will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other \u201cversion\u201d will be Giuliani\u2019s cable TV appearances and President Trump\u2019s tweets.  That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion \u2013 particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump\u2019s side.  Quick, do this thought experiment: Name the first 10 words that come to mind when someone says \u201cMueller probe.\u201d If you are being honest with yourself, my guess is that the words \u201cno collusion,\u201d \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and maybe even \u201c13 Angry Democrats\u201d made it into that top 10. What that means is that even if you roll your eyes when you hear \u201cno collusion,\u201d it seeps into your consciousness \u2014 and that\u2019s a win for Trump.  Especially when you consider that lots and lots of people aren\u2019t rolling their eyes when Trump unleashes a tweet blasting the allegedly partisan bias of Mueller\u2019s team or how the whole probe is based on false pretenses. In a CBS News poll released earlier this week, 70% of Republicans described the Mueller probe as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d That same poll showed that more than nine in 10 \u201cstrong Trump supporters\u201d trust Trump for \u201caccurate information\u201d as compared to 63% who trust \u201cfamily and friends\u201d and 11% who trust the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d  Need more? In March, roughly three in 10 Republicans approved of Robert Mueller in CNN polling. By May, that number was down to 17% approval. That data is backed up by other polls. Last July, a Politico/Morning Consult survey showed that 27% of Republicans had an unfavorable view of Mueller. By this June, that number was 53%.  Those numbers speak to the effectiveness of the PR campaign against Mueller (and his team) by Giuliani and Trump. It also speaks to the fact that this is largely a one-sided conversation. Mueller himself never speaks in public. The special counsel\u2019s office has released only a handful of statements since it was created. Mueller is, rightly, focused on running an effective and thorough investigation. But that leaves him and his team uniquely vulnerable to the campaign-style attacks by Trump and Giuliani. An attack unresponded to, in the context of politics, is an attack believed by some chunk of the voting public. Again, that isn\u2019t Mueller\u2019s concern. He is focused on drawing fact-based conclusions and releasing them in a report. He\u2019s not planning to run for anything.  Trump, on the other hand, is running for a second term. And the President has shown time and time again he is willing to say and do whatever it takes to win an argument in the court of public opinion. Which is what he has set about doing over the past six months or so.  Mock all the \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201ccollusion isn\u2019t even a crime\u201d comments if you want. But remember that a big chunk of people already believe \u2014 before Mueller has released a single final finding \u2014 that his whole probe is a partisan witch hunt that should never have been started in the first place. Short of Mueller producing an email from Trump saying \u201cYes, let\u2019s collude with Russia ASAP!\u201d those people will not change their view \u2014 either on Mueller or Trump. (In truth, even if Mueller did produce an email from Trump that clearly showed collusion with the Russians, I\u2019m not sure that would change the base\u2019s view.)  That\u2019s the secret Trump and Giuliani know \u2013 and have been executing against for months. And like it or not, it\u2019s working.",

        "doc_2_text": "How many false statements did Trump make in his interview with the Wall Street Journal? We count at least five  (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press)  The Wall Street Journal didn\u2019t release the full transcript of the interview its reporters and editors had last week with President Trump, but when Politico obtained a copy and published it, the interview quickly drew attention for several false statements Trump made.  The one that immediately gained notoriety was Trump\u2019s claim that after his speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree last week, \u201cI got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them.\u201d  On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts of America released a statement saying \u201cwe are unaware of any such call.\u201d The Scouts specifically said that neither the organization\u2019s president, AT&T chairman Randall Stephenson, nor its chief executive, Mike Surbaugh, had made such a call.  In fact, Surbaugh last week issued an unprecedented apology for a presidential speech \u2014 Scouts have heard from presidents back to Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 saying he was sorry that some members of the scouting community had been offended by Trump\u2019s partisanship, language and tone.  In the daily White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that other Boy Scout leaders, whom she did not name, had complimented Trump after his speech.  That wasn\u2019t the only call to come into question recently. A few days after the Journal interview, Trump said that Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, had paid him the \u201cultimate compliment\u201d by calling and telling him that \u201ctheir southern border, very few people are coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through our border.\u201d  The Mexican government press office issued a statement Wednesday denying that.  Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u201chas not had recent telephone communication with President Donald Trump,\u201d the statement said.  Sanders said that Pe\u00f1a Nieto did compliment Trump, but in a personal conversation, not a telephone call.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was a lie,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s statements.  Other false statements involved broader factual matters.  \u201cWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world,\u201d Trump said \u2014 a statement that he has repeatedly made and which has repeatedly been debunked. Whether measured by the top tax rate or the overall percentage of national income which is taxed, the U.S. has lower taxes than most of its chief economic competitors.  Trump may have been thinking about the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is higher than most developed countries, although not the highest. Yet few companies actually pay that top rate given various tax deductions, credits and exemptions.  Trump also said \u201cI honestly believe for six months, I have done more than just about any other president when you look at all of the bills that were passed, 42, 43.\u201d  That\u2019s untrue. Many of Trump\u2019s predecessors had signed more legislation, and nearly all recent ones had signed more significant measures by this point in their tenures.  Jimmy Carter had signed 70 bills into law by this point, Bill Clinton 50. Franklin D. Roosevelt had 76 in just his first 100 days.  About one-third of the bills Trump has signed have been ceremonial measures, such as renaming courthouses.  Referring to his top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, Trump said \u201cGary wrote a check for $200 million\u201d when he entered the government. \u201cHe had to pay $200 million in tax.\u201d  Trump has said that before, including in a speech in June. It\u2019s false.  Cohn owned about $220 million in Goldman Sachs stock when he resigned as the bank\u2019s president to become the head of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council. He sold the stock to minimize conflicts of interest, as most appointees do. But he certainly didn\u2019t have to pay $200 million in tax on that sale.  In fact, it\u2019s likely Cohn hasn\u2019t paid any tax so far. He may never have to.  Federal law allows appointees to government positions to defer any tax they owe on assets that they sell to avoid conflicts. The law requires that they put the proceeds of the sale into neutral investments such as Treasury securities. If his securities go up in value, Cohn might have to pay tax on that gain. The top tax rate on capital gains is 20%.  Trump also repeated a false claim about his defeated rival from the election, Hillary Clinton.  \u201cReal crimes are what Hillary did with 33,000 emails, where she deleted them and bleached them after getting a subpoena.\u201d  Trump made that claim more than once during the campaign, and more recently on Twitter.  He is correct that Clinton deleted 33,000 emails from the private server she used for her messages while she was secretary of State. She says that all of those deleted emails were personal and that she had no obligation to keep them. No one has come up with evidence to the contrary.  The evidence from the FBI\u2019s investigation of the emails shows that in December 2014, after she turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department, Clinton\u2019s aides told the company that managed the server to delete the rest of the emails. The emails were subpoenaed about three months later, on March 4.  The company didn\u2019t actually do the deletion until later in March, but there\u2019s been no evidence that Clinton knew about the delay at the time or that the company knew the messages were under subpoena.  In any case, the FBI declined to recommend prosecution, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion that Clinton committed \u201creal crimes.\u201d  A poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University asked Americans if they believe Trump is honest. By 62% to 34%, a majority said no.  12:30 p.m.: This article was updated with comments by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.",

Haskell resigned, along with two more high level executives.  Mund is speaking out about the controversy for the first time in an interview to CNN. She also discussed the organization\u2019s future with former Miss America Gretchen Carlson now at the helm, her support for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations.  What went through your mind when you read the leaked emails?  \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and I kept thinking, what was said about me? That shouldn\u2019t be the first thing I have to worry about, but then I knew at the same time there are all these young girls looking up [to me], and I\u2019m there to uphold morale, and I\u2019m there to let them know that the future of Miss America, we\u2019ve got another 100 years after this. It\u2019s difficult, you never want to have that said about yourself, about your fellow sisters but you can just get stronger from it.\u201d  Gretchen Carlson, former Miss America 1989, has been tapped to run the organization and essentially turn things around. What are your thoughts on her as the new leader?  \u201cGrowing up, I was always admiring different Miss Americas but I think Gretchen Carlson has always been one of my favorites because she is a well-educated woman. She went to Stanford. She was from the Midwest, just like me. I think it\u2019s great to have a female in the role leading a women\u2019s empowerment organization. I think she is highly qualified for the job. She\u2019s going to be able to push us further on, and I can\u2019t wait to see where Miss America is going to go next.\u201d  How do you make sure things like that don\u2019t happen again within an organization like Miss America?  \u201cI think accountability. What\u2019s amazing is that this organization is there to empower women. At the end of the day, it was the Miss Americas who had the courage to stand up and say this wasn\u2019t right, we need to change this. The mission of the organization \u2026 came full circle and we are giving women that power to take back what\u2019s theirs.\u201d  You are at a pivotal time, representing the country as a strong female leader in the midst of a national reckoning. Have you thought about how you\u2019ll use your platform to support the #MeToo movement?  \u201cThis is so important as Miss America that I serve as a voice for those that may not be heard \u2026 I\u2019m here to say we need to stand in solidarity. We need to support these women. There\u2019s other women out there that haven\u2019t had the opportunity to be heard, but we are going to make sure we do something to change what\u2019s going on \u2026 I\u2019m not just here to wear a crown and sash and smile and wave, but I\u2019m here to make an impact. I\u2019m going to do what I can \u2013 if that\u2019s lobbying on Congress, if that\u2019s testifying, whatever it is that I need to do.\u201d  You\u2019ve said you\u2019d like to run for political office one day?  \u201cI would love to be the first female governor of North Dakota. I would just love to see equal representation between men and women in Congress. Issues that are going on right now are things that are affecting both genders and when I sat at the State of the Union, I remember looking out and I was having a hard time finding the women. Women only represent about 20 percent [of Congress] and we are equal in population. So, I don\u2019t know why we aren\u2019t having our voice heard at an equal level.\u201d  You\u2019re from a state that nearly all voted for Donald Trump, is there a misconception in the media of \u2018Trump Country\u2019?  \u201cI think at the end of the day, we are all similar more than we are different. Before we are Republicans or Democrats, we are Americans. We all have this goal of making our country the best that we can.\u201d  What are your thoughts on Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall?  \u201cI don\u2019t think the issue of immigration is necessarily a structural one. I think it\u2019s a political one, and I think it would be a waste of funding. There are so many other issues in the United States that could use that funding, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to solve the problem by just building a wall.\u201d  What are your thoughts on same sex marriage?  \u201cI don\u2019t think who you love can be determined by a piece of legislation. It\u2019s not a legislative issue. It\u2019s a personal issue, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a governing body to tell you who you can and cannot love.\u201d  Would you like to add or take away a portion of the Miss America pageant?  \u201cI would like to see is more of the interview portion featured on the telecast.\u201d  This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",

His remarks were from a radio conversation with Sirius XM's Salena Zito on Monday morning.  \"I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a really tough person, but he had a big heart,\" Trump said, despite the fact that Jackson was behind Native American removal, the Trail of Tears and owned about 150 slaves.  \"He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this,'\" Trump added. Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War began in 1861.  \"People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?,\" he added, seeming to forget the basic curriculum of an American history class. \"People don't ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?\" Hint: slavery. Another hint: \"states' rights.\"  Listen to the exchange here:  The quote sent Twitter in a frenzy. Here's what some people had to say:",

Trump stated that if Jackson had been a little later, the Civil War would not have happened. He described Jackson as a \"really tough person, but he had a big heart.\" Despite the fact that Jackson was responsible for the removal of Native Americans, the Trail of Tears, and owning about 150 slaves, Trump's comments caused an uproar on Twitter. Some users expressed their outrage, while others defended Trump's right to express his opinions.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN reported that a scandal had rocked the Miss America organization, after emails were leaked from the organization's CEO, Sam Haskell, in which he made derogatory comments about former winners of the pageant based on their weight and sexual activity. Haskell resigned, along with two other high-level executives. Miss America Cara Mund, who had been crowned just over three months ago, spoke out about the controversy for the first time in an interview with CNN. She also discussed the organization's future with former Miss America Gretchen Carlson, who is now leading the organization. Mund expressed her support for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations.\n\nIn response to the controversy, Carlson emphasized the importance of accountability and the organization's mission to empower women. She stated that the Miss Americas had the courage to stand up and say that the organization needed to change, and that the mission came full circle. Carlson is committed to turning things around and ensuring that the organization continues to support women.\n\nMund also discussed the importance of the Miss America pageant and its role in empowering young women. She emphasized the need for more interview portion on the telecast, and that the pageant serves as a platform for women to make an impact. Mund is also committed to using her platform to support the #MeToo movement and advocate for women's rights.\n\nFinally, Mund discussed her political aspirations and the misconception of \"Trump Country\" in the media. She emphasized that all Americans share a common goal of making their country the best it can, regardless of their political affiliation. Mund also expressed her support for same-sex marriage and believes that who one loves should not be determined by legislation.\n\nOverall, the Miss America pageant has faced numerous controversies in recent years, and the recent scandal highlights the need for greater accountability and transparency. With Carlson leading the organization, it remains to be seen how the pageant will continue to empower women and promote positive change.",

The resignation of its Executive Chairman and Chief Executive, Sam Haskell, who was suspended from the organization Friday as he was put under investigation, will be effective immediately, according to a statement from interim chairman Dan Meyers.  The board further accepted the resignation of chairman Lynn Weidner along with President and Chief Operating Officer Josh Randle. The two will remain in their current positions for several more weeks to \"facilitate a smooth transition,\" according to Meyers' statement.  The organization said its board of directors accepted Randle's resignation Saturday \"in light of recent events and new developments.\"  \u25ba Friday:Miss America CEO Sam Haskell suspended over offensive emails  \u25ba Friday:131 so far accused of sexual misconduct in 'Harvey Weinstein effect'  The Miss America Organization was rocked following the release of internal emails published Thursday on Huffington Post. The published messages showed offensive language Haskell used to describe 2013 Miss America Mallory Hagan \u2014 describing her as \"fat and gross\" in one note.  In another exchange from August 2014, Haskell received an email that said Hagan\u2019s hairdresser had been commenting on Hagan\u2019s sex life as well as her recent weight gain.  Haskell forwarded the email to Miss America telecast lead writer Lewis Friedman and noted, \u201cNot a single day passes that I am not told some horrible story about Mallory.\u201d  Friedman replied, \u201cMallory\u2019s preparing for her new career \u2026 as a blimp in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade. As she continues to destroy her own credibility, her voice will attract less and less notice while she continues her descent to an unhappy pathetic footnote.\u201d  Friedman ended the email with this: \u201cP.S.

The story is so unkind and untrue, and hurts me, my family, and the stewardship of this non-profit.\"  Hagan was among dozens of former Miss Americas who signed a petition, which Miss North Carolina 1991 Jennifer Vaden Barth started Friday, calling on the group's leadership to step down. The petition called the emails from Haskell and others \u201cdespicable\u201d and faulted officials who \u201csat by without objection while such derisive comments were passed around.\u201d  On Jan. 25, 2015, Haskell forwarded a photo of Hagan with three other former Miss Americas to Randle and said, \u201cLook at MH in this photo...OMG,\" the Huffington Post reported.  Randle reportedly replied, \u201cShe\u2019s a healthy one!! Hahaha.\u201d  \u25ba Sept. 11:Miss Texas slams Trump's Charlottesville comments  \u25ba Sept. 10:Miss North Dakota Cara Mund takes Miss America crown  On Saturday, Randle told The Associated Press that his comment responding to an email to his private account about Hagan's physical appearance came months before he started working for the Miss America Organization in 2015. But he said it was wrong.  \u201cI apologize to Mallory for my lapse in judgment,\u201d Randle said. \u201cIt does not reflect my values or the values I worked to promote at the Miss America Organization. Although this terrible situation was not caused or driven by me, in light of recent events and new developments, I am no longer willing to continue in my capacity as president and earlier today offered my resignation to the MAO Board of Directors.  \u201cI feel terrible, but this is the right thing to do,\u201d he said.  \u25ba Sept. 9:Road for Miss Missouri, first openly gay contestant, to pageant  \u25ba Sept. 8:Miss Louisiana wins swimsuit competition on Night 2  Randle said his resignation was voluntary and the board of Miss America, based in Atlantic City, N.J., had not requested it. In May at age 29, Randle became the youngest president of the Miss America organization in its history.  Haskell joined Miss America\u2019s board in 2005 after retiring from the William Morris Agency, now called WME, where he was the worldwide head of television.  Gretchen Carlson, 1989 Miss America, tweeted a statement from herself and Kate Shindle, 1998 Miss America, Saturday calling the resignations \"reassuring\" but adding \"this by no means fulfills the need for a thorough housecleaning of the Board.\"  \"We will continue to demand the resignations of every individual who either participated in the abuse of women or stood by and was complicit,\" the statement said.

Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\" But the president has not used those words himself.  Republicans and Democrats criticized the president for not being more forceful in calling out white nationalists groups.  Trump \u201cmissed an opportunity to be very explicit here,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Fox News Sunday.  The white nationalists \u201cseem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House\u2026 I would urge the president to dissuade them of the [idea] that he is sympathetic to their cause.\u201d  \u201cWe need more from our president on this issue \u2026 it\u2019s up to him to correct the record here,\" Graham said.  Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, was one of the first Republicans to say Trump needed to \"call evil by its name\" Saturday.  \"This president has done an incredible job of naming terrorism around the globe as evil., radical Islamic terrorism ... he has said and called it out time and time again and this president needs to do exactly that today, call this white supremacy, white nationalism evil,\u201d Gardner said on CNN State of the Union Sunday. \"Let the country hear it and let the world hear it. It's something that needs to come from the Oval Office.\"  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have recommended that statement. I think he needed to be much harsher as it related to the white supremacists,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, Trump\u2019s former communications director, on ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cIt\u2019s actually terrorism, whether it\u2019s domestic or international terrorism with the moral authority of the presidency you have to call that stuff out.\u201d  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged the president to say \"white supremacy is an affront to American values.\"  As of Sunday morning Trump had still not specifically condemned white nationalism.  \"The president has been very clear, we cannot tolerate this kind of bigotry, this kind of hatred. And what he did is he called on all Americans to take a firm stance against it,\" said Trump National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. \"The president called out anyone who is responsible for fomenting this kind of bigotry, hatred, racism and violence.

USA to be crowned the winner of Miss USA, backtracked on her controversial remarks about health care Tuesday. She now says \"it should be a right\" after previously calling it a privilege.  Miss District of Columbia USA Kara McCullough competes during the Miss USA contest Sunday, May 14, 2017, in Las Vegas.  \"I am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right,\" the 25-year-old beauty queen said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.\"  \"I just want people to see where I was coming from. Having a job, I have to look at health care like it is a privilege.\"  McCullough, a chemist who works for the government at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, previously said affordable health care was a \"privilege\" during Sunday's question-and-answer rounds.  \"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege,\" she told host Julianne Hough during the competition. \"As a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs,\" she said at the time. \"So therefore, we need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have health care as well as jobs to all the American citizens worldwide.\"  \"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege.\" Listen to your new #MissUSA talk about healthcare in the USA. pic.twitter.com/CzPBeaTYHO \u2014 Miss USA & Miss Teen USA (@MissUSA) May 15, 2017  The remark ignited political divides over President Donald Trump and the Republican Party's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Trump previously co-owned the Miss Universe Organization, which operates the Miss USA pageant.  McCullough told \"GMA\" Tuesday that she wasn't surprised by online criticisms of her health care comments, or for suggesting she's not a \"feminist\" because she believes women \"are just as equal as men, especially in the workplace.\" She said she prefers the term \"equalism\" to \"feminism.\"  \"I believe that is what America is based on, like having opinions and views,\" she said Tuesday.  \"For me, where I work at with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 'equalism' is more of a term of understanding that no matter your gender, you are still just kind of given the same accolades on your work,\" McCullough said today. \"I believe that if a person does a good job, they should be, you know, credited for that in a sense.\"  McCullough, who was born in Italy and raised in Virginia Beach, succeeded 2016 winner DeShauna Barber, also of the District of Columbia. Barber was the first-ever military member to be crowned Miss USA.  McCullough said she wants to inspire children to pursue careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She graduated with a chemistry degree from South Carolina State University, where she was a member of the Honors College, the American Association of Blacks in Engineering and the Alpha Nu Sigma Honor Society; she also funds program encouraging Science Exploration for Kids.",

It was the president\u2019s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981\u2014then recovering from an attempted assassination.)  Among the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u2014for, it seems, they weren\u2019t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally\u2014as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe\u2019s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast\u2014but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf\u2019s jokes about Trump\u2019s wealth (\u201cMr. President, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you\u2019re doing fine\u201d) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.  Sanders was reportedly seated in Wolf\u2019s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: \u201cI loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Wolf said to her. \u201cI\u2019m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what\u2019s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.\u201d  The New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders\u2019s seeming gameness for taking the criticism\u2014\u201cThat @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,\u201d she wrote on Twitter\u2014a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf\u2019s speech), said, \u201cWashington is so thin-skinned.\u201d (She would know.) Celebrities like Rosie O\u2019Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf\u2019s performance\u2014though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.  But there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf\u2019s own, in response to Sean Spicer\u2019s tweet that \u201cTonight\u2019s #WHCD was a disgrace.\u201d \u201cThank you!\u201d she responded.

        "doc_1_text": "There is \u2013 and perhaps there always will be \u2013 a dedicated group of people who don\u2019t know Hillary Clinton personally, but nonetheless hate her.  Whether they are truly a \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d (as Clinton called them in 1998) or just many in number and conservative in outlook, there\u2019s no arguing that they exist or that they continue to try to influence public opinion on the Democratic nominee.    But even if people consider themselves savvy enough to reject the strangest conspiracy theories (sample claims include that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian faking her 40-year marriage, a member of the Illuminati and/or an agent of the devil himself), there seems little doubt that an undercurrent of hostility spanning decades has had an impact upon how she is viewed.  Clinton\u2019s unfavorability rating may not be as low as Donald Trump\u2019s, but in an election year which has frequently degenerated into name-calling, she has attracted invective from both the left and the right. Polls have frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d epithet.  Her links to Wall Street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. But the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.  Craig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, said that, when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington DC as first lady, \u201cshe came from Little Rock with a reputation already established\u201d as \u201csuch a militant feminist, difficult to deal with\u201d.  He noted that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, because she kept her maiden name.\u201cHere she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale,\u201d Shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, \u201cdown to Little Rock and brings her attitudes with her\u201d.  There\u2019s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people Craig Shirley, conservative political consultant  So by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be \u2013 a potential liability to her husband\u2019s political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly.    And, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. First, there was her much-maligned \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette\u201d comment in response to a reporter\u2019s assertion that she and her husband had \u201csome sort of understanding and arrangement\u201d about his infidelity.  Then, her out-of-context \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies\u201d comment, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.  And then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she\u2019d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and Travelgate, in which she \u2013 contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the president\u2019s staff \u2013 was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he arranged.  President Bill Clinton takes his oath of office, accompanied by Hillary Rodham Clinton, in 1993. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock  The key question raised about Whitewater and Travelgate was not whether Clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal means to try to keep the media from finding out.

        "generated_text": "President Trump's controversial speech at the 2017 Boy Scout Jamboree has sparked widespread criticism, with some comparing it to a \"political rally.\" During the speech, Trump attacked Obamacare, called for greater loyalty, and recounted his election night. He also repeated his claims against \"fake media\" and \"fake news,\" despite saying he would put that aside. The speech was met with applause and chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\", but also boos for comments about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The Boy Scouts of America said that the invitation for Trump to visit the National Jamboree was a long-standing tradition and not an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.\n\nThis event highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding Trump's relationship with the media and his criticism of political opponents, particularly Hillary Clinton. Clinton has faced decades of hostility and personal attacks, which have shaped public opinion about her. Although her unfavorability rating may not be as low as Trump's, she has attracted invective from both the left and the right in the 2016 election. Polls have cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the \"Crooked Hillary\" epithet. The roots of hostility towards Clinton go deeper than just political differences, with some seeing her as untrustworthy and unfeminine. Craig Shirley, a conservative political consultant and Ronald Reagan biographer, noted that Clinton faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor because she kept her maiden name. The press corps had an established narrative of Clinton as a potential liability to her husband's political career, and she provided them plenty of material to support that narrative. The media's expectations, television, and societal norms shape people's attitudes towards Clinton, and there is some misogyny in that, according to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton's administration. While it is rare for people to compare a male politician they do not like to their father, Clinton reminds people of their mothers or the schoolteacher they didn't like, Kamarck noted.",

The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group\u2019s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group\u2019s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization\u2019s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  \u201cThe board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.\u201d  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board\u2019s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.  \u201cAt this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,\u201d Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. \u201cThey have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.\u201d  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  \u201cThe board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,\u201d she told the AP late Wednesday. \u201cThey need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.\u201d  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members \u201cwill begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,\u201d a statement from the board read.  There are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.  The organization hopes to have the nominations in hand by Jan. 3. The board said it was notifying groups of its decision to seek their help late Wednesday night.  The emails already cost the pageant its television production partner and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City\u2019s Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year. Dick Clark Productions told the AP last Thursday that it cut ties with the Miss America Organization over the emails, calling them \u201cappalling.\u201d  Meyers said the group has spoken with ABC, the television network scheduled to broadcast the September 2018 pageant, as well as with pageant sponsors. None has ended its relationship with the Miss America Organization, he said. Independent messages sent by the AP over the past two days seeking comment from ABC and pageant sponsors have gone unanswered.",

Reality television star and President Donald Trump\u2019s employee, Omarosa Manigault was rushed to the hospital after suffering a leg injury, according to a new report, Feb. 3.

Omarosa Manigault, 42, was rushed to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland on Feb. 3, to be treated for a prior injury to left her leg, according to TMZ. She was transported to the Maryland medical center via a government vehicle, and it is unclear if she was inside the White House when she needed medical attention.  Omarosa was actually injured last month [Jan. 2017], and her leg was placed in a walking boot, as reported by the site. She was actually seen leaving The View, Jan. 27, wearing the orthopedic boot. Omarosa was apparently taken to the hospital for her existing injury. However, it\u2019s unclear what exactly happened.  The television personality was on President Donald Trump\u2018s [70] Celebrity Apprentice on the show\u2019s first season in the spring of 2004. Unfortunately she was fired after nine weeks on the show. After remaining close with Trump, Omarosa now serves as assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liason in the White House. Before Trump\u2019s Nov. 2016 election victory, Omarosa worked for his presidential campaign as his director of African-American outreach.  In the photo [above] that Omarosa posted to her Twitter Feb. 1, she was sitting around a table inside the White House for President Trump\u2019s meeting to honor Black History Month. During the meeting the President gushed over Omarosa and how \u201cspecial\u201d she was.  \u201cI want to thank my television star over here \u2014 Omarosa\u2019s actually a very nice person. Nobody knows that,\u201d Trump said during the \u201cget-together\u201d that Ben Carson, 65, was present for. \u201cI don\u2019t want to destroy her reputation. She is a very good person and she\u2019s been helpful right from the beginning with the campaign and I appreciate it, I really do. Very special. So I want to thank everybody for being here.\u201d  Omarosa\u2019s position in Trump\u2019s White House is surprising to some since she declared support for Hillary Clinton, 69, back in 2014. And, this isn\u2019t her first time inside the White House \u2014 Omarosa worked for former Vice President Al Gore, 68, during President Bill Clinton\u2018s [70] administration [1993-2001].

In a sit-down interview with Variety published on Tuesday, Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter\u2019s foray into politics, which began with a phone call from Trump and culminated in a meeting between the two at the White House in May.  \u201cI thought they did the right thing,\u201d Jenner, 68, told the trade magazine of the mother of three, whom she has not spoken to in years. \u201cI was very proud of her.\u201d  Jenner herself is \u201cvery politically involved\u201d and has been busy working to shape policy in the Trump administration, though more so behind the scenes.  \u201cI don\u2019t do a lot of media. I don\u2019t want to be seen everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don\u2019t stick my nose into everything publicly.\u201d  Jon Kopaloff/WireImage; Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock  A long outspoken Republican, Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 election on what she thought was a promise of continued progress for LGBTQ rights.  \u201cOn the economics side, I\u2019m very conservative. I believe in limited government, I believe in lower taxes, I believe in less regulations, I want a thriving economy, I want Americans to be able to succeed,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cBut socially, I\u2019m much more progressive. We have to get them to be more progressive with social issues. It\u2019s their biggest problem.\u201d  But since Trump\u2019s election, there\u2019s been an attempt to roll back rights \u2014 including Trump\u2019s failed attempt to stop transgender people from enrolling in the military and his move to lift federal protections for transgender students that would guarantee their freedom to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their chosen gender identity.  \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what happened when he got in there,\u201d Jenner remarked. \u201cIt was extraordinarily disappointing.\u201d  Though she hasn\u2019t spoken to Trump since his election (despite publicly asking the president to call her), Jenner explained that she regularly makes trips to Washington, D.C. and has had long meetings with roughly 50 members of the House and Senate and many members of Trump\u2019s White House directly.  \u201cI met with Paul Ryan. I\u2019ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren\u2019t supportive of transgender rights. \u2026 I\u2019ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,\u201d she said, telling Variety that the conversations were confidential but often included \u201cinvasive questions about her body and genitalia.\u201d  \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m on the Republican side because I\u2019ve got an in,\u201d she said. \u201cHas this administration set us backwards? Absolutely. And every time they\u2019ve done it, I\u2019ve fought it. \u2026. I fight those types of wars. I fight the equality wars. I do it all very quietly. We\u2019re going to be okay in the end.\u201d  She added: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Washington D.C. is just disgraceful. The hate, the media, all the things that are going on there. \u2026 [Trump\u2019s] not been doing a very good job, but it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack    Because Jenner\u2019s advocacy for transgender rights on Capitol Hill has been mostly behind the scenes, many members of the LGBTQ community have felt frustrated that she hasn\u2019t been using her celebrity and influence to help.  That criticism has caused Jenner to feel isolation from her own community. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it big time, and it hurts,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes this community can be really tough.\u201d  \u201cNo matter what you say or do, they think you don\u2019t get it because you\u2019re this kind of white, privileged person,\u201d Jenner confessed, disputing any notion that she isn\u2019t an advocate. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my back on anybody. \u2026 We need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality. It\u2019s going to take some time, but we\u2019re working on it.\u201d",

Jenner has also been criticized for not using her platform to speak out against the rollback of LGBTQ rights under the Trump administration.\n\nJenner has been a long-time critic of Trump and has been tweeting at him for years. In February, she bragged to USA Today that she had been trolling Mr. Trump for \"five to seven years.\" That included tweets like \"You are 71 f**king years old. Grow. The f**k. Up,\" and \"You are a national embarrassment. It's like you have no idea how to even fake being a normal human being. You are the proud type of insane.\" However, on Sunday, Mr. Trump tweeted that \"It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President,\" and Teigen responded, \"Lolllllll no one likes you.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Teigen tweeted that she had been blocked \"after 9 years of hating Donald J Trump.\" That includes tweets from Teigen to Mr. Trump like \"You are 71 f**king years old. Grow. The f**k. Up,\" and \"You are a national embarrassment. It's like you have no idea how to even fake being a normal human being. You are the proud type of insane.\" Teigen's Twitter account is one of several the president has apparently blocked. Author Stephen King also posted a tongue-in-cheek comment when he was blocked from reading Mr. Trump's tweets, saying \"Trump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself.\"\n\nIn mid-July, a group of Twitter users blocked by Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit against him and two White House aides, claiming that the president's Twitter account serves as a public forum, which would make it illegal for Mr. Trump, as a government official, to prevent individuals from reading it. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that being blocked from the president's Twitter account is similar to being barred from a public forum, and a violation of the First Amendment. They also cited their right to read government statements from the president's Twitter account.",

Now the organization\u2019s flagship program \u2014 long known as the Boy Scouts \u2014 has a new name to promote the message. And it\u2019s missing the word \u201cboy.\u201d Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Beginning in February 2019, it will be known as Scouts BSA.  \u201cScouts BSA perfectly represents the new, inclusive program for older Scouts that the Boy Scouts of America is proud to offer,\u201d said Effie Delimarkos, a spokeswoman.  Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh told the Associated Press that many names were considered and that the ultimate goal was \u201cto land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward.\u201d Surbaugh said he expects that kids enrolled in Scouts BSA would refer to themselves just as \u201cscouts,\u201d without \u201cgirl\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d identifiers.  Advertisement  In October, Boy Scouts of America announced it would allow girls into the Cub Scouts program, a step in allowing them to earn the coveted Eagle Scout ranking. So far, 3,000 girls have joined roughly 170 Cub Scout packs in the first rollout of the new policy. Scouts BSA will begin admitting female members next year.  Also on Wednesday, Scouts BSA announced a new campaign for the Cub Scouts, \u201cScout Me In,\u201d that features female Cub Scouts.  The organization has been forced to find new ways of bringing kids and their families into scouting, especially as its membership has dropped by about a third since 2000. But the changes also reflect shifting social and cultural norms that expect programs to be equally available to boys and girls.  Still, Girl Scouts of the USA, a separate organization, which has opposed efforts by Boy Scouts of America to recruit girls to its ranks, said the name change was not much more than that \u2014 noting that it came without any new girl-focused programming.  Advertisement  \u201cWe proudly own the \u2018Girl\u2019 in Girl Scouts,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cSince our inception, Girl Scouts of the USA have been about putting girls front and center, ensuring that everything we do is not only with their best interests in mind but equips them to be the fearless leaders and change makers who our 50 million alumnae prove to be.\u201d  Share this article Share  Scouts BSA, the program for 11-to-17-year-olds, will stay divided along gender lines. Single-sex troops will have the chance to work toward the Eagle Scout rank.  Surbaugh told the AP that having separate units for boys and girls would address concerns that girls joining the program for the first time might start off behind in the long climb to leadership opportunities.  The group\u2019s umbrella organization will still be called Boy Scouts of America, and the program for younger children will keep the Cub Scouts moniker.  Advertisement  Some were not impressed with the new name. One Twitter user wrote that \u201cpolitical correctness ruins everything in life. It destroys even the most innocent of institutions.\u201d Another wrote that \u201cBoys belong in BOY scouts. Girls belong in GIRL Scouts.\u201d  The Boy Scouts of America has more than 2.4 million youth participants and nearly 1 million adult volunteers, according to its website.  In 2013, the Boy Scouts ended its prohibition on openly gay youths. Two years later, it said it would allow gay scout leaders as well.  In January 2017, the Boy Scouts said it would allow transgender children to join its programs.  \u201cAs we enter a new era for our organization, it is important that all youth can see themselves in Scouting in every way possible,\u201d Delimarkos said.

Naturally, the conversation turned to President Trump \u2014 whom Baldwin hopes doesn\u2019t get to serve a second term.  Baldwin \u2014 whose portrayal of Trump on Saturday Night Live has drawn Twitter criticism from the president himself but has earned the actor an Emmy \u2014 told Stern, \u201cI can only think of a couple people who I think could beat Trump.\u201d When Stern suggested that Baldwin should run for the Oval Office in 2020, the actor confidently replied, \u201cIf I ran, I would win. I would absolutely win. I 1,000 percent would win.\u201d  However, Baldwin said an official bid is highly unlikely because of his hosting duties on ABC\u2019s Match Game revival. Plus, his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, \u201cwould kill\u201d him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do Match Game! The presidency of the United States or Match Game?\u201d he jokingly asked Stern. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d  Baldwin then slipped into his caricature of Trump and revealed his plans to take the summer off should he ever be elected. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take the summer off and be like, \u2018Listen everybody, I\u2019m going to East Hampton to relax. Howard and I have to go to Nick & Toni\u2019s,'\u201d he said, garnering laughter from Stern.  When Stern brought up the idea of Baldwin running for president as Trump, the 30 Rock alum doubled down on his prior statement: \u201cIf I ran for president, I would win! Hands down, I would win. It would be the funniest, most exciting, most crazy campaign.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re the hope of the Democratic Party,\u201d Stern said, to which Baldwin quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d  He elaborated: \u201cThe only reason I say that is because I\u2019d love to run for that position to just have things be very common sense. There\u2019s so many things that this country needs to do that are so obvious.\u201d  During his chat with Stern, Baldwin emphasized that he\u2019d like to \u201csee a healthy\u201d Republican Party. \u201cI don\u2019t want [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi to run everything either,\u201d Baldwin said of the California Democrat. \u201cI want the Democrats to have a smart opposition to keep them on their toes.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019d like to see the Republican Party get back to [John McCain or Mitt Romney],\u201d he explained to Stern. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that this thing with Trump is a one-off.\u201d  Still, Baldwin believes Trump\u2019s election has had a negative impact on the way Americans view potential candidates. \u201cWe buy the presidency now \u2014 we vote for the president \u2014 like we buy gum or laundry soap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all jingoism and all this marketing.\u201d  Baldwin also offered a \u201ctheory\u201d about Trump\u2019s history-making summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \u201cYou can almost see Trump\u2019s people saying to Kim Jong Un\u2019s people, \u2018We don\u2019t really care if you get rid of the nukes.

Let me go home and say what I need to say to get reelected.'\u201d  Baldwin has hinted that he might be done playing Trump on SNL.

        "doc_1_text": "Not since Alicia Machado became the breakout star of the first presidential debate seven months ago\u2014that\u2019s half a century in Trump news cycle years\u2014have the disparate worlds of pageantry and politics been so intertwined. K\u00e1ra McCullough, our new reigning Miss USA, sparked controversy during Sunday night\u2019s crowning due to her polarizing opinions on two separate issues: feminism and health care. Unlike so many of our elected politicians, McCullough\u2019s soundbites were definitive, articulate, and to the point. But it was the content of McCullough\u2019s politics, not her delivery, that left viewers sounding off on social media well into Monday morning. To recap, Miss District of Columbia became an unconventional alt-right darling by insisting that health care is a privilege, not a right. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to say it is a privilege,\u201d McCullough offered during the 30-second question and answer portion of the pageant. \u201cAs a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that to have health care, you need to have jobs.\u201d  Much to the chagrin of Twitter eggs everywhere, the 25-year-old McCullough has since clarified her position on health care, explaining on Good Morning America that, \u201cI am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right, and I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.\u201d But McCullough is less likely to backtrack on her other controversial opinion of the night\u2014the revelation that she self-identifies not as a feminist, but as an equalist. \u201cI try not to consider myself this die-hard, like, I don\u2019t really care about men,\u201d she infamously insisted on Sunday night\u2019s broadcast. During a victory tour interview at the top of New York\u2019s Empire State Building, a wind-blown McCullough (complete with sash and crown) doubles down on her decision to identify as an equalist. \u201cI\u2019m just about being equal,\u201d McCullough tells The Daily Beast, before insisting that, \u201cI\u2019m all about women\u2019s rights.\u201d  As a scientist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a degree in radiochemistry, McCullough has experience succeeding in a traditionally male-dominated field. In fact, she\u2019s consistently spoken out about the importance of supporting women and girls in STEM, a platform that, for many, made her reluctance to call herself a feminist even more surprising. Still, McCullough insists, \u201cI do want to see women flourish in just every aspect of life, whether it is in the medical sciences, or whether it\u2019s in the government agencies and in STEM. I\u2019m just saying in total we have to look at ourselves as, \u2018we are equal.\u2019\u201d McCullough pauses and smiles before reaching for a pageant conclusion: \u201cWomen have made so many strides, and I\u2019m looking forward to this next generation of women coming up.\u201d  Equalism aside, McCullough has been heralded as an outstanding role model on multiple fronts: not just as a black female scientist, but as a pageant beauty who insists on wearing her natural curls. McCullough concedes that in a time when images of natural black hair are still under-represented in pop culture, her decision was, of course, a deliberate one. \u201cWhen I came to the conclusion to wear my hair natural, I wanted to be authentic,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I feel the most liberated and happy with my natural curly hair. Typically, you don\u2019t really see women on the pageant stage with their natural hair. You\u2019re always told to straighten your hair, that it looks more professional, it looks more put together.\u201d McCullough stops just short of explaining the racism intrinsic to this particular brand of pageant advice\u2014we are at an Empire State Building press junket, after all\u2014and chooses her next words carefully. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily trying to challenge the status quo,\u201d she continues. \u201cI just wanted to be comfortable. And that\u2019s the message that I want to send to so many young women: do what makes you comfortable.\u201d  Ten years ago, Miss USA would most likely be answering questions about her exercise routine or her favorite home-cooked meal. But, perhaps given the pageant\u2019s history as a part of Donald Trump\u2019s extensive entertainment portfolio, politics appear to have become a part of the competition. McCullough seems up to the challenge of wearing the crown during one of the most turbulent political moments in recent memory. In fact, she\u2019s excited that Sunday\u2019s Miss USA amounted to more than just channel surfing fodder. \u201cWe\u2019re starting a conversation!\u201d She exclaims. \u201cWe\u2019re pressing on issues that are prominent in our nation right now\u2026Everyone has an opinion, and I\u2019m glad.\u201d  McCullough insists that while \u201cI don\u2019t have a political agenda, I\u2019m not trying to be a politician,\u201d she\u2019s open to using her platform to discuss more political issues in the future. \u201cIf matters are pressing on my heart, and I feel as if I\u2019m the one involved in that type of situation, then sure, I\u2019ll speak out about it,\u201d she offers, before concluding that, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to go with the flow.\u201d  As for her personal reaction to all of the backlash her pageant responses elicited, from doting conservatives to disappointed liberals, our reigning Miss USA has a perfectly patriotic answer: \u201cThat\u2019s what social media\u2019s about, and that\u2019s what America\u2019s about.\u201d Land of freedom of expression, and home of the tweets.",

This decision was met with widespread criticism from celebrities and environmentalists alike.\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore called the decision \"reckless and indefensible.\" In a statement, Gore said, \"It undermines America's standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity's ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake: if President Trump won't lead, the American people will.\" Leonardo DiCaprio, who previously addressed world leaders to join the Paris Agreement, voiced his disappointment on Twitter and urged others to take action.\n\nLeonard Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, announced his departure from Trump's advisory councils upon the announcement. \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" he tweeted.\n\nActor Kal Penn, who worked in the White House Office of Public Engagement under the Obama administration, prompted activism. \"Don't just get mad at the dummies, do something about it!\" he tweeted.\n\nJon Favreau, Obama's former chief speechwriter, pointed out potential reasoning for Trump's decision. \"Coulter is at least honest for the reason Trump made this decision: to piss off the left,\" he tweeted.\n\nOther celebrities also took to social media to express their opinions on the decision. Ava DuVernay summed up her thoughts in just one word: \"Shameful.\" Bette Midler took aim at the press for the decision she called \"destructive.\" Neil deGrasse Tyson took a jab at Trump's entire administration.\n\nThe decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace, according to Bernie Sanders. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City also expressed his commitment to meeting the standards set forth in the Paris Accord.\n\nOverall, celebrities and environmentalists alike condemned President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.",

Here is Roberts' full statement:  \"We are appalled that this language was displayed on our site. This product description was provided by a third-party seller via our self-service platform. Regardless, this is completely unacceptable and violates our policies -- to say nothing of our values. When made aware of the issue, we immediately removed the deal -- as well as the third-party seller -- from our marketplace.

It was an apocalyptic year: 2012, end of the Mayan calendar and of the Twilight film franchise. Breaking Dawn \u2014 Part 2 hit theaters on November 16. Two days before, the future president of the United States tweeted this:  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/268416910595600384  And four days before that, he tweeted this:  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266972430638137344  Two weeks before that, he tweeted this:  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/260814133690249217  And the day before that, he tweeted this:  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/260482827458592768  Four days before that, he tweeted this:  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258966137302315009  And this!  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258937466155831297  And the day before that, he tweeted this.  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720  Thanks to the magic of social media and his own obsession with press coverage, the American people have access to a rich archive of our president\u2019s unseemly fixations. Trump\u2019s brief obsession with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ranks alongside his diatribe about his predecessor\u2019s gum-chewing habit as the strangest of these. What drove him to tweet seven times about the breakup of America\u2019s sweethearts? Why did he seem so desperate for Pattinson\u2019s friendship? And what did the subjects of his sweaty speculation think of all this?  Until now, like the great philosophical inquiries, all of these questions were virtually unanswerable. Today, those of us who care about these things got some long-awaited insight into one of them, at least. That\u2019s because a noble reporter at Entertainment Weekly had the good sense to ask Pattinson about it. Unfortunately, Pattinson\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t particularly revealing:  Does it seem somewhat surreal that the current president of the United States once wrote a bunch of tweets about you?  [Laughs] I think there\u2019s so many different levels of it. Your identity exists on many different planes at the same time and they all can be quite different from each other. When he said that, it didn\u2019t really mean anything. But I guess now I\u2019m sort of thinking, like, \u201cWell, I guess that is related to me.\u201d But how does that fit in with all the other things going on in my life? And sometimes you think, \u201cCan I use this in my acting? Or should I be putting it away.\u201d It\u2019s kind of interesting, I guess. I don\u2019t know \u2014 this could be why people get annoyed with me.  Now all we need to do is pick the brain of MEAT BALL\u2019S GHOST, the guy who used the RPatz/KStew tweets to predict Trump\u2019s presidency.  https://twitter.com/GHOSTofMEATBALL/status/258641295487156224",

However, the mystery surrounding these tweets was solved when Entertainment Weekly interviewed Pattinson, who revealed that the tweets didn't mean much to him at the time and that he wasn't particularly surprised by them.\n\nMeanwhile, Groupon faced a backlash after a series of listings for winter boots used a racial slur to describe the color of the shoe. Customers shared screenshots of the posts on social media, and many vowed to boycott the online marketplace due to the offensive language. Groupon spokesperson explained that the language used was from a third party seller and that they were \"Chinese-based enterprises.\" The company apologized for the incident and promised to make improvements to their self-service platform.\n\nThese incidents highlight the president's fixation on trivial matters and the need for companies to be more vigilant in monitoring their platforms for offensive language.

It was overwhelming,\u201d said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to \u201cbe masculine\u201d and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a \u201ctyranny by the minority.\u201d  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the \u201cnew director\u201d of the Academy\u2019s \u201cminority outreach program.\u201d  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her \u201cgoal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.\u201d  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state\u2019s 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California\u2019s 43rd District.  \u201cAfter much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,\u201d Dash said in her statement. \u201cI believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.\u201d  She added that she knows her \u201cpolitical positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable.\u201d",

(Video: Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)  Share Add to your saved stories Save  Cats. They care not for your affection, your familiar voice or perhaps even for your overall existence. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight And they certainly don\u2019t care about your career as a respected academic or any fancy television interviews taking place in your office. Polish historian Jerzy Targalski discovered this during an on-camera appearance on a Dutch news program when his cat unceremoniously climbed atop his head in the middle of the interview.  Targalski was speaking with a journalist from the Dutch public television station Nieuwsuur to weigh in on \u201cthe controversial forced removal of Polish top judge Malgorzata Gersdorf\u201d by the country\u2019s ruling conservative party, according to NTR reporter Rudy Bouma.  Partway through the taping, his orange tabby began pawing and mewing at Targalski\u2019s right side. The cat then scaled up the professor\u2019s arm like a personal Everest.

It was both a question and an apologetic statement, directed more to the camera crew and less to the cat, who by this point was already upon his neck.

Targalski smiled and pressed on, with the resignation of a man who has shared his home with a cat and thus knows his place in the feline-human order.  He spoke of the presence of secret-police agents in certain countries and what that means for the political transformation of those countries. But he may as well not have been speaking at all for all the attention his cat was stealing.  As Targalski continued the interview, his cat nuzzled his ear, used his shoulders to get a closer look at a chandelier above and, at one point, curled its tail across Targalski\u2019s face, covering his eyes. The political scientist, who earned his PhD with a thesis titled \u201cMechanisms of dismantling communism in Yugoslavia on the example of Slovenia and Serbia (1986-1991),\u201d simply brushed the cat\u2019s tail away and held it down for several moments to the side of his head.  Advertisement  Alas, none of that footage made it into the final Nieuwsuur segment. Lisio does, however, manage a cameo in the final cut that aired last week (around the 3:50 mark in the video below) in a far less obtrusive manner \u2014 by lying in Targalski\u2019s lap, getting petted as the professor conducts a seated interview.

The VP attended the matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts, a likely humdrum affair between two struggling teams with a combined one win between them. But Pence probably wasn't there to take in the game or honor Trump pal Peyton Manning, who got himself a new statue outside Lucas Oil Stadium this weekend.  SEE ALSO: How to teach your kids about the NFL protests and the awesome power of dissent  Nope. Pence apparently attended to win some cheap political points by leaving the stadium after members of the visiting 49ers knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality and the unequal treatment of minorities in the US. He then tweeted about it.  Pence's reaction was opportunistic, but it also seems to have been a predetermined, calculated decision meant to rile up the Trump-loving political base. Tensions are still high in the wake of a controversy that has gripped all of domestic sports since Donald Trump began attacking protester athletes at an Alabama rally on Sept. 22.  The VP probably knew what he was getting into for the game. The 49ers are the former team of Colin Kaepernick, whose protests in 2016 ignited the current controversy. Kaepernick is currently not on an NFL roster, which many believe is due to his role in the movement.  That hasn't stopped his former teammates and others in the league from continuing (or starting) to kneel and display other forms of dissent during the playing of the anthem. Protests would likely have happened at any game where players weren't encouraged by their owners to link arms or show some other empty form of \"unity\" in the face of Trump's criticism \u2014 but the 49ers connection made it all the more likely.  Pence followed his tweets with an official statement, which was word-for-word what he tweeted:  I left today\u2019s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.  The incorrectly capitalized, jingoistic message is counterintuitive, encapsulating the whole debate around anthem protests succinctly. Pence says that he thinks everyone is entitled to their opinions, but he has zero tolerance for others expressing them in ways he doesn't agree with.  He highlights the \"resolve and resilience\" shown by Americans around the nation, but dismisses the efforts of a large group of citizens steadfastly refusing to allow injustice to be ignored any longer. What he calls an act of disrespect toward the flag and country is, in truth, the exact opposite.  These players have chosen a widely viewed public platform that can carry a message about something that's broken in this country -- and has been for a long time -- to a broad swath of observers. What good is a protest, really, if it's invisible?  After Pence's initial tweets, news emerged making it even more clear that the whole thing was probably a stunt. Vaughn Hillyard of NBC News reported that the press pool with Pence never even left their vans to enter the stadium.  The White House is now handing out photos of Pence standing during the anthem and the whole situation is being treated as a photo op. How very Trumpian.  Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter.  Trump congratulated his number two for winning some of the same cheap political \"victories\" that he himself seems to value most. His assertion that he told Pence ahead of time to leave if any players took a knee essentially confirmed that the early departure was predetermined.  This type of grandstanding shouldn't surprise anyone who has been following the NFL protests or any of the controversies that the Trump administration whipped up in response, but it should be highlighted nonetheless. The VP just wasted an untold amount of taxpayer money (on travel, security detail, etc.) to bring more attention to a divisive, partisan debate.  That's what Senator Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, zeroed in on in his response to the situation.  The Colts-49ers game will go on, and one team will emerge the winner. For the rest of us, however, there are no victors here.",

His assertion that he told Pence ahead of time to leave if any players took a knee essentially confirmed that the early departure was predetermined. This type of grandstanding shouldn't surprise anyone who has been following the NFL protests or any of the controversies that the Trump administration whipped up in response, but it should be highlighted nonetheless. The VP just wasted an untold amount of taxpayer money (on travel, security detail, etc.) to bring more attention to a divisive, partisan debate. That's what Senator Brian Schatz, of Hawaii, zeroed in on in his response to the situation. The Colts-49ers game will go on, and one team will emerge the winner. For the rest of us, however, there are no victors here.",

        "doc_1_text": "In an interview with Channel 4, a British public service television network, American actress Jennifer Lawrence blamed the recent hurricanes on Donald Trump\u2019s voters, because they don\u2019t believe in man-made climate change. During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.  \u201cI mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, \u2018It\u2019s a mad time to be alive.\u2019 And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it. For many people, in America who would say, [grimaces] perhaps it\u2019s truer there at the moment than anywhere else,\u201d the Channel 4 reporter prompted Lawrence to comment.  \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she responded. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s this new language that\u2019s forming, I don\u2019t even recognize it. It\u2019s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,\u201d Lawrence stated.  \u201cAnd you have voted very recently, as a country\u201d the interviewer acknowledged.  \u201cAnd we voted, and it was really startling,\u201d Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were \u201cMother Nature\u2019s rage and wrath\u201d at America for Trump.  \u201cYou know you\u2019re watching these hurricanes now, and it\u2019s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature\u2019s rage and wrath,\u201d she stated.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,\u201d the reporter added.  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I\u2019ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it\u2019s just really confusing,\u201d Lawrence stated.  \u201cDo you find President Trump confusing?\u201d the reporter pressed further.  \u201cI don\u2019t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,\u201d Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.  Wrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future. The Hollywood actress didn\u2019t have much hope with Trump leading the country, calling her recent film a \u201chowl of rage\u201d in response to what\u2019s going on in America:  SUPPORT PRO-LIFE NEWS! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation  \u201cI have to feel hope, you know you have to feel hope. You can\u2019t just fall into despair. But a producer on the movie called this film, \u2018an impotent howl of rage.\u2019 It\u2019s like a helpless howl to the moon, like, it\u2019s just an assault.\u201d  Lawrence has been outspoken about President Trump before he was even president. Back in 2015, she cried that it would be \u201cthe end of the world\u201d if he took office, and told Trump \u201cf**k you\u201d during a 2016 televised talk show appearance. After he won the election, Lawrence penned an open letter to young women on the feminist side Broadly, that the election should \u201cenrage them.\u201d  \u201c[L]ike Hillary, you can still be an inspiration and get important things done. Do not let this defeat you \u2014 let this enrage you! Let it motivate you! Let this be the fire you didn\u2019t have before.

        "doc_1_text": "Source: Gage Skidmore/Creative Commons  The lightning-fast ascent and political invincibility of Donald Trump has left many experts baffled and wondering, \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Any accurate and sufficient answer to that question must not only focus on Trump himself, but also on his uniquely loyal supporters. Given their extreme devotion and unwavering admiration for their highly unpredictable and often inflammatory leader, some have turned to the field of psychology for scientific explanations based on precise quantitative data and established theoretical frameworks.  Although analyses and studies by psychologists and neuroscientists have provided many thought-provoking explanations for his enduring support, the accounts of different experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is apparent that more research and examination is needed to hone in on the exact psychological and social factors underlying this peculiar human behavior.  In a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, Psychologist and UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.  1. Authoritarianism  Authoritarianism refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom and is commonly associated with a lack of concern for the opinions or needs of others. Authoritarian personality syndrome\u2014a well-studied and globally-prevalent condition\u2014is a state of mind that is characterized by belief in total and complete obedience to one\u2019s authority. Those with the syndrome often display aggression toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. The syndrome is often triggered by fear, making it easy for leaders who exaggerate threat or fear monger to gain their allegiance.  Although authoritarian personality is found among liberals, it is more common among the right-wing around the world. President Trump\u2019s speeches, which include absolutist terms like \u201closers\u201d and \u201ccomplete disasters,\u201d are naturally appealing to those who prefer authoritarianism.  While research showed that Republican voters in the U.S. scored higher than Democrats on measures of authoritarianism before Trump emerged on the political scene, a 2016 Politico survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored then-candidate Trump, which led to a correct prediction that he would win the election, despite the polls saying otherwise.  2. Social dominance orientation  Social dominance orientation (SDO)\u2014which is distinct but related to authoritarian personality syndrome\u2014refers to people who have a preference for the societal hierarchy of groups, specifically with a structure in which the high-status groups have dominance over the low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest.  In Trump\u2019s speeches, he appeals to those with SDO by repeatedly making a clear distinction between groups that have a generally higher status in society (White), and those groups that are typically thought of as belonging to a lower status (immigrants and minorities).  A 2016 survey study of 406 American adults published this year in the journal Personality and Individual Differences found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump in the election.  3. Prejudice  It would be grossly unfair and inaccurate to say that every one of Trump\u2019s supporters has a prejudice against ethnic and religious minorities, but it would be equally inaccurate to say that some do not. It is a well-known fact that the Republican party, going at least as far back to Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy,\u201d used strategies that appealed to bigotry, such as by delivering speeches with \u201cdog whistles\u201d\u2014code words that signaled prejudice toward minorities that were designed to be heard by racists but no one else.  While the dog whistles of the past were more subtle, Trump\u2019s are sometimes shockingly direct. There\u2019s no denying that he routinely appeals to bigoted supporters when he calls Muslims \u201cdangerous\u201d and Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers,\u201d often in a blanketed fashion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a new study has shown that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.  4. Intergroup contact  Intergroup contact refers to contact with members of groups that are outside one\u2019s own, which has been experimentally shown to reduce prejudice. As such, it\u2019s important to note that there is growing evidence that Trump\u2019s white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. For example, a 2016 study found that \u201c\u2026the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support.\u201d This correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. In agreement with this finding, the same researchers found that support for Trump increased with the voters\u2019 physical distance from the Mexican border.  5. Relative deprivation  Relative deprivation refers to the experience of being deprived of something to which one believes they are entitled. It is the discontent felt when one compares their position in life to others who they feel are equal or inferior but have unfairly had more success than them.  Common explanations for Trump\u2019s popularity among non-bigoted voters involve economics. There is no doubt that some Trump supporters are simply angry that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China, which is certainly understandable, although these loyalists often ignore the fact that some of these careers may be lost due to the accelerating pace of automation.  These Trump supporters are experiencing relative deprivation, and are common among the swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is specifically referred to as \u201crelative,\u201d as opposed to \u201cabsolute,\u201d because the feeling is often based on a skewed perception of what one is entitled to. For example, an analysis conducted by FiveThirtyEight estimated that the median annual income of Trump supporters was $72,000.  If such data is accurate, the portrayal of most Trump supporters as working-class citizens rebelling against Republican elites may not be fully accurate.

David Ake | The Associated Press) In this June 22, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump's Twitter page with his tweets about not recording his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey is photographed in Washington. Trump's Twitter account \u2014 from which he aggressively confronts those who displease him, suggests North Korea \"may not be around much longer!\" and promotes Trump Tower taco bowls \u2014 disappeared briefly Thursday night.  Some historic moments pass in one fell swoop.  President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s reading of the Gettysburg Address lasted only two or three minutes. Last year, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps smashed an ancient record when he swam the 200-meter individual medley in 1 minute and 54.66 seconds.  And then for a brief window on Thursday evening, 330 million Twitter users slid into a world without @realDonaldTrump.  President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account \u2014 from which he aggressively confronts those who displease him, suggests North Korea \u201cmay not be around much longer!\u201d and promotes Trump Tower taco bowls \u2014 disappeared.  Twitter initially posted a statement Thursday night saying Trump\u2019s \u201caccount was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.\u201d  Earlier today @realdonaldtrump\u2019s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again. \u2014 Twitter Government (@TwitterGov) November 3, 2017  For those few minutes, visitors to Trump\u2019s account were simply met with the message, \u201cSorry, that page doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d  \u201cThe account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.\u201d  But then two hours later, Twitter updated its statement saying that an investigation showed the deactivation \u201cwas done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee\u2019s last day.\u201d Twitter said it would be conducting a full internal review.  The company\u2019s tweet: Earlier today @realdonaldtrump\u2019s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.  Trump has used the account since March 2009. He has tweeted more than 36,000 times and has 41.7 million followers.  Trump has spoken publicly about his reliance on Twitter before. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network last month, Trump credited his use of social media as among the reasons he was elected.  \u201cYou have to keep people interested also,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, you have to keep people interested.\u201d  Twitter also serves as among Trump\u2019s main tools for deflecting criticisms and attacks. In the same interview, Trump said that \u201cWhen somebody says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it.\u201d  Trump conceded that those close to him try to steer him away from social media. But he insists on tweeting \u2014 spelling errors included \u2014 as a weapon against \u201cfake news.\u201d  Trump\u2019s account may have been \u201cinadvertently\u201d deactivated Thursday, but Twitter has also had to defend its decision not to take down particular presidential tweets.  In a six-tweet thread in September, Trump issues what some took as a threat directed at North Korea.  \u201cJust heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won\u2019t be around much longer!\u201d Trump wrote.  As The Post has reported, Twitter prohibits tweets that include violent threats, which some argued was Trump\u2019s intention.  Twitter responded saying a number of factors go into account when evaluating controversial content, including its \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d and whether it has \u201cpublic interest.\u201d  Those tweets confronting North Korea followed other instances where critics called for Trump\u2019s account to be more closely controlled, such as when he tweeted an edited video of himself beating somebody up, the victim\u2019s face replaced by a CNN logo.  And then there are the accounts that Twitter has chosen to suspend. Last month, the actress Rose McGowan took to Twitter to challenge Ben Affleck on his claim that he knew nothing of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s decades-long history of sexual assault and violence towards women.  \u201cYou lie,\u201d McGowan wrote in one tweet.  But another tweet led to the temporarily suspension of her account. Despite initially declining to comment on the content of that specific tweet, Twitter later explained that McGowan\u2019s \u201caccount was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service.\u201d  On Thursday alone, Trump used his account to congratulate the Houston Astros for winning the World Series, call on Congress to \u201cTERMINATE\u201d the diversity visa lottery and announce the nomination of Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve.  Trump was back tweeting at 8:05 p.m., praising the day\u2019s \u201cGreat Tax Cut rollout.\u201d  \u201cThe lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!\u201d  It was as if he never left.

From filmmaker Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream), Mother! stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in this riveting psychological thriller about love, devotion and sacrifice. (2017)  OSCAR-WINNING actress Jennifer Lawrence has suggested the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida were signs of \u201cMother Nature\u2019s rage and wrath\u201d at America for electing Donald Trump and not believing in man-made climate change.  Lawrence, who is promoting her new drama Mother!, appeared on British network Channel 4, where she discussed topics ranging from the movie to the gender pay gap and Mr Trump.  \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d the actress responded to the interviewer\u2019s assertion that there was \u201can end-of-days feeling\u201d across the world and especially in the US.  \u201cYou know, it\u2019s this new language that\u2019s forming. I don\u2019t even recognise it. It\u2019s also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.\u201d  \u201cAnd you have voted very recently, as a country\u201d the reporter noted \u2013 to which Lawrence replied that \u201cit was really startling\u201d Mr Trump was elected.  She then suggested the recent hurricanes devastating Texas and nearing Florida may have been prompted by Mr Trump winning the presidency.  \u201cYou know, you\u2019re watching these hurricanes now, and it\u2019s really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature\u2019s rage and wrath,\u201d Lawrence said.  Lawrence later said the conversation topics of Mr Trump and US politics were \u201creally polarising and upsetting.\u201d  \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it\u2019s just really confusing,\u201d she said.

I think I know exactly what he is.\u201d  Lawrence has never been shy about sharing her opinions on the President.  In 2015, when Trump had just launched his presidential campaign, she said a victory by him would \u201cbe the end of the world,\u201d during an Entertainment Weekly interview.

That\u2019s when artist Alex Gardega installed a pug statue called \u201cSketchy Dog,\u201d which appeared to be urinating on the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue\u2019s leg.  \"Most people were amused or perplexed by it,\" Gardega told NBC News. \"Kids petted it, people were taking pictures with it. A few were upset and kicked it.\"  Gardega said he created his clay and faux bronze \u201cSketchy Dog\u201d as an act of solidarity with guerilla artist Arturo Di Modica, who created Wall Street\u2019s iconic \u201cCharging Bull\u201d statue.  \u201cI have a lot of empathy for the creator of the bull, Arturo. He is very upset,\u201d Gardega said.  Artist Alex Gardega placed his \"sketchy dog\" statue next to \"Fearless Girl.\" Alex Gardega  Di Modica finished \u201cCharging Bull\u201d after the 1987 stock market collapse, and placed it in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a symbol of American resilience. The city initially removed it, but later re-installed it in its current location near Wall Street in the Financial District.  Conversely, the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue, was commissioned by one of the world\u2019s largest banks \u2014 State Street Global Advisors \u2014 as a way to call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, according to the company.  State Street is also the creator of the Gender Diversity Index SHE, which tracks gender diversity in companies. An inscription at the feet of \u201cFearless Girl\u201d reads, \u201cKnow the Power of Leadership, SHE makes a difference.\"  \u201cThat piece, [\u2018Fearless Girl\u2019] was not made by some individual artist making a statement,\u201d Gardega said. \u201cIt was made by a billion dollar financial firm trying to promote an index fund. It is advertising/promotion in the guise of art. That was my only point.\u201d  But Gardega said there is some value in the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d sculpture. He said it\u2019s clear that it makes children happy, and \u201cart is supposed to make kids happy.\u201d  After approximately three hours, Gardega took his \u201cSketchy Dog\u201d down.  \"I didn't want to leave it to be taken and certainly had no rights [sic] to bolt it to the ground,\" he said.  In response to the \"Sketchy Dog\" statue, State Street Global Advisors said it was proud of what \"Fearless Girl\" represented.  \"We continue to be grateful to the countless people around the world who continue to responded so enthusiastically to what the Fearless Girl represents \u2014 the power and potential of having more women in leadership,\" a State Street spokeswoman wrote in an email to NBC News. \"Fearless Girl was created to stand as a reminder that having more women in leadership positions positively contributes to overall performance and strengthens our economy.\"  Gardega said that there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d and he created \u201cSketchy Dog\u201d with a sense of humor, but he said neither piece should interfere with Di Modica\u2019s work.  \u201cI'm a pretty happy person, not seething or angry and certainly not anti-feminist. My piece is not without a sense of humor but I do feel for Arturo and the integrity of his art,\u201d Gardega said. \u201cThere is plenty of room for \u2018Fearless Girl.\u2019 It just interferes with another artist's work/vision.\u201d",

The Secrets of My Life author later released a full statement on her website. \u201cI believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country\u2019s uniform,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFurthermore, this half-baked idea puts all of our service members in harm\u2019s way. Does President Trump intend to just pull 15,000 people out of every critical position to which they are currently assigned? That would disrupt core military missions around the world and needlessly endanger our troops.\u201d  Jenner concluded her blog post: \u201cAmerica\u2019s 15,000 trans service members and 134,000 veterans are much braver than you, Mr. Trump; my allegiance is with them and our country, not you.\u201d  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.",

        "generated_text": "It seems that the National Enquirer, along with some of Trump's friends, have once again been criticized for spreading unverified and unsupported information. This time, the focus is on Chelsea Clinton, who has been the target of rumors and false stories in the Enquirer. The Enquirer has been known to push out false narratives, such as the idea that Elvis Presley was still alive and that Ted Cruz's father helped kill JFK. The Enquirer is not taken seriously by many, while the New York Times, Washington Post, and other reputable news outlets are. Trump's friends at the Enquirer have been accused of \"carrying water\" for him, while Chelsea Clinton has been trying to bond with Megyn Kelly over their shared dislike of the Enquirer. However, some of Kelly's supporters have been critical of her, pointing out that she voted for Trump and has been involved in unsupported rumors about her. Despite this, some of Kelly's supporters have been very vocal about their admiration for her and her willingness to speak out against the Enquirer and other tabloids. Overall, it appears that the Enquirer's reputation for spreading false information has once again come under scrutiny, while Kelly and Clinton have been attempting to bond over their shared dislike of the Enquirer.",

Trump, 35, and her husband, Jared Kushner, 36, have three children: Arabella, 6, Joseph, 3, and Theodore, 1.  \u201cWith each of my three children, I had some level of postpartum depression,\u201d Trump said. Symptoms of the condition, which affects some women after giving birth, can include extreme sadness and anxiety.  \u201cIt was a very challenging emotional time for me because I felt like I was not living up to my potential as a parent or as an entrepreneur and executive,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI had had such easy pregnancies that in some way, the juxtaposition hit me even harder.\u201d  When host Dr. Mehmet Oz asked, why talk about postpartum depression? Trump laughed and said that she hadn\u2019t planned to discuss the topic until he asked.  \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, I consider myself a very hard-charging person. I am ambitious. I\u2019m passionate. I\u2019m driven, but this is something that affects parents all over the country.\u201d  Research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that about one in nine women experiences postpartum depression. With the reveal, Trump joins actress Lena Headey, model Chrissy Teigen and singer Adele, who all went public with their postpartum struggles.  Mothers who have a personal or family history of depression and those who abuse alcohol are more likely than others to experience postpartum symptoms. Other factors \u2013 including stress, low social support, and pregnancy or birth complications \u2013 also place women at higher risk of postpartum depression.  The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends cognitive behavioral therapy or counseling for women with the condition.  Trump told Oz that her decisions \u201cweigh much heavier\u201d now that they are \u201cimpacting people\u2019s lives.\u201d  \u201cOne thing that I continue to do is meditate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been enormously helpful to me.\u201d  She added that it is difficult to find the time since her children wake early but that an investment of 15 or 20 minutes every morning \u201crecharges\u201d her and is \u201calmost the equivalent\u201d of hours of sleep.  \u2018I don\u2019t view it as my obligation to moderate\u2019  In January, Ivanka Trump\u2019s family relocated to Washington from New York City so that both Trump and Kushner could accept positions as senior advisers in her father\u2019s administration. Though at first her position was voluntary, as of March 30, she has served as an unpaid employee in the White House, as has Kushner.  Trump has voiced support for women\u2019s rights and a paid family leave program, yet some critics say she has not exerted enough of a positive influence on her father\u2019s agenda, particularly his health care policy.  When Oz asked for her response to the expectation that she be a \u201cvoice of moderation\u201d in the White House, Trump said, \u201cwhere I disagree with the agenda, I\u2019ll share it with him quietly, but I don\u2019t view it as my obligation to moderate.\u201d  One of Trump\u2019s causes: fighting human trafficking.

Moments after the interview ended, a skeptical Robin Roberts said on-air: \u201cShe said she has a story to tell, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be selling that story. Yeah, she will.\u201d And then, referencing an oft-quoted barb from Ice Cube\u2019s Friday movie:  \u201cBye, Felicia.\u201d",

After Donald Trump, anything seems possible (or a massive upgrade, TBH.) The politically-minded George, 57, and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, 40, were definitely looking like the First Couple of Hollywood during the AFI Life Achievement Gala. Some would love to see these two move into 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue, as a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that \u201cHollywood friends the likes of Julia Roberts and many more were not only interested in honoring their friend [at the AFI event] but they also wanted to grab his ear to try to convince him to run for President.\u201d  \u201cThey think he would be amazing\u201d as president, the source tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cWith Amal, as the first lady, by his side and whomever he would choose as a Vice President, it would be one of the most amazing things they could see him do.\u201d The source says that if there were any possibility to convince George to run, it would have been at the AFI event, as it was \u201cthe night where everyone who respects him was honoring him for his work in the entertainment world.\u201d The insider added that Candidate Clooney would have been \u201ca very big topic of conversation all night that George would not be able to get away from.\u201d  Did someone get in George\u2019s ear during the gala and convince him to throw his hat in the ring when the 2020 election rolls around? Only time will tell. Granted, Amal \u2013 who Tina Fey famously described at the 2015 Golden Globes as \u201ca human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case; was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria; and was selected for a three-person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip\u201d \u2013 would be more qualified for the role of President of the United States of America. However, she was born in Lebanon, and is not eligible to run for the role. So, if people want Amal in the White House, they\u2019d better hope George announces his candidacy sometime between now and November 3, 2020.  George and Amal already won the election to be president \u2013 of our hearts! Before George accepted the 46th AFI Lifetime Achievement Award, Amal addressed the love of her life. \u201cI met George when I was 35 and starting to become quite resigned to the idea that I was going to be a spinster. Then we met and started hiding out in my London flat and very soon it felt like, no matter what happened, I would never want to be with anyone else,\u201d she said. Oh, just a FYI \u2013 during the AFI event, former president Barack Obama, 55, sent in a pre-taped statement.

Yet it wasn't until more than three decades afterwards that a United States president would declare June as a month of pride and commemoration for LGBTQ people in the country. And before we move forward with our celebration, it's important to understand how we got here.  While the Stonewall Riots are mostly considered the pivotal moment in creating LGBTQ pride, major actions for visibility and equal rights were taking place beforehand in the 1950s and 1960s. Early demonstrations were done by the Mattachine Society, which focused on civil and political rights of gay men, and the Daughters of Bilitis, a lesbian rights group, with both carrying out Philadelphia's \"Annual Reminders\" which saw picketers reminding Americans that LGBTQ people did not receive basic civil rights. In response to the police raid at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn, now known as the Stonewall Riots, the queer community and its supporters decided they would meet in June in New York City to march and remember the incident. Originally called Christopher Street Liberation Day, the demonstration took place on June 28, 1970, with similar demonstrations spreading annually around the country and world. In 2000, President Bill Clinton declared June as \"Gay & Lesbian Pride Month\" and the month has gone unrecognized except for President Barack Obama later declaring the month as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month every year of his presidency.  While the history is certainly a part of the celebration, here at Fuse we're using the next 30 days to look forward. We're celebrating Future LGBTQ History. Each day during the month of June, we'll spotlight the future of LGBTQ history by showcasing the world's most talented, creative and influential people on the rise. Some are young and at the start of their takeover; others are already commanding the world's attention. What brings these people together is the promise of inspiring change for years to come.",

The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.  Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.  I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won\u2019t be available by the end of the month, we won\u2019t have reliable answers to any of those questions.  I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill\u2019s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.

Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was also a participant on the W20 Summit panel, which Ivanka Trump attended at Merkel\u2019s invitation.  \u201cCertainly not the latter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m rather unfamiliar with this role as well. ... It has been a little under 100 days, and it has just been a remarkable and incredible journey.\u201d  She did not define what her new role as a senior White House official entailed but said she cares \u201cvery much about empowering women in the workplace\u201d and defined her goal as enacting \u201cincremental positive change. That is my goal. This is very early for me; I\u2019m listening, learning.\u201d  The questions asked of Trump seemed more direct than those about women in the workforce posed to other panelists. But there was a deep curiosity in Europe, ahead of her visit here, about the first daughter\u2019s new role in her father\u2019s administration.  Ivanka Trump, who was deeply involved with her father\u2019s campaign and has been instrumental in his administration in the first three months in office, positioned herself as someone who is still in humbling listening-tour mode. \u201cI\u2019m striving to think about how best to empower women in the economy,\u201d she said, at one point calling herself a feminist. \u201cI have no doubt that coming out of this trip I\u2019ll be more informed.\u201d  But she was booed and hissed at by the majority-women audience at the conference when she lauded her father for supporting paid-leave policies. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my father\u2019s advocacy,\u201d she said, calling him \u201ca tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive.\u201d  Meckel, the moderator, pushed her to address the vocal disapproval from the audience.  \u201cYou hear the reaction from the audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to address one more point \u2014 some attitudes toward women your father has displayed might leave one questioning whether he\u2019s such an empowerer for women.\u201d  During the campaign, more than a dozen women went public to accuse Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, unwanted advances and assault. Ivanka Trump did not comment on those accusations during the campaign, and on Tuesday she dismissed the criticism via her father\u2019s favorite enemy \u2014 the press.  \u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard the criticism from the media, that\u2019s been perpetuated,\u201d she said, drawing laughs from the audience.  And despite being invited to attend the panel by Merkel in her role as a senior White House official, she defended her father from her vantage point of loyal daughter \u2014 in what appeared to be muscle memory from when she was confronted by uncomfortable questions about her father on the campaign.  \u201cAs a daughter, I can speak on a very personal level,\u201d Ivanka Trump said. \u201cI grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do; he provided that for us.\u201d She said that her father treated her exactly the same way he treated her two brothers, who now run the family business. \u201cThere was no difference,\u201d she said.  Trump also credited her father\u2019s administration for hiring women in important roles.  \u201cThe team basically going through the vetting and hiring process \u2014 six out of eight of those people are women,\u201d she said.  Ivanka Trump and her team touted the summit as a political win, in a question-and-answer session with reporters following the panel, noting that Merkel had announced from the stage her support to work together on a fund to support women entrepreneurs.  \u201cPolitics is politics, as I\u2019m learning,\u201d Ivanka Trump said, shrugging off the reaction to her comments at the panel. \u201cMy father is a champion for all Americans \u2014 women, of course.... I think the fact that he\u2019s embraced my interest in taking on this role shows that he aligns with the interests I most deeply care about and advocate for. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t make for a very good family dynamic.\u201d  She insisted that the president has been a \u201cchampion of women\u201d throughout his career.  As for the pointed questions from the moderator, she shrugged: \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d",

In Sunday\u2019s episode, during an interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, Baron Cohen in character as Dr. Ruddick was asked by the Senator if he is disabled, and he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy.\u201d  It\u2019s true \u2014 Sanders blatantly asked Cohen, who was in disguise, if he has \u201ca disability.\u201d Cohen replied, \u201cNo I don\u2019t. This here scooter is to conserve my body\u2019s finite energy.\u201d  Showtime\u2019s statement continues, \u201cIn addition, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the U.S. military to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview, and contrary to her claims he did not appear in a wheelchair. In both the interview with Governor Palin and the interview with Senator Sanders, he did not wear military apparel of any kind.\u201d  Sacha Baron Cohen interviews Bernie Sanders in character as Dr. Ruddick. (Photo: Organized Speech via YouTube)  Palin was so heated over her exchange with Cohen that she went on Good Morning America to bash the actor\u2019s ruse.  \u201cIt was proposed to me as a legitimate interview to speak about veterans issues and our military and current events to a new audience. It was supposed to be this big-time Showtime documentary, and it was passed on to me by a speakers\u2019 bureau, which, you know, I would assume had done some vetting,\u201d she told Robin Roberts. \u201cThis \u2018comedian\u2019 is obviously very good at lying, at duping people.\u201d  The former Alaska governor said she knew something wasn\u2019t right when Cohen, posed as Dr. Ruddick, claimed Chelsea Clinton was the recipient of a government-funded sex change.  \u201cIt just got worse and worse and worse as the minutes went on in this bizarre, um, really embarrassing, humiliating interview that mocked middle-class Americans. It mocked our values. It mocked the disabled. It just got worse and worse,\u201d she said.  When informed that Cohen denied posing as a war vet, she called him a \u201cproven liar,\u201d adding, \u201cnobody can believe a word he\u2019s saying now as to his rebuttal.\u201d  Palin wasn\u2019t the only political figure peeved about the whole thing.

In the show's premiere episode, Cohen posed as Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., PhD, a disabled war veteran, and interviewed Bernie Sanders and Sarah Palin. However, Cohen denied saying he was a \"war vet\" to gain access to Palin, and Showtime has backed Cohen up, pointing to the episode as proof that he did not present himself as a disabled veteran. Showtime also denied that Cohen presented himself as a disabled veteran to Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview. Despite Palin's allegations that Cohen was lying, Showtime remains firmly behind Cohen and is confident that the show will be a ratings hit.",

Like, why did he wear spandex for an Apple commercial that aired exclusively in Europe? It was funny. That's a good enough reason. Also, ever since his grave misfortune at the hands of Bernie Madoff, Bacon has been vocal about the need for creatives to take a more structured approach to managing their finances. Perhaps the money was worth the spandex.  The latest Bacon question: Is he really singing the praises of President Donald Trump?  In the depressing age of fake news, there is a dual responsibility to identify the difference between news that is actually false or fabricated and news that simply rubs us the wrong way, generally because it comes with a slant or there are omissions that would otherwise provide a more comprehensive picture.  We can decidedly say that a recent story claiming Kevin Bacon believes we are all \"blessed\" to have Donald Trump as our president is utterly untrue.  The dubious news blog Worldwide Politics published a story on Sunday recapping a supposed interview Kevin Bacon had on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos.\" During this interview, the actor reportedly gushed over President Trump.  \u201cI honestly think that we are blessed to have him as President \u2013 he is the only one who can take care of all this mess,\" Bacon supposedly said. \u201cHe should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.\u201d  Bacon, of course, campaigned for John Edwards in 2007 and later donated to Barack Obama in 2008, officially endorsing the former president during his successful re-election bid in 2012. That's not to say some Obama voters didn't shift their support to Trump in 2016, but little about Bacon's political past suggests he would have done so himself.  Here's the kicker: Kevin Bacon last appeared on \"This Week\" in 2007 and never spoke a word about Donald Trump.  Worldwide Politics is the epitome of a fake news website. It's also not the only one that traffics in falsified celebrity news. Late last month, the Daily News for Americans ran a made-up story claiming actress Julia Roberts \u2014 an attendee of the Women's March in Washington, D.C. \u2014 called Trump \"the best president in US history.\"  The only place this Kevin Bacon story may have legs, in other words, is in a game of \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\"",

Share this article Share  This is hardly the first time we've seen Trump wrapped up in a dispute involving a Gold Star family. In fact, it's the second day in a row in which Trump's comments about the relatives of dead service members have been at issue. On Monday, he suggested that his chief of staff, retired Marine general John Kelly, had not received a phone call from President Barack Obama after his son's death. White House officials have only elaborated on the matter anonymously.  The body of Sgt. La David Johnson arrived in Miami on Oct. 17. President Trump called the soldier's family that same day to give his condolences. According to a Florida congresswoman, Trump told Johnson's grieving widow, \"He knew what he signed up for.\" (Video: Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)  Going back to the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump showed very little compunction about attacking the Khans, a Gold Star family that criticized him, and publicly questioned the war hero status of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war for seven years in Vietnam. While most politicians treat these matters very, very delicately \u2014 or steer clear of them altogether \u2014 Trump has repeatedly declined to do so. He has often proactively politicized them.  Advertisement  There is a tendency to think that some of this is just Trump being provocative and trying to rile up the media by pushing the boundaries of acceptable and presidential behavior. The simpler \u2014 and not mutually exclusive \u2014 alternative is that he just doesn't know how a president should act in these instances.  In this case, we have alleged Trump comments that were never meant for public consumption. If accurately relayed, they were just Trump being careless, not provocative. But they completely track with everything he has done and said publicly about tragedy before. It's not even difficult to imagine Trump saying these things at a lectern in the Rose Garden.  So again, it's worth waiting to see what \u201cproof\u201d Trump produces. But the benefit of the doubt went out the window a long time ago, and Trump has himself to blame.",

        "generated_text": "President Donald Trump sparked controversy yet again on Sunday when he shared a Twitter video of himself physically attacking a man with the CNN logo superimposed over his face. The video, accompanied by the caption \"#FraudNewsNetwork\" and \"#FNN,\" was part of the president's ongoing feud with CNN and other media outlets. This is not the first time Trump has targeted CNN; he has been feuding with \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all week, referring to them as \"low I.Q. crazy,\" \"dumb as a rock,\" and \"psycho.\"\n\nWhile Trump has defended his social media etiquette, many celebrities and prominent figures have spoken out against his latest tweet. J.K. Rowling referenced George Washington's advice to \"persevere in one's duty, and be silent, is the best answer to calumny\" in her critique of the controversial clip. Ava DuVernay highlighted what she perceives as hypocrisy between how Trump and former President Barack Obama are treated, pointing out that white supremacy allows a clearly diminished man to post such a tweet without consequence, but blocked the dignity of Obama at every turn.\n\nOther Twitter users, such as Andy Cohen, Mia Farrow, and Kal Penn, were shocked by the president's tweet. Zendaya and Lauren Jauregui from Fifth Harmony were among those who didn't try to hide their disdain for the president. CNN responded to Trump's tweet with a statement, criticizing the president for encouraging violence against reporters and calling on him to focus on more important matters.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump has announced that she will be closing her namesake fashion brand, more than a year after she separated herself from the company and entered the White House as a senior adviser. The brand became a lightning rod for critics of her father's policies, with one anti-Trump group urging shoppers to boycott stores selling Trump-branded goods. Retailers have also faced criticism for carrying the brand.",

She was speaking with Victoria Derbyshire of BBC Two, promoting the based-on-a-true-story film \u201cLion,\u201d which she described as a \u201clove letter \u2026 to mothers and children.\u201d In it, she portrays an Australian woman who, with her husband, adopts a lost Indian boy named Saroo.  During the interview, Derbyshire brought up Kidman\u2019s dual Australian and American citizenship and noted the actress voted in the U.S. election.  \u201cI\u2019m always reticent to start sort of commenting politically,\u201d Kidman began. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it in terms of America, or Australia. I\u2019m issue-based.\u201d  Then she continued, \u201cI just say he\u2019s now elected and we as a country need to support whoever\u2019s the president because that\u2019s what the country\u2019s based on. However that happened, he\u2019s there, and let\u2019s go. \u201d  Advertisement  After these remarks, she quickly discussed two topics \u2014 same-sex marriage and women\u2019s health care and equality.  She said the former should be legal in Australia. On the latter, she said, \u201cI\u2019m very, very committed to women\u2019s issues in terms of I do a lot of fundraising for U.N. Women and I do a lot of traveling for them. I also do an enormous amount of fundraising for breast and ovarian cancer, because that\u2019s something that\u2019s affected my family deeply. So they\u2019re my issues that I\u2019m very attached to.\u201d  Kidman quickly came under fire on social media.  \u201cI think it\u2019s time for Nicole Kidman to move to Russia,\u201d tweeted one user. \u201cNicole Kidman married Tom Cruise who is a Scientologist. Her advice is the last thing America needs!\u201d tweeted another. \u201cWould you follow Hitler, just because he has a title?\u201d asked one user.  Advertisement  https://twitter.com/BumbleBUnicorn/status/819820861913964544  Her comments are a sharp departure from the rhetoric most celebrities have used since Trump\u2019s surprise victory over Hillary Clinton.  Most recently, Meryl Streep used her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes as a semi-political vehicle, espousing the virtues of a \u201cprincipled press\u201d and condemning the powerful who use bullying as a means of control. She never once mentioned Trump\u2019s name while clearly speaking about him, bringing up \u201cthe person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitat[ing] a disabled reporter.\u201d  \u201cAnd this instinct to humiliate, when it\u2019s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody\u2019s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,\u201d Streep said.

Whether it\u2019s a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That\u2019s what he\u2019s appealing to.

In it, he called Trump \u201can incompetent pig with dangerous ideas, a serious psychiatric disorder, no knowledge of the world and no curiosity to learn,\u201d then wrote simply, \u201cThis is truly horrible.\u201d  Share this article Share  As The Washington Post reported:  It was full of sharp language and vitriol (at one point, he called the president-elect a certain type of \u201cnozzle\u201d that can\u2019t be printed here; at another, he stated Trump will be impeached within the year), despite the magazine labeling it as \u201cmoving.\u201d  That said, there have been a few celebrities who have urged Americans to give Trump a chance, even if he wasn\u2019t their first pick for the presidency.  We all need to give President-Elect Trump a chance. Support the good. Lobby against what we disagree on. No one is bigger than us all \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) November 9, 2016  While accepting the Trevor Hero Honoree Award at the annual fundraiser for the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth, Kelly Osbourne said to the audience, \u201cWe have to give him a chance.

Let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt and see if we can find common ground. That is what\u2019s best for African Americans.\u201d  Finally, some have outright supported Trump, such as former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who told Black Press USA, \u201cWe don\u2019t need another politician, we need a businessman like Trump.\u201d  More from Morning Mix:",

        "doc_2_text": "This meme \u2014 the notion that in 2016 actor Denzel Washington publicly supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2014 is an example of a false claim that has evolved over time as it has spread across social media and on a variety of unreliable websites. Other iterations of this rumor falsely quoted Washington as saying that when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, \u201cwe avoided a war with Russia, and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state.\u201d  This rumor first went viral in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. It resurfaced in February 2018 when Washington was nominated for an Oscar \u2014 and appeared yet again in April 2018, after musician Kanye West tweeted a statement of support for Trump, reigniting longstanding discussions about the political loyalties of black American voters.  Insight: Viral rumors often recirculate when new contexts for them emerge.  What can we learn?  Let\u2019s start with an instance of this viral meme that was included in a post on a highly suspect website \u2014 USALibertyPress.com \u2014 in February 2018:  Note: The link in the previous paragraph is to an archive of the \u201cfake news\u201d website. That avoids linking to the site itself and giving it additional web traffic and ad revenue.  The first step we should take is to do a little lateral reading* on the claim itself. So let\u2019s do a quick search:  All the top results for this search are from fact-checking organizations, so we can safely assume that this is a questionable claim. A quick read of the fact checks confirms that the claims in both the headline and the meme on the Liberty Press website are false. PolitiFact traced the headline claim to a well-known \u201cfake news\u201d website, YourNewsWire.com, and Snopes shows that the quote attributed to Washington was actually said by Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, in an interview with the New York Post.  Note: Like pieces of quality journalism, good fact checks and debunking articles are transparent. They don\u2019t ask you to trust them; they show you why you should trust them.  But this still leaves us with questions about the source of the information. The source we started with is USALibertyPress.com, so let\u2019s begin there.  Since the site does not have an \u201cAbout\u201d section \u2014 a red flag in itself \u2014 we can try to see who might have established it by searching the WHOIS registry, a database of website registration information.  Tool: WHOIS is a database of website domain registration information that you can search using any number of free portals, such as whois.net and GoDaddy\u2019s WHOIS search portal.  A quick search for \u201cUSALibertyPress.com\u201d on GoDaddy\u2019s WHOIS search portal gave us this**:  As the highlighted areas show, this site was registered by someone at an address in Veles, Macedonia \u2014 a hub for \u201cfake news\u201d purveyors. A quick search for Veles confirms its infamy:  We now have all we need to confirm that not only is this a false claim, but at least one website pushing it is part of a network of \u201cfake news\u201d sites based in Macedonia.  Finally, you could use Google Street View to see the physical address in Veles that was used to register this site:  There is quite a bit more you could do with this example \u2014 see this tweet thread for more ideas \u2014 but these three steps (reading laterally for additional information, searching the WHOIS registry for a website\u2019s origin and using Google Street View to check out the location) are important skills that will help you sort fact from fiction in the future.  *The lateral reading concept and the term itself developed from research conducted by the Stanford History Education Group (SHEG), led by Sam Wineburg, founder and executive director of SHEG.  **UPDATE (Aug. 28, 2018): The domain registration for www.usalibertypress.com was updated on July 28, 2018, and no longer includes information about the registrant in Macedonia. The site itself is now offline.",

Kensington Palace said the baby, the couple's second son, will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.  Prince Louis, born at St. Mary's Hospital in London at one minute after 11 a.m. local time on Monday, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces at birth.  Louis (pronounced \"Louie\") is one of Prince William's several middle names and was also given to his other son, Prince George, as a middle name.  Arthur, which had been the favorite name among British bettors, was the middle name of great-granny Queen Elizabeth II's father, King George VI, as well as that carried by King Arthur of Britain's mythic past.  The name Louis is more closely associated with French monarchs, such as Louis XIV, the Sun King. In British royal terms, the name can be seen as a touching honor to the baby's great-grandfather, Prince Philip, 96, and a posthumous honor to Lord Louis \"Uncle Dickie\" Mountbatten, a royal relation (like them, descended from Queen Victoria) and Philip's uncle.  As a young orphaned Greek royal exile, Philip was raised by Mountbatten and was introduced to the then-Princess Elizabeth as a teen through the ambitious matchmaking of Uncle Dickie.  Mountbatten was especially close to the baby's grandfather, Prince Charles, who viewed him as a mentor and father figure. A former British Navy leader and the last British viceroy of India, Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb at age 79 (along with some of his family) while fishing off his Irish estate in 1979, a shocking tragedy that devastated the royal family.  The baby is the couple's third child and is the first little prince to be affected by a 2013 change in British laws that made birth order more important than gender in determining the line of succession to the throne.  Thus, this baby is fifth in line, behind his older sister instead of displacing her.  Uncle Prince Harry, 33, moved down to sixth in line, and any children he has with his American fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle, 36, will follow him in the succession.  Will and Kate's other recent name choices \u2014 Prince George Alexander Louis, 4, and Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, 2 \u2014 come from the 18th and 19th centuries, balancing tradition, family obligations and personal taste.  More:Duchess Kate and Prince William leave hospital with new baby prince  More:How does Duchess Kate do it?

Kate was wearing a Jenny Packham knee-length red dress with a white Peter Pan collar, and showed only a slight remaining baby bump. Later, they went back inside briefly, then reemerged holding hands, with Will carrying the baby in a baby car seat. Then they returned to their Kensington Palace apartment as news helicopters followed them from above.  Prince William was there for the birth, as he was for their previous two children.

Kate was wearing a Jenny Packham knee-length red dress with a white Peter Pan collar, and showed only a slight remaining baby bump. Later, they went back inside briefly, then reemerged holding hands, with Will carrying the baby in a baby car seat. Then they returned to their Kensington Palace apartment as news helicopters followed them from above.  Prince William was there for the birth, as he was for their previous two children. The baby was born on St. George's Day, marking the national day for England's patron saint.  More:Royal baby: Where does the new prince fit in the line for the throne?",

The source revealed that Kate has been showing the sonogram to her closest friends and is thrilled to be pregnant with two little princesses. Life & Style claims that William and Kate want the twins to be seen as individuals and will not coordinate their names to rhyme or start with the same letter.\n\nThe US report also reveals that Kate is desperate to name one of the twins Diana, which William is reportedly \"thrilled\" about. The palace is reportedly gearing up for the arrival of two new royal bubs, with the duchess planning to give birth at Kensington Palace in just under two months. A palace insider told Life & Style that Kate has been advised to go on bed rest now that she's around the seven-month mark.\n\nFour days after the birth of their new royal baby, Kensington Palace announced that the baby, their second son, would be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge. The baby, born at St. Mary's Hospital in London at one minute after 11 a.m. local time on Monday, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces at birth. Louis is one of Prince William's several middle names and was also given to his other son, Prince George. Arthur, which had been the favorite name among British bettors, was the middle name of great-granny Queen Elizabeth II's father, King George VI, as well as that carried by King Arthur of Britain's mythic past.\n\nThe baby is the couple's third child and is the first little prince to be affected by a 2013 change in British laws that made birth order more important than gender in determining the line of succession to the throne. Thus, this baby is fifth in line, behind his older sister instead of displacing her. Uncle Prince Harry, 33, moved down to sixth in line, and any children he has with his American fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle, 36, will follow him in the succession.\n\nIn naming their children, Will and Kate have skillfully navigated the tricky shoals of meeting history's expectations while sending branding signals to the public that \"we're like you, we're a family.\" Christian Turner, global director of naming at the brand-strategy firm Siegel+Gale, says that George and Charlotte are examples of historical names that also have become popular in recent decades with everyone else. \"The royals are trying to connect with the people; they're putting in the hours trying to make sure they're royal in bearing and stature but also familiar and accessible to everyone,\" Turner says.\n\nThe young royal family emerged from the hospital six hours after the delivery Monday, baby in Kate's arms, as cheers from a small crowd of onlookers erupted and the cameras of the usual huge media mob whirred and clicked.

Some reports suggest that Prince George is driven to his school, Thomas\u2019s of Battersea in London, by either his mother or his father.

Meanwhile, Princess Charlotte, whose nursery is within walking distance of the family home, is walked there by one of her parents too.  Instead of enlisting a member of staff with these duties, the royal couple, William and Kate endeavour to put their children first.          Same kind of normality is there at their home too.  When it comes to their home in Kensington Palace\u2019s Apartments, Charlotte is apparently a great hostess. As per our royal source: \u201cShe\u2019ll come up to guests and ask them if they want tea or coffee or offer them sweets\u201d.  This isn\u2019t the first time that Kate and William have seen trying to keep their children\u2019s lives normal. Earlier this month, Kate was spotted doing some back-to-school shopping with the kids, as they looked for new school shoes.

        "doc_2_text": "Kate Middleton is calling off her third pregnancy plans, mostly because Prince William has apparently been an absentee father. The Duchess of Cambridge has made it no secret that she\u2019s unhappy with her current situation at home.  In a new Heads Together clip with Prince William and Prince Harry, Kate Middleton hints that she\u2019s done having children. She struggled so much after the birth of her first child, Prince George. Kate recalled how she wasn\u2019t prepared for all the life changes that come after having your first child. During Kate\u2019s heartfelt confession, William sat next to her in silence.  \u201cHaving a child, particularly your first child, is such a life-changing moment,\u201d Kate said in the clip. \u201cNothing can really prepare you for that. Remember the first few days with little George, you have no idea what really you are doing, no matter how many books you read, nothing can prepare you for it.\u201d  Kate Middleton has made it no secret that she often feels lonely and isolated at home. Clearly, she doesn\u2019t have many close friends to turn to. And, it doesn\u2019t look like Prince William is helping their situation, either. Kate\u2019s supposedly been using a secret account on the popular mom forum Mumset for advice on how to parent her two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at home.  Often times she finds herself butting heads with her husband simply because of their different backgrounds and upbringings. Simply put, Kate Middleton doesn\u2019t want her children to have the same, stiff royal upbringing that Prince William experienced. She wants to be more hands-on with her children.  But if Kate can\u2019t handle raising two kids on her own, there\u2019s simply no way that she\u2019ll manage three small children under the age of 5. That might be the reason why she\u2019s saying no to a third pregnancy. She doesn\u2019t want to be left alone, angry and frustrated with the struggles of raising small children while her husband goes off on one of his ski trips with his pals.  Then again, the only two people who really know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors are of course the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge themselves. So far Buckingham Palace has not made any comments about Kate Middleton\u2019s future plans. Also, check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here.

A palace source reveals the 35-year-old doesn\u2019t want her offspring lumped together.  \u201c[She wants the twins to] be seen as individuals and allowed to develop their own personalities,\u201d the source shares. And, like she did with Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, Kate is keeping the gender(s) under wraps, but those closest to her say she\u2019s having identical girls.  Though fans have been on the lookout for clues based on the brunette beauty\u2019s wardrobe, she\u2019s been all over the map! In her first public appearance since the pregnancy announcement in September, Kate wore a blue Temperley long-sleeved dress, but followed that up a week later with a pale pink Orla Kiely frock.  Kate and husband Prince William are currently in the process of designing duel nurseries for their new additions, who are due in April. \u201cThe twins will sleep in separate bedrooms but will share a playroom with George and Charlotte,\u201d the palace source explains. \u201cKate feels that it\u2019s important for her eldest two to bond with the newborns. She\u2019s obviously worried that George and Charlotte will be jealous of the babies, especially Charlotte, who loves being the center of attention. But Kate knows that sibling rivalry is all part of the process of growing up.\u201d  She\u2019s still suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness, but recently gushed about William\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky.

Life & Style previously revealed that despite being fifth and sixth in line for the throne, the twins\u2019 births could affect the rules of succession. They were previously changed in March 2015 to ignore gender bias, so even if Kate does have one girl and one boy, whichever one is born first would be next in line behind Charlotte.",

Pippa is a marathoner and generally super active.  \"When I learned the happy news that I was pregnant, I realized I needed to adjust my normal 4-to-5-day-a-week routine and find a way of continuing my exercise safely throughout the three trimesters,\" she wrote in the column.  \"I\u2019m fanatical about sports and have looked at loads of books and websites on exercise during pregnancy but have been disappointed by the limited technical information on what you can and can\u2019t do. I found that particularly so during the riskier first trimester. And this being my first pregnancy, I had so many questions I felt were all unanswered.\"  Pippa wrote that she kept the news private when she first learned of her pregnancy and that unlike her sister Kate, she hasn't suffered from severe morning sickness. \"I was lucky to pass the 12-week [mark] without suffering from morning sickness,\" she wrote. \"That meant I was able to carry on as normal and continue most of my sports with better knowledge and, more importantly, professionals to learn from.\"  \"I\u2019ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it\u2019s being strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth, and recovery,\" she added.

The Duchess of Cambridge recently admitted that she often feels isolated as a young mother to her two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Yet royal observers can\u2019t help but wonder if Kate might be trying to relay a different kind of message with her heartfelt admission.  During a Team Heads Together event in London, Kate Middleton said motherhood has often made her feel lonely, too. She was chatting with the fellow mothers who have developed an app to help mothers find friends who are in a similar situation as they are.  According to the Independent, the Duchess reportedly told them, \u201cYes, it is lonely at times and you do feel quite isolated but actually so many other mothers are going through exactly what you are going through. It is being brave enough, like you obviously were, to reach out to those around you.\u201d  A lot of people can\u2019t help but wonder just how lonely Kate might be feeling behind closed doors at times. This isn\u2019t the first time that Kate Middleton has made headlines for her personal problems. Recent reports also indicated that Kate might be a secret user of the online chat forum, Mumsnet. A lot of fans believe that Kate is secretly struggling with parenthood and that\u2019s why she\u2019s been using the online parenting site for advice. That\u2019s mostly because she and Prince William have differing opinions when it comes to raising their children.  Kate doesn\u2019t want Prince George and Princess Charlotte to have the same stiff, royal upbringing that their father experienced. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been trying to be as hands-on as possible with them. But William doesn\u2019t see it this way. He just wants her to get on with things without worrying too much about every little problem that arises for them and their kids. And unfortunately, Kate doesn\u2019t have many people to turn to.  Of course, the only two people who really know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors as Prince William and Kate Middleton themselves. But knowing how lonely and isolated Princess Diana felt while she was still married to Prince Charles, there\u2019s a good chance that Kate might be feeling the same way. Plus, it doesn\u2019t help that she and Prince William don\u2019t often see eye-to-eye about their issues. Check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here!

However, she reassured the mothers that they are not alone in their struggles, and that it takes courage to reach out to others for support.\n\nWhile Kate Middleton and Prince William have differing opinions on the upbringing of their children, Kate has been more hands-on, while William is more laid back.

Some fans believe that Kate might be secretly using Mumsnet because she and William have differing opinions on raising their children.\n\nDespite the challenges they face as parents, Kate and William have been active in various charity initiatives, including the anti-bullying project that they visited at the BBC.

George wants to make sure the twins enter the world in the most royal manner possible.  According to entertainment portal Aceshowbiz.com, the Hollywood star has rented out the entire Kensington Wing at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which essentially comes down to $580,000 for a week's stay. Amal is also apparently flying in two 'birth companions' from Los Angeles for around $30,000. George also wants Amal to be completely relaxed during the birth, which is why he hired an Italian masseuse for the hotshot lawyer for $5,000.

Prince William and Kate Middleton have revealed the name they\u2019ve chosen for their baby boy.  \u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles,\u201d Kensington Palace said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.\u201d  Louis (pronounced \u201cLU-EE\u201d) means \u201crenowned warrior\u201d in French, and is likely a tribute to Prince Philip, whose grandfather was Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg. Louis is also part of Prince William\u2019s full name of William Arthur Philip Louis and Prince George\u2019s full name of George Alexander Louis. The name holds great meaning to William\u2019s own father, Prince Charles, whose beloved great-uncle and mentor, Earl Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the IRA in 1979.  The royal baby\u2019s middle names of Charles and Arthur also hold special meaning. Charles, of course, is in honor of the baby boy\u2019s grandfather, Prince Charles. And the name Arthur is a family tradition. Both dad William and grandfather Charles have it as a middle name. Arthur was also the name of Queen Victoria\u2019s third son (and seventh child) and was said to be her favorite child.  The name Arthur, which means \u201cbear\u201d in Celtic, is also rooted in mythology. King Arthur is a legendary figure who was head of the kingdom Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table in medieval times.  While Will and Kate waited four days before revealing their new baby\u2019s name, that didn\u2019t keep British oddsmakers from making predictions (Albert and Arthur were early favorites). William also teased his son\u2019s name as he left the hospital. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d he said with a smile.

Not only are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle set to tie the knot in May, but also Kate Middleton is pregnant with her third child with Prince William.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced that they were expecting another royal baby back in September, an addition that will expand their current brood of two to three. Middleton gave birth to her first child with William, Prince George, on July 22, 2013. Their daughter, Princess Charlotte, followed nearly two years later on May 2, 2015.  Their Royal Highnesses are choosing to not reveal the baby\u2019s gender, as they did before both Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born. However, some fans speculate that Kate Middleton and Prince William\u2019s 2017 Christmas Card\u2014which featured a photo of the family all dressed in blue\u2014was a hint that they are expecting a boy.  Here\u2019s everything we know about Kate Middleton\u2019s pregnancy, due date and the new royal baby.  When is Kate Middleton due?

About a week later on Oct. 17, the Palace divulged that Kate Middleton is due is sometime in April 2018, just before Princess Charlotte\u2019s third birthday. This means that royal baby number three will be here before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attend the BAFTAs at Royal Albert Hall on February 18, 2018. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images:  The third royal baby\u2019s gender may still be a mystery, but London-based bookmaker William Hill is betting on another girl for Kate and William. The bookie has set royal baby names odds at 3/1 for Mary, with Alice close behind at 6/1, Victoria at 10/1 and Elizabeth at 14/1.  The name Diana has been given royal baby name odds of 20/1, indicating there is also some speculation that the Duke and Duchess will pay tribute to their child\u2019s late grandmother, Princess Diana.  On the other hand, if the royal baby turns out to be a boy, Arthur is the current favorite at 12/1, with Frederick at 14/1 and James at 16/1.  How could the royal baby make history?  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge at Germany's Hamburg airport on July 21, 2017. Karwai Tang/WireImage:  The third royal baby could make history by becoming fifth in line to the British throne regardless of its gender. Thanks to the 2013 passing of the Succession to the Crown Act to end the system of male preference primogeniture\u2014which had been in place since the Act of Settlement of 1701\u2014a boy baby would be the first prince not to take precedence over his older sister in the line of succession.  The law came into effect in 2015, meaning Princess Charlotte will remain fourth in line to the crown whether she gets a younger brother or a younger sister in April. However, Prince Harry will still move down to sixth in line after his new niece or nephew is born.  What can we expect when the royal baby is born?

Just like when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stopped for a few quick photos in front of the hospital before they returned to Kensington Palace with their new prince. Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she\u2019s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.  Getty Images  The red dress appeared to be a nod to the outfit Princess Diana wore when she introduced Prince Harry to the world in 1984. Both dresses were bright red with a white Peter Pan collar.  Getty Images  This wasn't the first time Kate paid homage to her late mother-in-law after giving birth. Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.  Getty Images  When Princess Charlotte arrived in May 2015, Duchess Kate opted for another pastel Jenny Packham number, but this time her yellow dress in a buttercup print had longer sleeves to accommodate for the cooler spring weather just like the red dress did today.

        "doc_1_text": "The timeless question that every parent must confront: how do we want to raise our children? To be happy, down-to-earth, and well-adjusted to the real world, most of us would say. Turns out that\u2019s exactly what the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge would say too.  Raising them her way  Mum Kate Middleton is definitely taking a no-nonsense approach to parenting, according to RadarOnline.com\u2019s palace sources. Far from being spoilt by attention, 3-year-old Prince George and 2-year-old Princess Charlotte \u201chave absolutely no idea that they\u2019re royals\u201d.  \u201cThey might look like perfect tots in photos, but at home they play in the mud, fall off ponies, and have screaming tantrums!\u201d That\u2019s a description that no mum of toddlers would be surprised at.  The plucky mum is making sure her tots are raised with all the discipline and levelheadedness that normal children receive \u2014 royal tradition be damned. Kate shields her babies from the public as much as possible, according to one source. She has also told palace aides that \u201cher kids will be raised her way\u201d.  \u201cIt would absolutely horrify Elizabeth. But Kate insists the kids should be allowed to be normal children. Never in royal history have the children in direct line to the throne been raised in such a modern way.\u201d  Kate is clearly drawing lessons from her own middle-class upbringing \u2014 her mum Carol was an air hostess with British Airways while her father Michael was a flight dispatcher.  And the dauntless mum is proving that she isn\u2019t shy about defying centuries of royal tradition, all for the sake of her kids. Kate and William have reportedly enrolled little George in a normal middle-class school in suburban London.  A more orthodox choice would have been William\u2019s first school, Wetherby Prep \u2014 a much more \u201cposh\u201d school.  In today\u2019s fast-changing world, many of us worry about how to prepare our kids for success. Sounds like Kate is taking charge of her little ones\u2019 futures early on!  Parenting rules Kate and William live by  All parents aspire to bring up humble, well-mannered children, and Kate and William certainly have a tougher job than most. So far, it\u2019s been amazing to see the couple\u2019s dedication to making sure their kids will grow up down-to-earth and gracious \u2014 royal or not.  Here are some great insights that the royal mum and dad have given into their parenting approach over the years:  Taking a break  \u201cTime out\u201d is a common method of discipline that parents turn to \u2014 Kate calls it \u201ctaking a break\u201d instead. When little George does something naughty, he sits in a corner of his room and plays with a special calming toy or fuzzy book.  Playing music  When prince George throws a royal screaming fit, his parents play his favourite African drumming music. Sounds like a great way to calm down wailing toddlers without exhausting yourself!  Imitating his tantrums  Kate has an even more creative solution to little George\u2019s tantrums. When he throws a tantrum on the floor, the Duchess doesn\u2019t hesitate to get down and scream along. (Which mum hasn\u2019t been tempted to do that?) George finds this hilarious and it calms him right down.  Helping to clean up  Like all parents, Kate and William are no stranger to mealtime battles \u2014 flinging food on the floor, barfing sounds, the works. If George does this, the rule is that he must help clean up and won\u2019t get a replacement meal, only milk.  Less things, please  Prince William refused to divulge what gifts three-year-old Prince George received on his birthday in 2016, \u201cI am not telling, he got too many things, he\u2019s far too spoiled.\u201d  While they certainly have the means to pamper their tots with material goods, the royal parents are clearly determined that George and Charlotte will grow up to value more important things in life.  Giving them a normal life  Speaking to GQ last month, William revealed how dearly he valued normalcy for his children. \u201cI want George to grow up in a real, living environment, I don\u2019t want him growing up behind palace walls, he has to be out there. The media make it harder but I will fight for them to have a normal life.\u201d  Like all parents, family is the centre of his world for this dad. \u201cI could not do my job without the stability of the family. Stability at home is so important to me. I want to bring up my children in a happy, stable, secure world.\u201d  Being a Modern Old-Fashioned Mom  One of Kate\u2019s go-to parenting guides is apparently The Modern Mother\u2019s Handbook: How To Raise A Happy, Healthy, Smart, Disciplined and Interesting Child, Starting From Birth. The anonymous author calls herself a Modern Old-Fashioned Mom, and her book offers no-nonsense tips for raising kids from bubs to teens.  Some gems include \u201cset a good example and then stand back and watch\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t force your kids to do things\u201d. Definitely a page-turner if you\u2019re wondering how to square up traditional values with modern changes for your little ones.

A statement released by Kensington Palace on Twitter reads, \"Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news.\" Kate's morning sickness was also mentioned in the statement, as an explanation for her absence at upcoming events: \"As with her previous two pregnancies, the Duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. Her Royal Highness will no longer carry out her planned engagement at the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London today. The Duchess is being cared for at Kensington Palace.\"  X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The renovation proposal claimed that the nearly 5,000-square-foot expansion would \"free up the palace suites for the Royal Family\" and is \"required to allow for the accommodation of administration which must necessarily be moved out of rooms leased from the Royal Household in Kensington Palace.\" It would also free up a ton of space for a new nursery and multiple playrooms\u2014just saying.",

The Duke of Cambridge jokingly told student Grace Gunn, 19, that she might see him 'sooner' than she thought when the pair met yesterday at the east London-based Spitalfields Crypt Trust.  As he said his goodbyes, William, 35, said to the teenager: 'All the best with the midwifery - might see you sooner than you think.'  It came after the royal let slip last week that he had been 'a bit anxious to start with but [we can] start celebrating this week,' suggesting the Duchess of Cambridge might be further along in her pregnancy than previously speculated.  Slip of the tongue? Prince William jokingly told a trainee midwife that she might see him 'sooner' than she thought as he visited an east London charity yesterday, pictured  Kate, 35, is planning to make her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy more than two weeks ago. Pictured, during her last official appearance on August 30  Meanwhile Kate, 35, who was last seen in public on August 30, appears to be preparing to return to royal duties after taking time off due to severe morning sickness.  Kensington Palace today named the duchess as one of the co-hosts of a Buckingham Palace reception due to be held next month.  Alongside Princes William and Harry, she is set to welcome guests to an event celebrating the contribution of those working in the mental health sector.  The development suggests the duchess is starting to see an improvement in her health after she was struck down with Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), a complication that causes excessive nausea and vomiting which Kate suffered during her first two pregnancies.  The illness meant Kate and William were forced to make an early pregnancy announcement a fortnight ago.  As William said his goodbyes at the Spitalfields Crypt Trust yesterday, pictured, he told a trainee midwife: 'All the best with the midwifery - might see you sooner than you think'  Since then the Duchess has been forced to miss a number of planned engagements, including her son's Prince George's first day of school, because of the condition.  However, her husband, Prince William, told well-wishers that she was 'doing well' during a visit to Liverpool earlier this month.  Last week he also appeared to let slip at the time that Kate was 11 weeks pregnant. This would mean the baby could be due as early as March next year.  While supporters are eagerly awaiting the duchess' return to public life, they were treated to new images of the royal when she appeared in a charity video about children's mental health that was released earlier this week.  Growing family: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with George and Charlotte during their European tour, are preparing to welcome their third child together next year  On Monday Kate launched the 'You're never too young to talk mental health' campaign by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families.  In a video recorded in January, several months before she is believed to have fallen pregnant, Kate urged parents to encourage their children to be 'open about their feelings'.  Donning a \u00a31,600 Eponine blue coat, the well-spoken duchess also called on people to speak out when they have feelings that are 'too big to manage on our own'.  The campaign, which aims to promote mental health awareness in schools, includes a video introduction from Kate, which she recorded on a visit to the Child Bereavement UK Centre in East London in January this year.",

        "doc_2_text": "Princess Kate knew what was coming.  Having battled severe pregnancy sickness, or Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), while expecting her first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the royal mom would have been told by her medical team that the odds meant she would likely have the debilitating condition again.  Caitlin Dean, who is chairperson of the U.K.\u2019s Pregnancy Sickness Support, is also a mother of three who suffered from HG in each of her pregnancies.  \u201cA lot of people go into the second [pregnancy] hoping that it will not happen again, thinking [HG] will be one pregnancy and that every pregnancy is different,\u201d says Dean. \u201cBut once you have it twice, that delusion is pretty much blown out of the water. So you have to prepare and be ready for this.  \u201cFor myself, I found it mentally and physically easier [during subsequent pregnancies] because I knew that I was going to have this and I knew what to expect from the treatment and what to expect generally.\u201d  Lia Toby/WENN  On the flip side, she notes, for some women the symptoms \u201cget worse each time.\u201d  Dean says that for women who have previously battled HG, there\u2019s a trepidation mixed in with the joy of anticipating a new baby.  \u201cYou know it\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s quite a scary prospect knowing you\u2019re going to put yourself through that again. Certainly for me and my husband that was a huge decision. Not so much, \u2018Let\u2019s have a third kid,\u2019 but, \u2018Can we go through HG again?\u2019 It\u2019s certainly something that limits a lot of people who cannot go beyond two because of the condition.  \u201cPreparing makes a huge amount of difference,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we suspect from experience is that if you prepare, you can start pre-emptive treatment and can prepare your household and your finances. The average woman doesn\u2019t have the life that Kate has with people to cook meals and people to do their cleaning for them and look  after their children. For regular women that preparation is absolutely key.\u201d  Such advance preparation, she adds, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily improve the sickness, although there is evidence that earlier treatment can reduce the overall impact of the symptoms. It isn\u2019t a cure, but it makes it easier to have done that preparation. Then, if you don\u2019t have HG on the third time, you haven\u2019t lost anything. [That scenario] would be brilliant. Very occasionally women don\u2019t get it again, but most of the time they do.\u201d  Preparing also means keeping your younger children informed, says Dean, who wrote How To Be an HG Hero aimed at children of expectant moms.  Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage  \u201cThe idea with that is to help children understand why Mummy\u2019s not in the picture and why she\u2019s potentially in and out of hospital and how they can help,\u201d says Dean. \u201cMy key thing is honesty. A lot of people try to hide the fact they\u2019re pregnant in the first 12 weeks, because they\u2019re worried about having to explain a miscarriage if it happens. If you are going in and out of hospital and lying in bed day after day and not telling your kids the reason why, they\u2019re just going to worry about it and make up in their own heads why that is. Kids are resilient and they get on with that as long as you tell them the truth.  \u201cIt is debilitating and miserable and hopefully [Kate\u2019s] children will not be worrying about it and understand that Mummy\u2019s poorly.\u201d  Samir Hussein/WireImage  Of course, it\u2019s also tough on moms. \u201cYou have the fact that your other children are going to lose out on Mummy, and you have that guilt at not being able to spend so much time with them.\u201d  As for treatment, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include a first line of medication like Cyclizine, which is an anti-histamine and works to combat vomiting, and Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting.  \u201cOn top of that, it is IV fluids \u00adif she\u2019s not keeping food or fluids down,\u201d says Dean, who is not involved in Kate\u2019s treatment. \u201cThe main things is to keep her hydrated and able to eat. We know that malnutrition and dehydration can have a negative effect on the fetus. The idea that baby\u2019s fine with a starving mum just isn\u2019t true. It is important to keep mums hydrated so that they can eat as much as they need to or are able to.\u201d",

        "doc_1_text": "Prince George of Cambridge knows exactly what he wants for Christmas \u2014 and he isn't messing around. During Prince William's visit to Finland, he presented Santa Claus with Prince George's Christmas list. Not only does this mean the public gets to experience George's handwriting for the first time, but we also have further insight into the 4-year-old royal's wishes and dreams for the perfect holiday.  In his letter, not only did George circle that he has been \"nice,\" rather than \"naughty\" this year, but he wrote down he wants a \"police car.\" He even signed his name (just \"George\") at the bottom.  According to Hello! Canada, William told Santa at the Christmas market in Helsinki, \"I've seen you and I had to give you this letter.\" He then added about his son, \"He hasn't written down many requests, so I think one request is probably OK.\" William also made sure Santa paid attention to how George was \"nice\" this year. \"He's been a nice boy, a nice boy,\" he said.  George had the opportunity to list five presents he wanted for Christmas, but didn't. He only wrote down one item \u2014 and an important one at that. You have you to admire his definitiveness. Unlike many children, he didn't list a bunch of different gifts. Maybe he's hoping that by including one only thing it ensures he'll actually get it?  It's unclear if George is wishing for an actual police car or a toy version, but it seems more than likely he wants the latter \u2014 and that's what he'll probably receive on Dec. 25. It's highly doubtful his parents \u2014 oops Santa, will gift him with his own police car that he can't even drive.  Either way, the fact that he has only one gift request speaks volumes. He clearly isn't greedy. Yes, he's a prince and is given luxuries that many aren't privy to, so maybe he already had so much stuff that the one thing missing from his life is a police car. Though, William and Kate Middleton seem to be raising their children to be appreciative of what they have in life, all while wanting them to have a \"normal\" of a life as possible.  As William once said about his children in a May interview with British GQ, \"I couldn't do my job without the stability of the family. Stability at home is so important to me. I want to bring up my children in a happy, stable, secure world, and that is so important to both of us as parents.\" He then added about his son, \"I want George to grow up in a real, living environment, I don't want him growing up behind palace walls, he has to be out there. The media make it harder but I will fight for them to have a normal life.\"  The 35-year-old activist was also quick to recognize he and his family don't live the average life. After being asked, \"But surely you must accept it as an abnormal life?\", he responded, \"Totally, but I can still try to protect them as children.\"  Based on George's wish list for Christmas, it's probably safe to say that William's hopes of ensuring both George and Princess Charlotte remain children as long as possible is a reality. So many kids these days want huge gifts, like smartphones, tablets, computers, or video game systems, so to see that George seemingly wants a toy car shows his innocence \u2014 and it's truly refreshing.  The fact that George opened up his Christmas gifts early in December 2016, according to Kiss FM DJ AJ King (via Hello!) also shows just how much a kid he remains at heart. \"I had a really nice chat with Prince William who told me that this was their last week at work, as it were, before Christmas,\" King said. \"[William] said they were all really excited about it and that George is already opening his presents. He thought it a quite funny. That's kids for you, even the ones that are princes!\"  As for Charlotte, it's unclear what she wants for Christmas. Whatever she's hoping for is probably as sweet and childlike as her older brother's wish.",

'They've been at each other's throats and fighting over the littlest things ever since Mary-Kate broke the news to Ashley that she and Olivier are trying for a baby,' a source claimed to the publication. 'They put up a good front at the fashion show, but behind-the-scenes it was a nightmare.'  'Ashley is absolutely furious,' the source adds.

Mary-Kate and Olivier had a desire to start a family shortly after they began dating, Star claims.

But, the thought of Mary-Kate getting pregnant before her left Ashley 'seething with jealousy.'  'Ashley is so used to them doing everything together,' a source dishes to Star. 'I'm sure she thought they'd get pregnant at the same time!'  According to Star's outrageous report, Ashley feels left out. Plus, being a twin means that Mary-Kate's chances of conceiving multiple babies at the same time could leave Ashley twice as heartbroken.  'Her friends don't believe she'll want any part of any baby shower,' a source told the publication. 'It would just be a reminder of everything her sister has that she doesn't.'  Neither Ashley or Mary-Kate have responded to Star's allegations.",

After touching down at the airport in a white Alexander McQueen ensemble, Middleton and Prince William were greeted by well-wishers en route to the Presidential Palace. (They were sans children, post-Prince George\u2019s less-than-happy arrival.)  Poles greeted the duke and duchess with great enthusiasm, with many presenting the young royals with flowers or gifts. One such token-bearing person reportedly presented the duo with a gift fit for a newborn baby. Reacting in the moment, Middleton apparently joked to her husband, \u201cWe will just have to have more babies.\u201d  Unsurprisingly, the world\u2019s joyous reaction was swift.

According to the National Institutes of Health, the Duchess\u2019s rare condition tends to appear more often in women carrying twins.  So what would it mean for the royal family if Kate, 30 \u2013 who was discharged from the hospital Thursday \u2013 were to deliver two little royals? A pair of heirs?  Nope, royal experts tell PEOPLE. In fact, it\u2019s all a bit complicated.  PHOTOS: Prince William & Kate Middleton\u2019s Pregnancy Clues in 5 Clicks  The firstborn twin would have a completely different path than his or her sibling, says royal historian Robert Lacey, author of The Queen: A Life in Brief: \u201cThe first child to appear will have precedence. Whichever one comes out first will be the heir \u2013 and it will be the call of the obstetrician if there is a caesarean section.\u201d  And the obstetrician will make that delivery based on the location of the babies during labor, Mark Johnson, Professor of Obstetrics at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, tells PEOPLE.  Says Johnson: \u201cIf delivering vaginally, the first baby to enter the pelvis will be delivered first. If delivering by c-section it very much depends on the which baby is closest to the incision, generally that will be the lower of the two babies.\u201d  A year ago, the British government voted to modernize the rule of succession so that in the event of twins, a firstborn girl would not lose the title of heir if a boy were to be subsequently born to the royal couple. But that rule hasn\u2019t been implemented yet.  Under the current law of the land, says Lacey, \u201cIf the twins are a girl first followed by a boy, the boy will be next in succession.\u201d  When or if the law is changed, adds Lacey, \u201cthe boy would be ousted by his sister.\u201d  If Kate is pregnant with twins, William, who will surely be present for the births, will be able to see firsthand which baby is born first. But in the past that wasn\u2019t the case, adds Lacey.  In other eras, \u201cthe Home Secretary was on hand in the hospital to ensure there was no foul play,\u201d says Lacey, \u201csince there were fears that if the firstborn turned out to be a girl, she might get swapped for a substitute baby boy \u2013 and smuggled into the bed in a warming pan.\u201d  PHOTOS: Prince William and Kate\u2019s Lucky Little One: Lupo!",

Unfortunately, given the outlet\u2019s track record, we\u2019re not remotely surprised by the magazine\u2019s latest piece of royal fiction. Last month, Gossip Cop corrected the often disproven magazine when it falsely alleged that Meghan Markle made Middleton a \u201cmiracle\u201d soup to help cure her morning sickness. And prior to her third pregnancy announcement, we called out the tabloid for wrongly claiming in a baseless cover story that Middleton\u2019s third baby had been confirmed by the palace.

Rob Moseley, Loughborough Uni Charles II spent much of his time consorting with a very attractive, extremely buxom, young lady called Nell Gwynne. Maybe our present Charles would welcome such misfortune! David Vickery, Croydon, UK My understanding is that upon accession the Monarch is entitled to be crowned as, and therefore known by, any name (s)he chooses. Hence King George VI (real name, I think, Albert, or Bertie), similarly King Edward VII's real name was I think Albert and King George V's real name was David. The last one does sound a bit unlikely, but I seem to remember reading it somewhere. Similarly, since the death of big bad much maligned Richard III, no-one seems to have been particularly keen to use the name Richard. On the other hand, each royal house has tended to have its preferred first names, so maybe we shouldn't read too much into these things. To answer the question, I don't think Prince Charles would have to change his name but he could if he wanted. Any suggestions for possible names? Cathy, London, UK He wouldn't need to but he could choose to. His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George and he can use whichever one he wants to. Since the last 2 Charleses weren't the greatest kings we've ever had he has said he will be styled George VII should he become King. Matt Stephenson, London, UK Edward VII was christened Albert Edward; George V was George Frederick Ernest Albert; Edward VIII was Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David but he was known as David (wouldn't you want to be with a name like that); George VI was Albert Frederick Arthur George and known as Bertie. As for Charles, what about King Arthur (II)? Graham Ralph, Gravesend, UK 'King Ian' has a nice ring to it... Lara, Bath The answer to the question is no. Charles Philip Arthur George has speculated that he may use his last given name. But remember, Edward VII and George VI, when christened, were not expected to succeed to the throne, as they had elder brothers, Charles was christened in full expectation that he would one day be king. I can't help hoping he will take Arthur as his regnal name. It would sneak one up on fate, which has denied us three Arthurs already - the heirs of Henry II, Henry VII and Victoria were all called Arthur, but never succeeded to the throne. Quentin Langley, Woking UK Queen Victoria did indeed have a son called Arthur but he was not her eldest son and not her heir. He lived well into adulthood and had children of his own. Susan Deal, Sheffield UK No. He would not be required to adopt a different regnal name but, as Matt Stephenson surmises, he probably would. My understanding is that he is happy enough with Charles as a 'personal' name, but that it too redolent of the accursed House of Stuart to be aceptable for regnal purposes. As for his other given names, his relationship with his father is hardly such that he would want to perpetuate him as King Philip (which anyway would be a bit rich as the son of Queen Elizabeth), and although he is a bit barmy, he is not (here I disagree with Quentin Langley) quite barmy enough to want to be King Arthur: can't we imagine the mick-taking that would arise? Would Camilla be the Lady of the Lake, and who would be his Merlin? That leaves the traditional choice of \"George VII\": boring and conventional - but what do we expect of the Hanoverians? Bernard Cross, Hemel Hempstead England    Add your answer              ",

Being a normal girl from Berkshire, the former fashion and marketing professional had to adapt to royal life. When she did fall pregnant, Kate was not allowed to have one baby tradition other mothers in the UK will experience, a baby shower. Another royal baby is now on the way, with Meghan Markle having her first child with husband Prince Harry. With Meghan now pregnant, and hailing from the US where baby showers are the norm, will Meghan be allowed what Kate wasn\u2019t?  Kate Middleton: The pregnancy tradition Kate was not allowed to have - will Meghan be?  Baby showers are a way for the expectant mother and those close to her to celebrate the pregnancy and upcoming birth. This happens by showering the mother-to-be with gifts, a pregnancy tradition. However, baby showers are reported to be frowned on in the Royal Family and not celebrated, as they appear to be tasteless. Speaking to People magazine, royal expert Victoria Arbiter revealed that a royal baby shower could come with \u201cadded pressure that they are clearly very wealthy.\u201d She stated: \u201cA lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate... there's nothing they can't go out and buy themselves\". It is believed that Kate hasn\u2019t had a baby shower for any of her three children.  Kate has been pregnant three times, and is believed to have never had a baby shower  Back in 2013 when she was pregnant with Prince George, rumours circulated that her sister Pippa had thrown her a shower. However, these rumours were shot down by many royal experts, as the point of a shower is to receive gifts and that is something the Royal Family wouldn\u2019t do. According to Victoria, royal protocol exists around gift giving and any gifts given to expectant royal parents must be \u201crespectfully returned\u201d. This means it is highly unlikely that Meghan will be having a baby shower to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first child, despite it being a US tradition. While on their royal tour of Australia, Tonga and Fiji, Meghan and Harry did receive some gifts, including a stuffed toy kangaroo and a pair of tiny Ugg boots.

The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news, which has been met with excitement from Prince Harry. Multiple sources have speculated that Kate wants four children, but she has reportedly decided to have another baby straight away to be able to return to work by late 2019. Kate's body has bounced back well after having Prince Louis just three months ago, and she is said to be ready to produce another heir. The news comes amid reports that Kate and Meghan Markle's friendship has strengthened in recent months, with Meghan seeing Kate as a 'pillar of support' as she continues to face embarrassment from her estranged father Thomas Markle. Kate has reportedly 'penned a pregnancy food list for Meghan' and is advising her on how to balance motherhood with life as a royal. Meghan is hoping for one of each \u2013 a boy and a girl \u2013 and the duchesses will raise the cousins as one big happy family. Multiple birth expert Helen Turier has said that older women are more likely to have multiple birth babies, which could explain why Meghan may be more likely to have twins at 37. As for Harry, he hinted during a walkabout in Ireland last month that he might not want a super-sized family.",

News reports, Prince William was surprisingly candid about the role his mother would play in his children\u2019s lives if she were still around.  \u201cShe\u2019d be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare.\u201d  There is no doubt, he said, that she would love her grandchildren to the Moon and back. But William also said that she would spoil them rotten, much like your own grandmother likely did to you.  \u201cShe\u2019d come in probably at bath time, cause an amazing\u2026 scene, bubbles everywhere, bathwater all over the place, and then leave.\u201d  It may sound just like the normal parent/grandparent relationship to your ears. But coming from the Royal Family, that type of thing is borderline shocking.  Back when Prince William and Prince Harry were young boys, Princess Diana\u2019s parenting style was hands-on to an almost shocking degree. Sure, she had nannies to do the \u201cheavy lifting,\u201d such as changing dirty diapers and such. But her level of involvement with her sons was leaps and bounds more direct than that of any other Royal in history.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRINCESS DIANA\u2019S 57TH BIRTHDAY TODAY Today would have been Princess Diana\u2019s 57th birthday. It is 21 years since she passed away but her legacy lives on through her boys Prince William and Prince Harry.

She took them to theme parks. She involved them in her personal causes. She let them wear jeans and baseball caps and eat at McDonald\u2019s.  That type of hands-on parenting, typical for just about every last parent in the Kingdom but unheard-of for Royals, is now being practiced by William and Kate. Kate, for example, has been known to sit and supervise her children herself while her husband is here or there, doing royal duties. And of course, though she, too, has a team of nannies at her disposal, she\u2019s been known to do much of the heavy lifting herself.  For William, it\u2019s all about balance. His oldest son, Prince George, will almost certainly be the King of England someday, and there is no escaping that.  That means that George and his siblings won\u2019t be able to avoid much of the trappings of royalty. For example, George\u2019s younger brother, Louis, was baptized wearing a replica satin-and-lace gown that mirrored the one worn by Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest daughter back in 1841.  An unnamed Royal source says that William and Kate are trying to find the perfect balance between keeping them connected to their centuries-old royal heritage, and as much of a \u201cnormal\u201d life as possible.",

        "doc_1_text": "Prince George of Cambridge, a future king currently living as a carefree tot in a royal palace, turns 5 years old on Sunday, giving British royal fans a chance to remember with fondness the day this much-wanted heir came into the world. And to celebrate the occasion, George's parents, Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge, released his official birthday portrait Saturday. The picture was taken in the garden at Clarence House on July 9, following the christening of his baby brother, Prince Louis.  Prince Louis has been getting most of the attention lately, what with his christening and the usual round of celebrations surrounding that.  But George is the star of the royal show this week, as third in line to the throne behind his father, Prince William, and his grandfather, Prince Charles the Prince of Wales. He's not the oldest of Queen Elizabeth II's seven great-grandchildren, but he's the one most likely to be a king, some day in the far future.  Plus, he's undeniably cute and sometimes adorably naughty, as his public appearances attest to.  There are so many examples of cute pictures to pick from but here are some favorites:  Chattering George:  At the annual Trooping the Colour parade on June 9, Prince George and his cousin Savannah Phillips watched from the Buckingham Palace balcony, but George's chattering prompted amusing efforts by Savannah to get him to pipe down. Prince William, for one, occasionally looked exasperated at their antics.  Runaround George:  Like any 5-year-old, George is very active. George and sister Princess Charlotte and a clutch of other kids watched over by mum Duchess Kate wore themselves out running around and playing on the grass at one of his father's charity polo matches on June 10, in Gloucester.  George in charge:  It was baby sister Princess Charlotte's big day \u2013 her christening at Sandringham on July 5, 2015 \u2013 but George, strutting around the baby carriage, was the focus of all the media cameras.  George the media skeptic:  Like his father, Prince George has been known to direct a skeptical look at the media cameras, as he did at the Warsaw airport during an official visit to Poland on July 17, 2017.  George the diplomat:  George behaved with aplomb at his first official meet-and-greet, when he stayed up past bedtime to shake hands with visiting President Barack Obama at Kensington Palace on April 22, 2016.  George the would-be pilot:  The little prince is as enamored of flying machines as his dad, thus his delight at getting to explore a real helicopter at the Hamburg airport during an official visit to Germany in July 2017.  George the insouciant prince:  First day of school? Was he nervous? Didn't seem so when he was snapped with his father on steps at Kensington Palace, his feet casually crossed, a big grin on his face, as he prepared to leave for his first day of school in September 2017.  George the animal lover:  Baby royals and baby critters \u2013 put them together and you can't go wrong. For his first overseas tour with his parents Down Under in April 2014, George made his debut at his first-ever public engagements, including being introduced to a cute little marsupial named George at the Prince George Bilby Exhibit, named for the little prince. He seemed pleased but the photographers were even more delighted.  0  1  KIRO",

Kate always hoped for a fourth baby to complete their family - especially now that her sister Pippa is set to give birth to her first child and Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are preparing to welcome twins - but wasn't 'intending to get pregnant so soon after giving birth', explains the royal insider, adding that she and William are taking it in their stride.  'This wasn't part of their plan, but their both so excited.'  The exciting news is made even better by the fact that sister-in-law Meghan Markle is already expecting her first child.  'Meghan conceived just a few weeks after Kate,' a royal source told In Touch, and claims that because Meghan is having multiples, 'they're likely to arrive earlier - which means her due date is around the same time as Kate's.'  'The could give birth on the same day!' a palace insider adds.  According to the publication bombshell report, both duchesses, 36, are preparing to raise the royal cousins as part of 'one big, happy family.'  An insider said, 'Kate and Meghan bonded over the men they married. Now they're bonding over being pregnant together.'  While the pregnancies are the subject of plenty of palace buzz, In Touch reveals the duchesses have only shared the news with close family and friends.  For Meghan, the US publication claims the pregnancy is not just a huge joy but an 'enormous relief.'  'She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,' a palace insider says, not only because of her age but 'because it didn't happen with her first husband,' producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.  Related: Confirmed: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - 'Yes, it's twins!'  Getty  While the royal couple have already shared the news with their immediate families, it will be a long time before they tell the public.  Just like with their first three children, 'Kate and William will wait as long as possible before making an official announcement,' says the insider.  But in the meantime, 'Kate's hoping for another girl. She's telling people, 'I want Charlotte to have a sister!' William however would love another boy.'  Kate, adds the source, is 'convinced she's having another girl because she's having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.'  But, most importantly the couple want a healthy baby.  'They're both over the moon.'

Fitness enthusiast Meghan, whose mother Doria Ragland is a yoga instructor, is returning the favour by teaching Kate pregnancy yoga.  The publication adds that the two pregnant women are happily letting their husbands dote on them.  'William is doing his best to help Kate relax by being a hands-on father to George, Louis and Charlotte,' says the source.

        "doc_2_text": "George Clooney is opening up about becoming a father to twins, revealing to The Hollywood Reporter details of the birth and denying that he and wife Amal used fertility drugs to become pregnant.  In THR\u2019s cover story, the Suburbicon director says the couple never really discussed children while they were dating and didn\u2019t broach the subject until sometime after their 2014 wedding.  \u201cIt had never been part of my DNA,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn\u2019t want them. And then, after the wedding, Amal and I were talking and we just felt we\u2019d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we\u2019ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.\u201d  Amal became pregnant in 2016, and Clooney was with her in London when they went to the doctor for an ultrasound. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Well, there\u2019s one.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Great.\u2019 And then he goes, \u2018And there\u2019s the second one.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018What?\u2019 We just sat there, staring at that piece of paper they give you, and I kept thinking there was a mistake.\u201d  The couple welcomed a boy and a girl, named Alexander and Ella, on June 6, a month premature, at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, the same hospital where Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s children were born. Alexander was born one minute and 49 seconds before Ella; Clooney reveals to THR (the first media outlet to see the babies up close) that Alexander weighed five and a half pounds, while Ella was four and a half pounds. The twins have dual British and American nationality.  Clooney, at age 56, says of his reaction to the birth: \u201cIt was wild. You know, everything is conceptual until it\u2019s real. It\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re going to be parents, yeah.\u2019 And all of a sudden you go: \u2018Holy shit. I\u2019m a parent!\u2019?\u201d  While Clooney admits that both parents are \u201cunrested,\u201d he was surprised to find that he\u2019s good at changing diapers.  Contrary to tabloid reports, Clooney denies that the duo used fertility drugs to become pregnant \u2014 speculation that likely arose due to Amal\u2019s age and the multiple births. (Women who are age 35 and older are considered of \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d by the medical community.) Asked if she wants more children, Amal demurred: \u201cI\u2019m 39. I already had them quite late.\u201d  Fatherhood is both emotional and scary, \u201call of those things,\u201d Clooney added. \u201cThe first thing you think is, \u2018I hope I don\u2019t screw this up.\u2019 I mean, look, we are all responsible for things in life, and Amal and I are responsible for each other in a way \u2014 we look out for one another and we care about one another. But you are really responsible for two kids. I want them to be happy. I want them to have a sense of humor. I want them to be interested in things. I want them to be compassionate about other people\u2019s plights. Because that\u2019s the thing, you know? You have to have some sort of empathy.\u201d  Meanwhile, Clooney also has been dealing with invasive paparazzi trying to get photos of the babies. In July, he lashed out after photos of the twins plastered on the cover of France\u2019s Voici magazine and made the rounds online.  \u201cOver the last week photographers from Voici magazine scaled our fence, climbed our tree and illegally took pictures of our infants inside our home,\u201d Clooney said in a statement at the time. \u201cMake no mistake the photographers, the agency and the magazine will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The safety of our children demands it.\u201d  The photos feature blurry images of the Clooneys, each of them carrying one of their infants, that were snapped in Lake Como, Italy, where Clooney has a home. The magazine touts the images as the first photos of the twins. (An official photo has yet to be released.)  \u201cEvery single day there\u2019s some crazy sort of infringement,\u201d he tells THR. \u201cAnd you go, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll eat it. That\u2019s what we have to do.\u2019 But when someone breaks the law, that\u2019s beyond what we bargained for, beyond the pact I made: that when you\u2019re famous, you\u2019re going to be followed. I don\u2019t know anyone who wouldn\u2019t be furious.\u201d  Next up: Clooney is promoting his new film, Suburbicon, a drama set in the late 1950s that he directed and co-wrote with Grant Heslov starring Matt Damon and Julianne Moore. The Paramount release debuted Saturday at the Venice Film Festival.  Read more about Clooney in THR\u2019s cover story.",

'The truth is Carole is a caring and devoted mother to Kate,' an insider scandalously spilled to the publication. 'Kate depends on her for help and advice - not Charles, who is awkward, or Camilla, who would rather drink wine.'  The claims continue, with GLOBE stating Prince Charles has insisted he should final say in how the royal babies are brought up - including George, 4, and Charlotte, 3.  'The family rift was all too evident when Charles an Camilla neglected to send William and Kate flowers, a note of congratulations or gifts for their new prince!' a source said.  According to GLOBE's bombshell accusations, William reportedly told Charles: 'You ruined my childhood, but I won't let you destroy Louis' - or George's or Charlotte's!'

These boys-only skiing trips are a thing of the past.\"  \"Kate wears the trousers in their marriage,\" the alleged insider further purports, before adding that the mother of 3-year-old George and 1-year-old Charlotte found her husband's behavior \"humiliating and William will be made to pay.\"  No Kensington Palace reps have responded to the news. As reported before, Prince William skipped a Commonwealth Day service to enjoy a lads-only holiday.

As such, we\u2019re hearing that sources close to the royals are now alleging that Kate Middleton wants Prince William to go to couple\u2019s therapy with her.  Couple\u2019s therapy works for some marriages, and doesn\u2019t work for others \u2013 but this is THE royal marriage we\u2019re talking about. Prince William\u2019s marriage to Kate Middleton is probably the most scrutinized marriage in the world, especially right now, and that attention will only make the idea of couple\u2019s therapy more difficult to pull off.  For example, what therapist should they go to? What facility? Does the therapist come to the palace? Any way they try to slice this, the press getting even a whiff of this would lead to widespread speculation that Prince William and Kate Middleton are getting a divorce.  Right now, the palace press office is in overdrive trying to fix Prince William\u2019s disastrous image, thanks to his Swiss rendezvous last week and clear disregard for protocol, tradition, or basic decency. His marriage to Kate Middleton is also clearly in tatters as a result, and any other wife might have left by know. However, Kate Middleton has worked most of her adult life to become a princess (they don\u2019t call her waity Katie for nothing), and it\u2019s going to take a lot more than this for her to throw that all away.  Besides, Prince William has always been extraordinary stubborn about getting what he wants, and he never, ever seems to learn from his mistakes. While his family likely instilled some sense of guilt into him after last week, he\u2019s probably already reverted to behaving the way he always does \u2013 that is, with disregard to his reputation and his wife, and a lack of understanding towards the way royals are expected to behave. He thinks he\u2019s being \u2018modern\u2019, when really, he\u2019s just being spoiled and stubborn.  What do you guys think of the idea of Prince William and Kate Middleton attending couple\u2019s therapy? Do you think it will help, or that they have already embarked on a slow limp towards divorce?

Prince William's reputation has been in tatters lately, thanks to his Swiss rendezvous and disregard for protocol, and his marriage to Kate Middleton has also been called into question. However, Kate Middleton is known for her resilience and determination, and it is unlikely that she would give up on her marriage so easily. Prince William, on the other hand, has always been stubborn and reluctant to learn from his mistakes, and it is unclear whether couple's therapy would be effective in helping him change his behavior. Ultimately, it is up to the couple to decide whether they want to seek help, and only time will tell whether their marriage will survive the current challenges.",

Even though Kate Middleton isn't traveling with him, the Duchess is clearly on William's mind.  Today, the Duke visited Jerash, an archaeological site and one of Jordan's most popular tourists spots.

        "doc_2_text": "Only last summer, Duchess Kate of Cambridge was heard telling someone about having \"more babies\" and everyone thought she was just joking. She wasn't: That September, the palace confirmed she was expecting her third royal baby. Kate, 36, gave birth to a boy Monday, who came in at a healthy 8 pounds, 7 ounces.  Here are some of the reasons why this matters:  The succession: The new prince alters the line for the throne. He is now fifth behind sister Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, 2, brother Prince George of Cambridge, 4, father Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, 35, and grandfather Prince Charles, 68, the Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son.  With George and Charlotte as their generation's \"heir and spare,\" the new baby becomes another spare but in a new era of recent changes in succession law that make royal birth order more important than gender.  Gannett-cdn - https://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/responsive/graphics/2018/04/royal-succession/index.html  So the baby prince (royal fans began immediately speculating about names), will follow Charlotte not jump ahead of her. And if it had been another girl, she would not lose her place to a younger brother who might follow.  Uncle Prince Harry, 33, moves down to sixth in line, while great-uncle Prince Andrew, the queen's second son, moves down to seventh. His daughters, Princess Beatrice and Eugenie, move down to eighth and ninth respectively, and the queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, moves to 10th.  The memory of Diana: No one would have been more thrilled about another baby than Diana, a woman described by her sons as a wonderful mum who had a special rapport with children. During the weeks of mourning following commemoration of her death, happy pictures of her with her sons were everywhere. People recalled she first came to public attention before her engagement to Prince Charles was announced in 1981 as a London nanny and, in a famous picture, as a nursery school aide clutching toddlers to her hips.  A new baby may have been coincidental but it was an apt reminder that life goes on, turning the page on a new chapter for the royal family and for the Cambridges in particular.  Following thequeen's lead: Will and Kate may be on their way to imitating his grandparents in family size, which would make them relative rarities as royal heirs.  The queen, 92, and Prince Philip, 96, have four children, but aside from them, no others in the close line of succession have had more than two kids. The birth order of Will and Kate's children follows that of the Queen's children too: boy, girl, boy. The queen's grandfather, King George V, who died in 1936, had six children.  Prince George: The nation's favorite 4-year-old started school at Thomas's Battersea last fall, a milestone his mother had to miss due to a recurrence of her acute morning sickness with Baby No. 3. Prince William accompanied him, followed by a small press pool in hopes avoiding a repeat of the mob scenes that surrounded Will and Harry's first days of school with Diana back in the 1980s.  Acute morning sickness explained: What is hyperemesis gravidarum?  Prince Harry: He's thrilled about the new baby. Soon after the announcement, during a visit to Manchester, he was asked about the new heir and told reporters, \"Fantastic. Great. Very, very happy for them.\"  Although he moves down further in the succession, Harry was still required by law to get the permission of the queen to marry American actress Meghan Markle, 36, on May 19 at Windsor Castle. (The 245-year-old law that required all royals to get the monarch's permission changed in 2013 to include only the first six in line.)  Prince Andrew: The new baby means the Duke of York, the 58-year-old second son of the queen and Prince Philip, no longer has to get the queen's permission to remarry \u2014 even if he and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, get hitched again. The two are still close, sharing the same royal mansion for years even though they divorced in 1996, but they have always denied they plan to remarry.  Recovery in nice digs:  Last year, Will and Kate and their children returned full-time to Kensington Palace, where Will and Harry grew up with Diana after her separation and divorce from Prince Charles. The Cambridges had been living at their country retreat in Norfolk, where Prince George attended a Montessori nursery school, and near where Will had a part-time job as a helicopter pilot for an air ambulance service.  William gave up his pilot job to become a full-time member of the royal firm and has been undertaking more responsibilities on behalf of the queen and Prince Philip, who retired from official life in 2017.",
        "generated_text": "The royal family is expanding with the birth of Kate Middleton and Prince William's third child, a boy who was born on Monday and is fifth in line for the throne. The new prince follows his sister, Princess Charlotte, and brother, Prince George, and will not jump ahead of Charlotte, even if it is a girl. The baby's birth matters for succession as it affects the line of succession for the throne. The baby's uncle, Prince Harry, moves down to sixth in line, while great-uncle Prince Andrew moves down to seventh. The baby's grandfather, Prince Charles, is eighth, and his son, Prince Philip, is ninth. The baby's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, is the top of the list.

Venice \ud83d\udc9c A post shared by Amal Clooney (@amalclooney) on Sep 3, 2017 at 8:52am PDT  The latest issue of Star magazine includes an article which says that the actor has been doting on his wife and twins since their birth. The twins are Alexander and Ella, and they were born back in June.  According to Star\u2019s questionable report, the human rights attorney has been somehow put off by her husband\u2019s devotion to their family.  A so-called insider told the same magazine that Amal secretly hopes that the actor will go back to work as soon as possible.

Sometimes she jokes it\u2019s like having three kids!\u2019  Star\u2019s dubious insider continues, \u2018George isn\u2019t coping well with the lack of sleep. So Amal has kindly suggested that he sleep in the guest room so she can get some rest.\u2019  The magazine\u2019s assertion that Amal would be irritated with George being a caring father and husband is, of course, completely bogus and absurd as well.  Gossip Cop even checked with a reliable source, and the magazine\u2019s reports turned out to be ridiculous as they don\u2019t even make sense at all.

Apparently, the Duchess of Cambridge is still rather upset at her husband for humiliating her with his very public and embarrassing child-like behavior this year.  Kate Middleton has put her husband Prince William on a short leash ever since he was caught partying and drinking with topless models during a disastrous ski trip to Verbier, Switzerland earlier this year. While Kate herself managed to go on an all-girls ski trip with her sister Pippa Middleton during that same time, there were no embarrassing videos of her dancing at a nightclub or drinking at bars released on social media.  The last thing Kate Middleton wants is to see her husband, the future King of England, party with models or dance like a fool for the world to see. Even though she\u2019s been trying to hide her frustrations with William by putting a smile on her face in public, their relationship behind closed doors is a different story. The Duchess is hoping that with the right kind of counseling sessions, she can slowly but surely learn how to trust William again.  To make matters worse, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been trying their best to show the world that their marriage is absolutely fine. But, a lot of critics say that the harder they try to appear normal, they end up looking both insincere and staged. Kate Middleton doesn\u2019t want to pull the plug on her royal marriage. At this point, she\u2019s willing to do just about anything to make William focus more on their marriage than his own selfish needs.  Prince William and Kate Middleton rarely look like a happy couple in public. Even though they often smile and wave for the cameras during their royal engagements, their body language speaks volumes. Sure, everyone knows that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have to remain professional whenever they are in public, but that doesn\u2019t mean William should completely ignore his wife or refuse to show her any gestures to say that they are still madly in love with one another.  So far Buckingham Palace has not made any comments about the state of Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s marriage.

The Guardian reports that Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, \"Even the royal family will not be left alone.\" Rashid previously claimed he did nothing wrong but later admitted to encouraging terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they are expecting their first child together. The couple is due in the spring of 2019, according to reports. While the newest addition to the Sussex family isn't due until Spring 2019, Prince William and Duchess Kate will become an aunt and uncle for the first time this fall as Kate's sister Pippa is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews. Pippa was recently seen at Princess Eugenie's wedding, and is thought to be due in the coming weeks. Several members of the royal family, including the Queen and Prince Charles, shared their joy about Meghan's pregnancy this morning.",

According to Life & Style magazine, a dispute has sprung up over a conversation about Kate's royal duties. Prince William had called the Queen to suggest that his wife - who is pregnant with their third child - scale back her royal duties permanently.  'Kate wants her public appearances kept to a minimum and he's 100% behind her' the source told the publication, adding that 'the conversation was quite icy.'  Kate is reportedly more comfortable in her role as a full time mother to George (4) and Charlotte (2) than as a working royal. The Duchess of Cambridge is currently patron to a number of charities, including The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice and Action on Addiction.  Kate Middleton (Image credit: Rex Features (Shutterstock))  But according to Life & Style, 'the 91-year-old monarch was livid that the future Queen would want to lessen her duties.'  The Queen's own experiences as a mother and working royal could be the reason she disapproves of Kate and Will's decision. She was 25 with two small children (Charles and Anne) when her father died and she ascended to the throne, and went on to have two more children (Andrew and Edward) after she was crowned, regularly leaving them at home with nursery staff while she went on official tours of the Commonwealth.  (Image credit: GETTY)  In his 1994 authorised biography, Prince Charles is said to have found his parents 'emotionally reserved.' It was the nursery staff who 'taught him to play, witnessed his first steps, punished and rewarded him, helped him put his first thoughts into words' the biography claimed.  This is not the first parenting style clash between the Queen and younger generations of the royal family. She reportedly disagreed with William's mother Diana's decision to take him on tour to Australia and New Zealand when he was nine months old. Diana was said to have found the idea of being apart from William too difficult.  In a clip from her 90th birthday celebrations last year the Queen was also seen telling William to 'get up' when the family appeared on the balcony to wave at crowds - he was crouching down to show George the planes doing a fly over.  William and Kate have already adopted a more modern attitude to parenting than their parents and grandparents, sending George to a local Montessori nursery in Norfolk and then onto Thomas's in Battersea, where he recently had his first day of school.",

PopSugar posted the image on its Instagram account, and it featured actor George Clooney and his wife, Amal, a professor at Columbia, out and about in Sardinia, Italy. The pair had a date night on Monday at Il Marino di Puntaldia just two days before the first birthday of their twins, Alexander and Ella.  He\u2019s clutching her hand, and she\u2019s wearing a beautiful dragon print dress, while he wore a stylish blue polo shirt with striped pants. While the lovely couple always garners plenty of attention, one thing, in particular, stood out to fans in this picture. Followers quickly pointed out that Amal sported what might be a tiny baby bump in the image.  Instagram user andreal_pez asked, \u201cIs she pregnant again???\u201d Of course, another fan had another possible explanation. A poster with the username carefullycuratedcloset said, \u201cDoes she look a bit preggers or [is] she just having one of THOSE days like the rest of us do??\u201d  It would entirely be horrifying to see pictures of yourself after date night, and immediately see speculation of a possible pregnancy when the truth is you merely sported a food baby after some delicious food.  Last fall, Amal, told the Hollywood Reporter that she doesn\u2019t want to have any more children. She said, \u201cI\u2019m 39. I already had them quite late.\u201d Now, she\u2019s 40 and George is 57, and it doesn\u2019t seem likely that they\u2019ve changed their minds in the few months since last fall with two toddlers in their household even though she praised her husband as a great father \u2014 a fact that appeared to surprise him.  Plus, there\u2019s the fact that George didn\u2019t even plan to have children. He said, \u201cIt had never been part of my DNA. We didn\u2019t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn\u2019t want them. And then, after the wedding, Amal and I were talking and we just felt we\u2019d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we\u2019ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.\u201d  Shortly after deciding to start a family, Amal reportedly got pregnant without the help of fertility drugs, and the couple\u2019s twins came as a big surprise about one month early last June. Could Amal be pregnant again just one year later? Perhaps, but it seems unlikely. However, her dress at the royal wedding a few weeks ago did have some strategic pleating in the midsection.",

The photograph features the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who will be celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary in 2018.\n\nIn other royal news, it was announced that Princess Charlotte will be attending Willcocks Nursery School in London beginning in January. The decision was made because Charlotte will be attending five days a week in the mornings only, and going further away in London would mean she would spend half her day on the commute. Not something a child would want! William and Kate loved Willcocks \"because it's a traditional nursery with high standards.\" The news that Charlotte is starting nursery school next year was announced on Monday, December 18.\n\nOverall, it's been a big year for the royal family, and they are looking forward to celebrating the holiday season with their loved ones.",

(Picture: Backgrid)  Pippa Middleton is due to give birth to her and husband James Matthews\u2019 first child together.  The younger sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, has been spotted out and about in London on a number of occasions lately, sporting her large baby bump.  Pippa and James\u2019 baby will not only have James\u2019 brother Spencer Matthews and his wife Vogue Williams\u2019 son Theodore Fredrick Michael as a cousin, but the unborn child will also have Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis as cousins.  The new arrival will also be the first niece or nephew for both William and Kate, as neither William\u2019s brother Prince Harry or Kate\u2019s brother James Middleton have children.  Pippa Middleton is seen leaving a private members\u2019 gym in Kensington in London this week (Picture: BACKGRID)  The heavily-pregnant sister of Kate Middleton will be giving Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis their first cousin (Picture: BACKGRID)  Pippa confirmed she is pregnant with her first in June, ending months of speculation, revealing the happy news in her Waitrose magazine column.  Opening up about the first three months of her pregnancy, she admitted she\u2019d not suffered the same bad morning sickness her sister had with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.  \u2018I was lucky to pass the 12 week scan without suffering from morning sickness,\u2019 she wrote.

This being my first pregnancy, I had so many questions I felt were still unanswered.\u2019  Pippa also admitted she has had to tone down her exercise regime since falling pregnant too.  She added: \u2018I\u2019ve noticed my body change and weight increase \u2013 but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it\u2019s being strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth and recovery.\u2019  It was first reported that Pippa was expecting her first child in April, with reports at the time claiming she\u2019d had her three-month scan that month and started telling friends and family.  With that in mind, it would mean she is due this month, so she could go into labour any day now.  Writing in her Waitrose Kitchen magazine column, Pippa revealed she has turned to meditation to help her mental well-being in her final stages of pregnancy.

(Picture: Neil Mockford/GC Images)  Pippa and James are preparing to become parents (Picture: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images)  She wrote: \u2018As the final month nears and the bump grows prouder each day, movement is certainly getting more awkward.  \u2018The transformations to my body that are taking place as it prepares for childbirth have meant that the sound sleeps and the baby bubble effect have gone. Reality is finally kicking in.\u2019  Describing her meditation practice, she added: \u2018I was skeptical at first, but after practicing this discipline for the past month I have noticed a huge difference in my mental wellbeing and sense of clarity.  \u2018I signed up to a beginners\u2019 meditation class recently to master the tools essential for performing it effectively.  \u2018This involved learning to meditate twice daily, ideally for 20 minutes, chanting a mantra, while sitting upright, eyes closed and focused. Our teacher stressed that we should ensure we always make time for this because there\u2019s always an excuse not to.  \u2018It\u2019s a good idea to take some well-being time for mummy-to-be now and, most importantly, for the future.\u2019  Kate \u2018could not have been more delighted\u2019, The Sun On Sunday had reported at the time of the news first emerging.

        "doc_2_text": "Did Princess Charlotte recite her great ancestor\u2019s quote unknowingly? Is she advanced for her age?-Know the truths here!  Princess Charlotte and her recital?  National Enquirer this week reported that 4-year-old Princess Charlotte, the youngest and only daughter of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton had randomly recited her grand ancestor, Queen Victoria\u2019s quote.  Queen Victoria had served as the Queen of England from 1837 to her death in 1901. The tabloid wrote that the little royal kid had shocked the palace staff members when she said what Queen Victoria used to say.  Princess Charlotte was playing with a group of toddlers. After she finished playing, it seems that she looked at the royal helpers and said:  \u201cThe important thing is not what they think of me, but what I think of them.\u201d  This quote was used by Queen Victoria in the 19th century.  Gossip Cop has spoken to a royal insider who laughed off at National Enquirer\u2019s story. The insider also denied any such incident in the palace. The source revealed that the story of the tabloid was completely untrue. It is quite unlikely that a kid as small as Princess Charlotte could put together the words to make such a complete and articulate sentence. And then to repeat what was said almost a century ago is very far-fetched.  Is Princess Charlotte advanced for her age?  Last September, Princess Charlotte had accompanied her parents and brother to Canada. At a royal garden party, Princess Charlotte had mingled with other children and toddlers.  Princess Charlotte moved around confidently around the garden lawn and engaged herself with the surroundings. She was just 16 years old when she went to Canada for this tour.  But it was clearly seen that instead of the wobbly walk of any her age child, Princess Charlotte was walking quite sturdily and also was seen running at one point in time.  She preferred balloons over bubbles. At her age, children usually can only mimic simple tasks. But Princess Charlotte was spotted trying to fold her cardigan which is quite a complex task for such a small child.  She seemed to have a good vocabulary at that age. Princess Charlotte was heard saying: dada, flower, and pop (for the balloons).  Paul Kilshaw, 55, the children\u2019s entertainer said:  \u201cCharlotte asked for a flower, I think she said \u2018flower\u2019 because the other little girls were asking for flowers.\u201d  She was not copying others like the other children of her age would but was inventing her own plays. She went and sat on the dog Moose. She also ran towards the balloons and started a game of her own of repeatedly hitting at them.  She also hugged the black and white rabbit around; which reveals her emotional development of passing on the love to an animal.  A spokesperson for the Royal family said:  \u201cThe Duke and Duchess are really pleased to have this opportunity to introduce their children to Canada and it\u2019s great that they have the chance to play with other children while they are here.\u201d  The show-stealer  Charlotte is the show-stealer on most occasions. She seems to have inherited the dark Middleton eyes and her mother\u2019s darker hair.  But she is gradually acquiring the royal genes. Her face now resembles that of her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II when she was small.  Prince William dots on his little one and calls her \u2018the joy from Heaven\u2019. Friends say that the little Princess has a bubbly and confident character, but talking about her daughter, Princess Kate had said:  \u201cShe is very cute but she has got quite a feisty side. George has turned out to be a really lovely little boy. I hope George will keep Charlotte in order!\u201d  Charlotte was the bridesmaid for her maternal aunt, Pippa Middleton at the latter\u2019s wedding on 20th May 2017 to financier James Matthews.  Princess Charlotte looked cute in her tan-and-white dress by Pepa and Co. and had worn a floral headpiece. She was also holding a tiny basket and seemed quite fond of it. The mother-daughter duo made an amazing and beautiful pair!  The little Princess had also stolen the show at the Trooping the Colour Ceremony in June 2017 at the Royal Palace. She was in a pretty baby pink dress and stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace along with the other royal family members, enjoying the military specter.  The Princess\u2019 life at Anmer Hall  For the last two years, Charlotte had stayed with her parents and brother at Anmer Hall, her parents\u2019 10-bedroom mansion in Norfolk, England. It was a simple life there with Kate managing the whole show alone. She had her royal servants and her children\u2019s nanny.  An insider told People:  \u201cThere was no formality at all. It really was like any other family sitting down to lunch, with George and Charlotte eating their homemade food in their high chairs and toddling around with their toys.\u201d  He added:  \u201cYou\u2019d think that Kate and William would have an army of staff to help them out, but it really was just them and the children,\u201d  Another family friend said:  \u201cThe children have good fun together. They are brilliant kids \u2014 very playful and cheerful.\u201d  The full bio of Princess Charlotte here  Share this",

Gossip Cop, however, can exclusively debunk this bogus story.  According to the National Enquirer, Harington recently purchased a home near Clooney\u2019s estate in England, and now Clooney is desperately trying to become friends with the TV star. A supposed \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine, \u201cGeorge has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire and Lake Como \u2013 but he\u2019s in for disappointment. Kit doesn\u2019t want to be his new pal.\u201d  The outlet\u2019s dubious insider goes on to say Harington is trying to avoid the Hollywood scene, adding, \u201cKit\u2019s mind is pretty made up. He doesn\u2019t want to be George\u2019s buddy, but George keeps begging him to come away on a motorbike tour. It\u2019s getting annoying!\u201d The seemingly phony source adds, \u201cKit\u2019s home is too far to take a boat, thank goodness \u2013 or else George would probably row by.\u201d  Of course, Clooney has a wife and newborn twins at home, so it seems very unlikely he\u2019s looking to spend his free time with a young actor he doesn\u2019t know. Regardless of how absurd the tabloid\u2019s story sounds, Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the situation, who laughed off the report before assuring us it\u2019s \u201cfalse.\u201d Unfortunately, the Enquirer has a habit of publishing phony reports about the movie star, so this latest piece of fiction comes as no surprise.  Gossip Cop recently called out the tabloid for making up a story about Clooney loving his wife Amal\u2019s \u201cpregnancy curves.\u201d We also busted the outlet after it concocted a tall tale about Clooney\u2019s baby boy peeing in his face during a diaper change. This latest article from the untrustworthy publication is similarly untrue.  Truth rating: 0",

About fifteen members of the Swedish royal court are expected to be present at the lunch, according to Kensington Palace.    Getty Images  Middleton dressed simply in a forest green turtleneck dress, black tights and pumps, but her stylish Swedish counterpart, Princess Victoria, went for something more lavish\u2014a pink dress covered in rose patterns with sheer sleeves and a pussy-bow neckline. The Queen wore a royal blue skirt suit, and the King and two Princes were also sharply dressed.  Like William and Kate, Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel are parents to two young children, five-year-old Princess Estelle and one-year-old Prince Oscar. (You might recall the family of four's adorably snowy Christmas card.) The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, however, are expecting another baby in April.

Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel actually attended the Duke and Duchess' wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.  Getty Images  William and Kate's visit to Stockholm's royal palace is part of their four-day royal tour of Sweden and Norway, which began today. The trip is part of their duties as unofficial Brexit ambassadors, as they attempt to strengthen relations with nearby European countries before Britain exits the EU.  Getty Images  After the luncheon, the Duke, Duchess, Princess and Prince took a walk together through Stockholm's cobblestone streets to the Nobel Museum.    The change in scenery called for change in wardrobe. Middleton donned a green coat with a black fur trim and matching hat, gloves, pants and black ankle booties. The Crown Princess wore opted for an army green double breasted coat, oxblood leather gloves and a plum clutch and booties to match her rosy dress underneath.

They just welcomed their little bundle of joy into the world last week and have shared the amazing news with the world. Both Cheryl and Liam couldn't stop gushing about this new little human in their lives and they are super proud to call themselves parents. However, the former X-Factor judge did reveal that their son doesn't have a moniker yet.  Some reports are stating that Liam and Cheryl could be disagreeing on a name which is why one hasn't been picked out yet. Of course, this is all speculation and no one really knows why the baby doesn't have a name yet except the close family.  But, we did some digging and actually found old interviews where Liam and Cheryl talk about what they would name their future child. These interviews were done separately and before they even started dating. But, they each had completely different ideas when it came to the name.  Could this be a clue as to what's going on with the naming today? While there's no clear answer, it's interesting to think about.  Cheryl told GQ magazine, \"I love kids, I'm obsessed with babies. I know that's what I was put on the earth to do \u2013 to be a mother\u2026Of course I've thought about baby names a million times. I like Alfie for a little boy.\"  However, Liam told Hits Radio, \"I like the name Taylor. Taylor's pretty neutral for a boy or a girl. That's what I'm going to call my first child if I had children.\"  Hmmm\u2026there's no telling when or if they will reveal the baby name when they have decided but we have a feeling they will come to an agreement. And we're so excited when they do. However, multiple outlets are reporting that this photo could be the last fans see of the child. Apparently, Liam and Cheryl turned down lots of offers to publicly debut their baby and have vowed to keep his privacy and protect him from the public eye.  While this seems like something they would do, we're hoping they share bits and pieces of the baby. To be honest, we can't go through life wondering if he looks more like Liam or more like Cheryl! One thing is for sure, he's healthy and that's all that really matters. Here's to hoping picking out a name isn't actually putting stress on Cheryl and Liam's relationship.  Love J-14?

RICHARD POHLE // Getty Images  Why?  Well, HELLO!'s royal correspondent Emily Nash explains: 'Prince George's time at school is private and although the Duke and Duchess shared an image from his first day at primary school last year, they won't do it every year.'  Royal tradition appears to dictate that children are pictured on their very first day of school, but aren't photographed in following years.  Handout // Getty Images  This would explain why we've only seen a handful of portraits on George on his first at Westacre Montessori in January 2016, and of Princess Charlotte attending her first day at Willcocks Nursery School in Kensington earlier this year.  Come to think of it, there are only a couple of snaps of Prince William and Prince Harry on their first days of a new school.  Tim Graham // Getty Images  The Express reports Prince George will return for the autumn school term on 6 September and will be expected to start ballet lessons this year.  Kate, Duchess of Cambridge is expected to drop off her son as she and husband Prince William regularly participate in the school run.  Meanwhile, Princess Charlotte will return to school on Wednesday 5 September, according to the nursery's term dates.  The three-year-old celebrated her first day at nursery in January, with Kensington Palace releasing a set of images of the student dressed in a red duffel coat and pink scarf on the steps of the school.  George and Charlotte are expected to make their next public appearance on Friday 12 October, when they attend Princess Eugenie's wedding in Windsor.

Even Cate Blanchett, who is known for her poise and confidence, admitted to feeling nervous before giving her speech. \"I'm so bad at this,\" she said, before taking the stage.\n\nThis is not the first time that Prince George has made headlines for his school life. Last year, he made his first day of school a memorable one by tightly holding his father's hand as they walked into the school gates. At the time, Kate Middleton was pregnant with their third child.\n\nRoyal tradition dictates that children are photographed on their very first day of school, but are not photographed in subsequent years. This is why we have only seen a handful of portraits of George on his first day at Westacre Montessori in January 2016, and of Princess Charlotte attending her first day at Willcocks Nursery School in Kensington earlier this year.\n\nPrince George is expected to return to Thomas's Academy in Battersea for the autumn school term on September 6, and will be expected to start ballet lessons this year. Kate Middleton is expected to drop off her son as she and husband Prince William regularly participate in the school run. Princess Charlotte will return to school on Wednesday, September 5, according to the nursery's term dates.\n\nGeorge and Charlotte are expected to make their next public appearance on October 12, when they attend Princess Eugenie's wedding in Windsor. It is yet to be confirmed whether they will act as a pageboy and bridesmaid, as they did for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's big day in May.",

The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Clooney has donned many hats in his life \u2014 actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  Advertisement  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, \u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever having kids.\u201d  But it was a long road to get there. \u201cI don\u2019t have that gene that people have to replicate,\u201d he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn\u2019t married with kids, he replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t had aspirations in that way, ever.\u201d And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? \u201cWhat do you do? Should I go, \u2018I got to get me some kids right now!\u2019 and rush out and impregnate someone?\u201d  Advertisement  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: \u201cWell, I\u2019m also not running for president, but I played that role in \u2018Ides of March.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t an actual lawyer when I did \u2018Michael Clayton,\u2019 and I don\u2019t fire people for a living like I did in \u2018Up in the Air.\u2019 \u201d  Share this article Share  \u201cI keep saying I\u2019ll never get married again or have children but people just don\u2019t want to believe me,\u201d Clooney told Britain\u2019s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Advertisement  Perhaps it\u2019s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  \u201cElla, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,\u201d the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. \u201cGeorge is sedated and should recover in a few days.\u201d",

It was written by Alexander Delgado Hern\u00e1ndez, Lopez, Jerickson Mendoza, Jimmy Abreu, Manuel Bolivar, Marc Anthony, Oscar \"Oscarcito\" Hern\u00e1ndez, Randy Malcom Mart\u00ednez Amey and \u00c1lvaro Farinas, while production was handled by Arbise \"Motiff\" Gonz\u00e1lez, Julio Reyes Copello, Anthony and Hern\u00e1ndez. The song was released digitally on July 4, 2017, by Nuyorican Productions and Sony Music Latin.  A dance and reggaeton song about \"when love takes you by surprise\", \"Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo\" was praised by critics, who described it as a potential summer hit. While failing to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, it charted moderately worldwide, reaching the top forty in countries such as Poland, Finland, Spain, Hungary, Switzerland and Venezuela. An accompanying music video for the single was directed by Emil Nava. It depicts Lopez falling in love with a photographer played by Khotan Fern\u00e1ndez, and features a cameo appearance by Anthony.  Background [ edit ]  In March 2016, it was confirmed by Billboard that Lopez had returned to Epic Records, having previously parted ways with the label in 2010. She signed a new long-term contract that saw her reunite with longtime mentor, L.A.

Her ex-husband Marc Anthony serves as executive producer for the album.[4][5] Anthony described the album as \"some of the best work I've ever done and some of the best work that she's ever done\", and of their collaboration said: \"The fact that she put her career in my hands is a massive responsibility, but no one knows her like I do ... We've always been good friends from day one, you know.\"[6] \"Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo\" serves as the album's first single.[7] The single's cover art features Lopez posing in front of a sea, clothed in a 1960s-inspired yellow gown custom designed by Michael Costello.[8] Katie Skinner of Billboard observed that the shot \"fits Lopez's glamorous style and personality perfectly.\"[9]  Composition [ edit ]  \"Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo\" was produced by Oscar Hernandez \"Oscarcito\", Jimmy \"JIMMIX\" Abreu, Manuel \"ManyBeat\" Bolivar and Motiff.[4] In English, the title translates to \"neither you nor I\".[8] The track sees Lopez and Gente de Zona \"pronounce their love for one another over a joyful production\",[10] which features a reggaeton beat and horn section.[11] Lopez commented that the song is \"really about when love takes you by surprise \u2014 'Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo,' 'Not You, Not Me' really expected this to happen, you know? That's what it's about, it's one of those things that when love comes, it just comes, it doesn't announce itself, and then it just takes over \u2014 ha! \u2014 you know what I mean? That's what the song is about, which is why I love it so much.\"[12] She revealed that the song mirrored her own relationship with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez.[12]  Critical response [ edit ]  Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos called the song a \"vivacious dance track\", noting that \"Lopez's vocals stand out over the song's intricate guitars and horns.\"[2] MTV UK labelled it a \"future smash hit\" and wrote: \"Here's hoping that 'Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo' follows the international success of other Spanish bangers like 'Bailando' and 'Despacito'.\"[13] Mike Nied from Idolator echoed this sentiment, remarking that the song \"may be a contender for the coveted title of Song Of The Summer\", calling it a \"potentially massive hit\".[10] Brooke Metz of USA Today said: \"The song, with its fast pace, swinging trumpets and all-Spanish lyrics, creates the perfect soundtrack for beach days and summer nights.\"[14]  Chart performance [ edit ]  \"Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo\" peaked at number 24 in Spain, and was certified Gold by Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a for sales of 20,000 units.[15] In the United States, it sold 4,867 copies after two days,[16] and later peaked at number 15 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[17]  Live performances [ edit ]  Lopez debuted \"Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo\" during her first concert in the Dominican Republic at the Altos de Chav\u00f3n amphitheater in April 2017. She was joined on-stage by Gente de Zona for the performance.[18][19] Lopez and Gente de Zona officially premiered the song during her performance at Macy's July 4 Fireworks Spectacular, which aired the same day. It took place before a live audience at Hunter's Point South. The song became available digitally immediately after the performance[14][20] which received positive feedback on social media, as well as criticism towards Lopez for \"performing a Spanish song in celebration of an American holiday\".[21] Lopez wore a high-cut, double-slit embroidered gown designed by Fausto Puglisi while performing \"Ni T\u00fa Ni Yo\",[10][22] which also drew criticism for its revealing nature.[21] She performed an acoustic version of the song at the Stars Together For One Voice: Somos Live! concert/telethon in October 2017, which benefited victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.[23]  Music video [ edit ]  The song's official music video premiered on Telemundo on July 11, 2017.[24] Lopez shared an image from the set of the video shoot on June 13, in which she and Gente de Zona are featured wearing Caribbean-styled outfits.[25] The music video was directed by Emil Nava, and was shot in Islamorada, Florida Keys over two days. It features several product placements and cameos from Anthony, Mexican actor Khotan Fern\u00e1ndez, and actor/Sprint \"Test Man\" Paul Marcarelli. Lopez's outfits in the music video include a red wrap dress and a canary yellow gown.[26] According to Billboard, set in Miami, the clip \"tells the story of Lopez falling in love with a photographer she met through her manager (played by ex-husband Marc Anthony), while also enjoying life in a tropical paradise.\"[27] The clip begins with a potential director pitching a tropical-themed idea for the song's music video to Lopez and Anthony. This is followed by Lopez \"flirtatiously\" posing for the photographer while donning a number of \"elaborate fashions\" and \"sultry poses\" on a beach, in front of a plain backdrop and amid tropical foliage.[28]  Charts [ edit ]  Certifications [ edit ]  Region Certification Certified units/sales Mexico (AMPROFON)[52] Gold 30,000\u2021 Spain (PROMUSICAE)[15] Gold 20,000\u2021 \u2021 Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.

        "doc_1_text": "Swedish pop group  This article is about a former Swedish band. It is not to be confused with Ateez , a South Korean boy band, or A-Teen , a South Korean internet drama series.  A-Teens (stylized as A\u2605TEENS or A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group[1] from Stockholm. The group was formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute group called ABBA-Teens which was later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Paul, Dhani Lennevald, and Sara Lumholdt. The group is best known for the singles \"Mamma Mia\" (1999) and \"Upside Down\" (2000), both of which were hits worldwide. The group was particularly successful in their home country where they amassed ten top 10 hit singles on the Swedish charts.  After six years together, the group disbanded following the release of their Greatest Hits album in May 2004.[2]  History [ edit ]  1998\u20132000: The ABBA Generation [ edit ]  The original logo that the band used for their first releases under the original name, ABBA-Teens  In 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit came together to form the ABBA-Teens and began recording their debut album which would consist entirely of covers of ABBA songs. Their first single, \"Mamma Mia\", was first released in April 1999 in their native Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. Following this release, the group's name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid litigation.[3][4] \"Mamma Mia\" was released internationally following their name change and topped the charts in over ten countries.[citation needed]  The official A-Teens logo  In August 1999, the group released their debut album The ABBA Generation, consisting entirely of ABBA covers reinterpreted with a modern pop and electronic sound. The album reached number one in Sweden and Argentina. In the United States, the album peaked at seventy-one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and was certified Gold.[5] The album sold more than 2 million copies worldwide and was certified Gold or Platinum in over 22 countries.[citation needed] Further singles from the album were hits in Sweden: \"Super Trouper\" peaked at number two and \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) peaked at number ten; both songs charted moderately worldwide. \"Happy New Year\" was released as a standalone single in Sweden at the end of 1999 and peaked at number four.  In March 2000, the group released the single \"Dancing Queen\". The single reached ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone, being certified Gold.[citation needed] Coinciding with this release, the band embarked on a promotional tour of the United States and was an opening act for the Britney Spears tour later that summer.[6] The group made several appearances on Disney and Nickelodeon. In September 2000, the A-Teens won a Viva Music Award for Best International Newcomer.[7]  2001: Teen Spirit [ edit ]  On 26 February 2001, the group released their second studio album Teen Spirit, which consists entirely of original tracks. It debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. The album peaked at number thirteen on the European Albums Chart.[8] In the United States, the album peaked at number fifty and was certified gold.[9][10]  The album was preceded by the single \"Upside Down\" in October 2000; this was their first single that was not an ABBA cover song.[11] It peaked at number two in Sweden and was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum.[12] The song reached the top ten in several countries. In the United States, the song was released with the alternate title \"Bouncing Off the Ceiling (Upside Down)\". The song peaked at 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the physical single peaked at number six on the Billboard Dance Single Sales component chart.[13][14] The single peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom, becoming their only top ten hit in the country.[15] Later singles from the album were hits in Sweden: \"Halfway Around the World\" peaked at number 7 and \"Sugar Rush\" peaked at number 15, however, these releases were not as successful worldwide.  The group promoted the album with a forty-three-date tour with Aaron Carter in the U.S.; the group later toured with No Angels in Germany.[6][16][17] The A-Teens also performed on the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour. The same year, Coca-Cola signed the group to become the face of the brand in Thailand.[18] By the end of 2001, Teen Spirit sold over 1 million copies worldwide.  In December 2001, the group released the Cathy Dennis-penned track \"Heartbreak Lullaby\". The song was recorded for the European soundtrack of the movie \"The Princess Diaries\". The single became another top ten hit for the band in their home country.[19]  2002\u20132003: Pop 'til You Drop! and New Arrival [ edit ]  In June 2002, the group released their third studio album Pop 'til You Drop!. The album was released exclusively in North America and Argentina.[20] The album debuted and peaked at number forty-five on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart.[21] The album was preceded by the single \"Can't Help Falling In Love\", a cover of the Elvis Presley song, in May 2002. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the Disney movie Lilo & Stitch.[22] In July 2002, \"Floorfiller\" was released as the second and final single from the album. In the summer of 2002, the group embarked on the Pop 'til You Drop! Tour, a thirty-date tour of the United States and Canada.[23][24] In November 2002, the group performed at the 2002 Swedish Hit Music Awards.[25]  In January 2003, the group released a reissue of Pop 'til You Drop! titled New Arrival exclusively in markets outside of North America.[26] The album contains seven tracks from Pop 'til You Drop! alongside six new tracks. The album debuted at number four in Sweden and was certified Gold a few weeks after its release.[27] Despite this, sales for New Arrival were lower than expected and the record sold fewer than 350,000 copies worldwide.[28] To promote the release, the band embarked on the New Arrival Tour that March, performing shows in Sweden, Denmark, Russia, and Slovakia.[29][30][31]  The album was preceded by the European release of \"Floorfiller\". The song served as the album's first single and became a top five hit in their home country.[32] The second single taken from the album was \"A Perfect Match\" which peaked at number two in Sweden.[33] \"Let Your Heart Do All the Talking\" was planned as the third single from New Arrival, but its commercial release was later canceled.[34] In May 2003, the group partnered with the brand Popdrinks for a promotional-only release of the song \"Bounce With Me\" in Sweden.[35]  2004: Greatest Hits and disbandment [ edit ]  In May 2004, the group released Greatest Hits, a compilation of three new songs and thirteen singles.[36] The album was preceded by the single \"I Promised Myself\", a cover of the Nick Kamen song.[37] The single became another top two hit for the group in Sweden.[38]  Following the release of Greatest Hits, the group disbanded; their disbandment was not publicly announced until April 2006.[39]  Discography [ edit ]  For a complete list of all the songs, see List of songs recorded by A-Teens  Tours [ edit ]  Pop 'Til You Drop!

It was released on 15 June 2017 through Columbia Records as the fourth single from his fifth studio album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 (2017), after \"Slide\", \"Heatstroke\" and \"Rollin\". Starrah assisted the artists in writing the song.[1][2]  \"Feels\" has reached number one in Belgium, Israel, Latvia, Lebanon, Poland and the United Kingdom, the top 10 in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Switzerland, and the top 20 in Italy, Sweden, and the United States.  Release [ edit ]  On 14 June 2017, Calvin Harris announced on social media that he would release the fourth single from Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 the next day, titled \"Feels\". The post included the single's cover art and credits.[3]  Composition [ edit ]  \"Feels\" is a disco-funk[4] and ska[5] song containing elements of dancehall, hip hop and electronica.[6] The bassline and chord progression of the song bear resemblance to \"Let's Groove\" (1981) by Earth, Wind and Fire; its authors, Maurice White and Wayne Vaughn, were later acknowledged in the song's credits.[7]  Critical reception [ edit ]  Andy Cush of Spin called the song \"a little flimsy\" while also noting that \"the groove is unimpeachable\" and that \"It has a skillful melange of sounds from the mid-70s apex of analog recording, the era of disco and yacht rock: a warm and rounded bassline, some Nile Rodgers-style guitar, a slick descending line on Fender Rhodes.\"[8] Rolling Stone's Elia Leight said that the song is \"a simple, lighthearted loop, which combines punctual ska guitar, a playful keyboard line and charming squeaks that recall a cartoon character's slip on a banana peel.\"[9] Brent Faulkner from The Musical Hype said the song is undercooked, leaving more to be desired, adding that it's \"the type of record that is pleasing more because of the sound than the lyricism.\"[10]  Chart performance [ edit ]  In the US, \"Feels\" debuted at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached a peak of 20, making it Harris' eighth top 20 hit, as well as Perry's eighteenth. It spent eighteen weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, the song peaked at number five, giving Perry her eighteenth top ten in the country. In the UK, \"Feels\" topped the Official Singles Chart, making it Harris' eighth, Williams' fourth, Perry's fifth, and Sean's first number one in the chart.  Music videos [ edit ]  The song's accompanying music video was uploaded to Harris' Vevo channel on YouTube on 26 June 2017. The clip was directed by Emil Nava.[11] In the video, Harris, Williams, Perry and Big Sean lounge around on a desert island.[12]  A second video, also directed by Nava, followed two months later, featuring all four artists as a band playing the track in front of a live audience and receiving applause for their performance.[13]  Track listings [ edit ]  Digital download[14] No. Title Length 1. \"Feels\" (featuring Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry & Big Sean) 3:43  Personnel [ edit ]  Credits adapted from the song's liner notes.[3][14]  Charts [ edit ]  Certifications [ edit ]  Release history [ edit ]  Release dates for \"Feels\" Region Date Format Label Ref.

Kelley has recorded for Hollywood Records, Threshold Records and DNK Records as a pop rock artist. His songs \"Amazing\" and \"Only You\" reached the top ten on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart.  In 2010, Kelley signed to MCA Nashville and began a country music career.[2] His debut country single, \"Georgia Clay\", reached the top 20 on the Hot Country Songs charts.  Kelley is married to actress and model Katherine Heigl.  Early life [ edit ]  Kelley was born in Augusta, Georgia[1] to Dr. John W. Kelley, a cardiologist, and Gayle Kelley.[3] Kelley began his musical career at the age of 11. His younger brother, Charles Kelley, is a musician and singer in the country trio Lady A.[4] When he was a teenager, Kelley and his brother Charles formed a band called Inside Blue.[citation needed] By the time he was 14, the band released a CD with five songs on it, which led to a meeting with James Brown.[citation needed] Kelley played the guitar in the high school jazz band alongside Charles (drums) and Dave Haywood (guitar) from Lady A.[citation needed]  Kelley attended the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, and is a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.[citation needed]  Music career [ edit ]  Kelley released his independent album, Changing Faces, in 2001 and signed with Hollywood Records in 2002. Working with John Alagia as his record producer, Kelley released the album, For the Ride Home, on June 3, 2003.  Even though Kelley has stated that the lyrics from his song \"Angeles\" were fabricated, he moved to Los Angeles from Georgia and recorded the majority of his second album, Almost Honest, in the studio of his home.[citation needed] Almost Honest was released on August 23, 2005, and featured the hit single, \"Only You.\"[citation needed]  After asking to be released from his contract with Hollywood Records, Kelley released his third album, Just Say The Word under his own label, Threshold.[citation needed] The digital version of the album was released through iTunes on June 6, 2006, while the physical album was released in stores in the United States on July 25, 2006.[citation needed] \"The Pop Game\" was the first single from his self-produced album and was accompanied by a cartoon video.[citation needed]  Kelley's next album, Special Company, was released in the United States on January 14, 2008.[citation needed] His label, Threshold, was renamed DNK Records so as to avoid confusion with another record label by the same name. Kelley also released a digital album that summer titled Backwoods on July 7.[citation needed] On September 23 of that year, Kelley released the album To Remember exclusively through Target stores.[citation needed] The title track was also included on the AT&T Team USA Soundtrack.[citation needed]  Kelley is a supporter of file sharing applications for independent artists who have a difficult time receiving an audience. In fact, Kelley was \"found\" after targeting Eric Clinger at Hollywood Records with private spam, \"If you like James Taylor, Try Josh Kelley,\" messages using the Napster program.  In November 2009, Kelley signed with MCA Nashville and began recording his first country album in 2010.[5] The album's first single, \"Georgia Clay\", was released to country radio in August 2010. The single became a Top 20 hit on the Hot Country Songs chart.[citation needed] The album, also entitled Georgia Clay, was released in March 2011.[citation needed]  Kelley released the album New Lane Road in 2016.[6]  Concert tours [ edit ]  Supporting  Revolution Tour with Miranda Lambert (2011)  with Miranda Lambert (2011) Own the Night Tour with Lady A (2011)  with Lady A (2011) The Driver Tour with Charles Kelley (2016)  Personal life [ edit ]  Kelley met actress Katherine Heigl in spring 2005 when she appeared in his music video \"Only You\". One year later, in June 2006, they became engaged.[7] He wrote the song \"Hey Katie\" for Heigl. The Heigl-Kelley wedding took place on December 23, 2007, at the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Park City, Utah. Heigl's Grey's Anatomy co-stars T.R. Knight, Sandra Oh, Ellen Pompeo and Justin Chambers attended the ceremony, as well as Grey's Anatomy spinoff series Private Practice star Kate Walsh. The ceremony was officiated by Unitarian minister Tom Goldsmith. Heigl walked down the aisle to an acoustic song written by Kelley and performed by a cello and guitar players. The couple wrote their own vows.[citation needed]  During a taping of Live With Regis and Kelly, Heigl stated that she and Kelley chose not to live together before they were married, saying, \"I think I just wanted to save something for the actual marriage... I wanted there to be something to make the actual marriage different than the dating or the courtship.\"[8]  In 2009, the couple adopted a South Korean baby girl,[9] naming her Nancy Leigh, after Heigl's mother and her adopted, Korean-born older sister, respectively. Nancy Leigh's nickname is Naleigh.[10] Nancy Leigh was born with a congenital heart defect that was repaired with open heart surgery before she left South Korea.[11] Kelley and Heigl adopted a second daughter, Adalaide Marie Hope, in April 2012.[12][13]  In addition to their two daughters, Josh Kelley and Katherine Heigl have a son, Joshua Bishop Kelley Jr., born December 20, 2016.[14]  Kelley, Heigl, and their children live in Oakley, Utah.[15]  Discography [ edit ]  Studio albums [ edit ]  Extended plays [ edit ]  Title EP details Josh Kelley Live Session EP Release date: August 2, 2005  Label: Hollywood Georgia Clay Release date: November 30, 2010  Label: MCA Nashville  Singles [ edit ]  Guest singles [ edit ]  Year Single Artist Album 2017 \"Young Americans\" Colt Ford (with Charles Kelley) Love Hope Faith  Other contributions [ edit ]  Music videos [ edit ]",

        "doc_2_text": "All NFL Super Bowl halftime shows throughout the decades  Halftime shows are a tradition during American football games at all levels of competition. Entertainment during the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), represents a fundamental link to pop culture, which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest.  Prior to the early 1990s, the halftime show featured university marching bands (the Grambling State University Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to 1990), drill teams, and other performance ensembles such as Up with People. In the 90s, the halftime show began to feature major hit musicians, beginning with Super Bowl XXV (1991) with New Kids on the Block. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, Super Bowl XXVII (1993) featured a headlining performance by Michael Jackson.  Background [ edit ]  View of the halftime show at Super Bowl I  During most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college marching band. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring drill teams and other performance ensembles; the group Up with People produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to counterprogram the game,[1] saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block, Gloria Estefan, Michael Jackson, Clint Black, Patti LaBelle, and Tony Bennett. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme\u2014begun with Super Bowl III\u2014ended, replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts in an alleged \"wardrobe malfunction\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These shows were considered \"family friendly\" and the time in which they took place has been described as \"the age of reactionary halftime shows\".[2] Since Super Bowl XLV, the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.  The NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends.[3] Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation.[4][5][6] According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure.[7] For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the Journal, received a \"chilly\" response from those involved.[8][9]  History [ edit ]  The following is a list of the performers, producers, themes, and sponsors for each Super Bowl game's show. This list does not include national anthem performers, which are listed in the article List of national anthem performers at the Super Bowl. Names in bold are headline performers.  1960s [ edit ]  1970s [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  1990s [ edit ]  2000s [ edit ]  2010s [ edit ]  2020s [ edit ]  Details on specific shows [ edit ]  Super Bowl XL [ edit ]  For the Rolling Stones, the stage was in the form of the group's iconic tongue logo (John Pasche's design first used in 1971 on their Sticky Fingers album). It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: \"Start Me Up\", \"Rough Justice\", and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined.[64] In the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, ABC and the NFL imposed a five-second delay and censored lyrics considered too sexually explicit in the first two songs by briefly turning off Mick Jagger's microphone\u2014censoring to which the group had previously agreed.[65] However, the choice of the Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the traditional Detroit \"Motown Sound\", and no artists from the area were included.[66]  Achievements [ edit ]  See also [ edit ]",

The song was released as the fifth single to anticipate Shakira's eleventh studio album El Dorado on 7 April 2017, by Sony Music Latin. Its lyrics were written by Shakira. Its musical composition was done by Shakira and Rayito, who also produced the song along the co-production of The Rudeboyz and A.C.[2][3][4][5][6]  Background and release [ edit ]  She teased the song hours prior its release sending personalized postcards to a few fans, where she appears climbing a tree.

(Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times)  Following news this week that the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival had booked Radiohead, Kendrick Lamar and Beyonc\u00e9 to lead its 2017 lineup, the owner of the company that oversees the festival\u2019s organizers has come under fire for his political interests.  According to a widely picked-up report in Uproxx, Philip F. Anschutz, the owner of AEG, whose AEG Live division is the world\u2019s second largest presenter of live music, sports and entertainment after Live Nation, has donated to a number of anti-LGBTQ groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, National Christian Foundation and Family Research Council.  A number of these organizations have been listed as \u201cextremist groups\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Because AEG Live oversees Coachella promoter Goldenvoice, people have taken to social media to question if anyone should drop hundreds of dollars for the destination festival out of fear that their money would fund anti-gay groups.

The song tells the story of when she fell in love with her former partner Gerard Piqu\u00e9, whom she met in 2010 on the set of the music video for \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),\" the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The song was released by Sony Music Latin and its lyrics were written by Shakira. Its musical composition was done by Shakira and Rayito, who also produced the song along with the co-production of The Rudeboyz and A.C.\n\nThe music video for the song was shot in Barcelona and was released on 12 May 2017. The song garnered media attention due to the appearance of her former partner Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and became her twenty-first Vevo Certified video (collaborations included). In France, \"Me Enamor\u00e9\" debuted at number 72 on 14 April 2017, reaching number 41 after the release of its music video and eventually peaking at number 13 after the release of El Dorado. In the United States, the song debuted at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100, where later peaked at number 83, and at number 11 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, where it reached number five following the release of the music video and peaked at number four after the release of the album.\n\n\"Me Enamor\u00e9\" peaked at number three in Spain and has been certified three times Platinum for exceeding sales of 120,000 copies in the country. Shakira performed live \"Me Enamor\u00e9\" for the first time at Univision's Upfront on 16 May 2017. Then, she performed the song ten days later at her El Dorado Album Release Party at The Temple House in Miami on 26 May 2017. She also performed the song at the El Dorado Album Launch in Barcelona on 8 June 2017. She performed the song on the sixth season finale of The Voice: la plus belle voix in June 2017 in Paris.

        "doc_1_text": "Associated Press  MADRID \u2013 Pop music star Shakira is under investigation in Spain for possible tax evasion during the three years before she officially moved to Barcelona, Spanish authorities said Tuesday.  Shakira switched residences in 2015 from the Bahamas to Barcelona, where she lives with her partner, Barca soccer player Gerard Piqu\u00e9, and the couple\u2019s two sons.  Spanish tax authorities suspect the Colombian singer already lived in the northeast city between 2012 and 2014, when she allegedly failed to pay income taxes in Spain.  Prosecutor Jose Miguel Company said the tax authorities referred the probe to the Barcelona prosecutor\u2019s office in December. He said a decision on whether to press charges or not is expected by mid-June.  Anna Forastier, a spokeswoman for auditing firm PwC, said the company has been hired by Shakira for the investigation. Forastier declined to disclose any details.  Shakira was named in the \u201cParadise Papers\u201d leaks that detailed the offshore tax arrangements of numerous high-profile individuals, including musical celebrities like Madonna and U2\u2019s Bono.  The documents obtained by German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and investigated by Spanish news website El Confidencial showed that in 2009 Shakira had relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta, the tiny European Union nation that has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.  Shakira and Piqu\u00e9\u2019s relationship dates back to 2011, when Shakira started frequenting Barcelona. El Confidencial, citing papers it obtained from offshore services providers, reported that she listed the Bahamas as her official residence until 2015.  \u201cIt\u2019s public knowledge that this is not the case,\u201d Company told The Associated Press.  If the probe finds wrongdoing, Shakira would join a list of celebrities that have been in trouble with Spanish tax authorities, including footballers Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.  In November, Shakira canceled the first concerts to promote her 11th album, El Dorado, for what she said were medical reasons. The tour is scheduled to begin in June in Germany and then stop in nine more European countries before moving to the United States.",

The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple\u2019s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend \u2013 who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale \u2013 while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet \u201cGo Ahead And Break My Heart\u201d as they both stopped by Shelton\u2019s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting \u201cGwen! Gwen! Gwen!\u201d as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That\u2019s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all \u201clucky\u201d to have her perform because she\u2019d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  \u201cYou guys are very lucky that [she\u2019s here],\u201d Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  \u201cShe actually gave birth to twins yesterday,\u201d the country star then joked of how they\u2019re hounded by pregnancy rumors, \u201cand she\u2019s here tonight to sing with me.\u201d  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC\u2019s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 likely due to Shelton\u2019s busy touring schedule \u2013 Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen \u2013 who\u2019s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo \u2013 shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine\u2019s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.

The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple\u2019s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend \u2013 who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale \u2013 while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet \u201cGo Ahead And Break My Heart\u201d as they both stopped by Shelton\u2019s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting \u201cGwen! Gwen! Gwen!\u201d as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That\u2019s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all \u201clucky\u201d to have her perform because she\u2019d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  \u201cYou guys are very lucky that [she\u2019s here],\u201d Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  \u201cShe actually gave birth to twins yesterday,\u201d the country star then joked of how they\u2019re hounded by pregnancy rumors, \u201cand she\u2019s here tonight to sing with me.\u201d  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC\u2019s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 likely due to Shelton\u2019s busy touring schedule \u2013 Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen \u2013 who\u2019s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo \u2013 shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine\u2019s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.

There were 500 girls that tried out!\u2019 and I\u2019ll send him videos.\u201d  Stefani, who was recently spotted spending a sweet family Mother\u2019s Day with Shelton and her three kids at church, also revealed in the new interview that fans hoping for new music probably shouldn\u2019t keep their hopes up, as she said that she knows she\u2019s nearing the end of her music career that first began way back in 1986 as a member of the band No Doubt.  \u201cI\u2019m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician\u2026 because of my age, and I\u2019ve been doing it for thirty-something years,\u201d she said, suggesting that she may soon be ready to retire from music.

She called her divorce from the rocker an \u201cunexpected life crisis\u201d after 14 years of marriage.  \u201cI did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,\u201d she said of her split with the musician, but noted that touring all the time just isn\u2019t \u201crealistic\u201d for her as a mom. \u201cIt was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids.\u201d  As reported by Daily Mail, Stefani announced her Las Vegas residency during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April.

I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favorite,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs.

And even if Shelton is not this year\u2019s pick, Stefani said: \u201cI still score.\u201d  The couple has been hot and heavy since they began dating in November 2015 when they met as coaches on The Voice, not long after Shelton\u2019s divorce from fellow country crooner Miranda Lambert and Stefani\u2019s divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale.  And they\u2019ve been inseparable ever since.  From red carpet appearances and on-stage performances to their undying support of one another from a distance and their sweet selfies, the pair are a match made in heaven \u2014 blending their families together, sharing holidays, and even collaborating on songs including \u201cGo Ahead and Break My Heart\u201d (off of Shelton\u2019s album, If I\u2019m Honest), and \u201cYou Make It Feel Like Christmas\u201d (the title track of Stefani\u2019s Christmas album).  Even Shelton\u2019s longtime Voice costar Adam Levine previously said during a Howard Stern Show interview: \u201cThey\u2019re so in love it\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s so funny. They found each other at really interesting times in their lives. It\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d",

Wow, I'm gonna look really good huh?

They have been spotted on red carpets, performing on stage together, and collaborating on songs, including \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" from Shelton's album, If I'm Honest, and \"You Make It Feel Like Christmas\" from Stefani's Christmas album.\n\nMeanwhile, Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up after more than two years together. Lambert may have hinted at the split on stage to her fans during a concert in Knoxville in March, when she talked about how she channels heartbreak into her music. East also opened up about the struggles of dating as a touring musician.\n\nFans noticed that the two had not talked about their relationship or posted about each other on social media lately. Representatives for Lambert and East did not respond to People's request for comment on the split. However, a source told Us Weekly that there might still be hope for the two, saying, \"They have spent a lot of time apart, but potentially could end up back together. The love is still there.\"",

According to Ticketmaster, there are over 1,300 seats available for the December 30th concert, which is her worst night of sales.  Since there are still so many seats available for multiple shows, discount sites like GoodSeatTickets.com have slashed prices up to 75 percent.

He wrote that Stefani had performed three Las Vegas shows so far, and he has been to all three. Then he added the hashtag #stalker.  The 48-year-old Hollaback Girl singer seems to be okay with her boyfriend\u2019s stalker behavior, and just last week she shared photos of the two sharing a kiss on the lips.  Shelton walked the red carpet with Stefani on the opening night of her show on June 27th, and the crowd that night gave him a standing ovation when he walked into the theater.

There was no way Gwen Stefani\u2018s 49th birthday party was going to happen without boyfriend Blake Shelton being right there by her side. The 42-year-old country crooner was there at the Halloween-themed bash on Oct. 3 along with her three sons and some family and friends. Instagram-loving Gwen shared pics from the whole event in her stories, but the best was a photo where she leaned over to plant a big smooch on her boyfriend of nearly three years. Even though she managed to cut the top of his head off in the selfie, we can see from his sparkling eyes and big smile that he\u2019s loving every minute of the \u201cSweet Escape\u201d singer\u2019s affection.  Gwen couldn\u2019t get super romantic with her man because her four-year-old son Apollo was seated in his lap. The little one\u2019s legs can be seen wearing blue sweatpants with big silver stars on them. Blake\u2019s wearing a black high collared shirt for the occasion, which is a big step up in dressing for him. No flannel shirts for Gwen\u2019s big day! The beautiful blonde is leaning over, holding his neck from behind with one of her hands while pulling him in for the sweet kiss.  Before the party began, Gwen showed off on her IG stories pics from inside the bash. A pumpkin was carved with the letters of her name glowing through the candlelight. Fake spider webs were placed through the lighting in her home with spooky little qhosts attached. It looked like she hoped things could be outdoors by the pool at her Beverly Hills mansion, but a pic showed the dark and ominous clouds overhead, which actually made the theme of her party more fun. A bright, sunny LA day wouldn\u2019t have helped the spooky affect. And yes, it did rain by early evening.  Gwen\u2019s a festive lady so even her cake was bright and colorful. It featured light green frosting, candy confetti and \u201cHappy Birthday Gwen\u201d in pink icing. Earlier in the day Blake gave her the hottest public birthday wish by posting a super sexy pic of Gwen flaunting toned stomach while wearing a bra and short-shorts. \u201cSomehow it feels more like MY birthday everyday,\u201d Blake wrote. \u201cHappy Birthday @gwenstefani!!!!

Gwen and Blake often express their admiration for each other in public interviews and Blake truly seems to love spending time with Gwen\u2019s boys as if they were his own.

Although Blake doesn\u2019t have any children of his own, his family outings with Gwen and her boys prove he\u2019d be the best dad ever.

But if you love love? The dozens of photos, videos, onstage moments and ugga muggas they shared are a reminder of what it can be like to catch lightning in a bottle.  This timeline of Lambert and East's romance starts with a broken heart and might end with one, too, if you believe everything you read at the grocery store. The pile of sources confirming their breakup grows taller and taller, but neither singer has spoken up (they have stopped following each other on Instagram, and though Lambert still follows East on Twitter, he does not reciprocate). Quietly they loved on, until they didn't.  July 20, 2015 \u2014 Shock and heartbreak. Lambert and husband Blake Shelton get divorced, ending country music's highest-profile marriage after just four years.  Sept. 12, 2015 \u2014 Exactly when Lambert started dating East wasn't clear until she shared this photo two years into the relationship, celebrating Sept. 12 as an anniversary. That's 54 days after her divorce from Shelton. She references the song \"Pushin' Time,\" a song she would later confirm she wrote about East.  During a taping for PBS' Front and Center Lambert would later reveal that the song was actually inspired by an early argument. \"It was all lovey-dovey and then we got in a fight, \u2019cause that\u2019s how it goes,\" she says. \"And I was pissed, \u2019cause that\u2019s also how it goes. He tried to smooth it over with me. I said, \u2018Are you going to break up with me?\u2019 He said, \u2018I think I\u2019ll wait 60 years.\u2019 So, sweet.\"  Jan. 1, 2016 \u2014 After weeks of speculation, the couple go public with a New Year's Day photo of them cuddling together on a couch and the caption: \"The snuggle is real.\"  Feb. 14, 2016 \u2014 During their two years together (and some change), one half of this couple would often storm the other's stage to sing a song or two. This Valentine's Day performance of \"Always Be My Baby\" (yes, the Mariah Carey hit) is the first documented time it happened. A Taste of Country News video also recalls how deep in it the country singer was. She wore a University of Alabama hat for him, which is saying something for a Texas girl!  April 2, 2016 \u2014 At the ACM Awards Lambert and East walk the red carpet for the very first time together. Her dress remains our favorite of her many glam looks. As for East, he'd only get one more shot on awards show carpet. In total, they hit six red carpets together.  July 17, 2016 \u2014 Lambert shares a photo of the couple kissing on Instagram with a caption that reads, \"Happy Birthday to my favorite 'Bama' boy!\" Photos of the two together were not rare by this point. East would also regularly Insta-flirt with his girlfriend of 10 months.  Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 2016 \u2014 The couple walk the BMI Awards and CMA Awards red carpet together and looked great. \"I was the big winner last night,\" East would later say on Instagram.  A few days later, Lambert responded to trolls who criticized her appearance with a sharply-worded post on Instagram that quoted Maya Angelou: \"Cowardly people hiding behind a keyboard or a cell phone writing their useless comments about our eyes and clothes and body language. What a bunch of bull s--t.\"  March 12, 2017 \u2014 Still dueting, still happy! East joins Lambert onstage during a Highway Vagabond Tour stop in Bossier, City, La., singing the Faces' \"Stay With Me.\" The song is unabashedly sexual, and Lambert and East definitely play on that in their performance, turning in a flirtatious, touchy-feely performance that lets their real-life chemistry shine through.  April 1, 2017 \u2014 After the ACM Awards in Las Vegas, the pair share Instagram messages in reference to Lambert's Female Vocalist of the Year win. \"Couldn't be more proud of this little lady and the amazing art she brings with her,\" East says on Instagram. Lambert follows with this:  July 16, 2017 \u2014 One day before East's 30th birthday, Lambert grabs his microphone in New York and delivers a slow, sultry version of \"Happy Birthday.\" The crowd joins in, and it's magical:  June 6-7, 2017 \u2014 Lambert and East make two appearances together at the 2017 CMA Music Festival, including her MuttNation March and the CMT Awards. Lambert then flies solo to the 2017 Taste of Country Music Festival.  Public appearances together slow after this. In fact, we found only one more.  Nov. 8, 2017 \u2014 At the 2017 CMAs, Lambert sparkles like a princess next to East in his usual black and white ensemble. The walk united and speak united after Garth Brooks lip syncs during his performance. First East blasted the Entertainer of the Year on Instagram, and she responded in the comments:  Anderson-East-Tweet (1) Instagram loading...  January 12, 2018 \u2014 Lambert shares what seems to be the last public photo of the couple together, though she continues to like his photos on social media through February 18. They no longer follow each other on Instagram.  March 3, 2018 \u2014 Tabloids started reporting a breakup in February, but it was Lambert's comments during a March show in Knoxville, Tenn., that truly stir the pot.  \"I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes,\" she said, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. \"That's my favorite. And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one.\"  Lambert's representatives did not respond to Taste of Country's request for comment at the time, and East's rep refused to talk about his personal life.

Before he was ejected from the theater, the man succeeded in kneeing one of the guards.

After allegedly being asked to leave, Webb leapt to the stage.

        "doc_1_text": "The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is not only a great time to catch celebrities who typically stick to sunny Los Angeles sporting winter coats for the first time since New Year's Eve, but the musical performances can sometimes offer nostalgia alongside holiday cheer. This year, 98 Degrees performed a new song on the Macy's Parade and rightfully, Twitter was freaking out. It's just the kind of '90s moment we need right now.  Well, that's not all that Twitter was reacting to during the performance. Al Roker introduced the group as an \"ageless boy band\" \u2014 which resulted in some friendly ridicule. The four middle-aged men still performing with 98 Degrees aren't exactly immortal, but they still look good and the song sounded great. Their new Christmas single is called \"Season of Love,\" not to be confused with \"Seasons of Love\" from the musical Rent and every high school theatre cast party you've ever attended. It's off the new 98 Degrees Holiday album Let It Snow that is available now and also includes classics like \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\" \"Silent Night,\" and \"What Child Is This.\"  They performed atop the Hallmark \"Countdown to Christmas\" advent calendar float too, which was not only a fun number connection, but kind of put the wholesome cherry on this heartwarming cake. What is Christmas if not for fond memories of boy bands and '90s bliss? Combined with appearances by the Goo Goo Dolls and Gwen Stefani, the parade this year was truly a Thanksgiving throwback to remember. Here's what folks had to say online.  All I want for Christmas is to turn back time.  \"Man Band,\" that's better.  OK, no need to get too cynical. It's Thanksgiving, after all.  Actually, Andy Mientus from Smash, Drew Lachey played Mark in 2005. Close!  Get out of here, bad joke.  You learn something new every day.  Love how nobody can agree on exactly what year we're throwing it back to with this \u2014 maybe the group really is ageless.  See? Next thing you now, somebody will be calling this an '80s flashback.  OK calm down.  Isn't that depressing? Kids these days don't even know.  Be honest \u2014 you watch Hallmark movies to see how your favorite '90s stars are doing too, don't you? This whole performance is kind of a mood.  They also performed \"Because Of You\" on Good Morning America if you want an additional dose of 1998. The reunion of the boy band, or \"man band \"or whatever you want to call it on the NBC broadcast hopefully started your holiday off with some much-needed reminiscing. Maybe you needed to remind your parents \"which one\" they were, if they ever cared to begin with \u2014 but it's important, OK?  If you're anxious for more, the group is going on a holiday tour with this new album. In an interview with Billboard, Nick Lachey said the album was inspired by touring with Ryan Cabrera. \"Ryan would literally be in his dressing room playing Christmas music, all summer long,\" he said. \" [We were] like, 'What's wrong with you?' He's like, 'It just makes you feel good, man!'\" It's different from the group's first Christmas album, actually, because of the years that have passed. They have families now.  \"Everybody kind of understands that Christmas is about spending time with your family and appreciating what you have, \" said Drew Lachey in the same interview. \"So for that to be part of our family and our musical legacy, it\u2019s definitely very special.\"  At least NBC didn't call 98 Degrees \"classic rock\" like they did with Goo Goo Dolls, causing every '90s kid out there to start arranging their funeral plot. Nostalgia should be fun, not remind you that life is fleeting and we're all basically ancient now. 98 Degrees and \"Season of Love\" deliver all the right feels.",

Shelton has often found himself confronting untrue reports about his relationship with Gwen Stefani ever since the two got together a few years ago. Almost on a constant basis, one can find false reports claiming that Blake and Gwen are getting married, or that they have already split up. Initially, Shelton found these reports so infuriating that they would get \u201cunder his skin,\u201d making him feel angry about how the media was exploiting their relationship for their interests.

Later, the same magazine wrongly claimed that Gwen Stefani was pregnant with Shelton\u2019s child \u2014 a story which was debunked by other news sites. Such false reports about the couple led Shelton to tweet out to his fans, asking them not to believe everything that they read about the pair in the media.  \u201c99 percent of the things you read about [me] on social media or the internet isn\u2019t true.

Blake, like most people, doesn\u2019t like a bad kisser.

He loves the way Gwen kisses him, it seals the deal!\u201d a Blake insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  The feeling appears to be mutual as Gwen adores how her man plants smooches on her, which he does constantly. She loves showing off on her social media all of the selfies of the Blakester giving her romantic and cuddly kisses on the cheek. The \u201cUsed to Love You\u201d singer even revealed on Aug. 27 that her lap top\u2019s screen saver is a pic of her beau planting a touching kiss on her right cheek while she absolutely beams at the camera. It came when she was showing off how she was DM\u2019ing someone about voting for pal Julia Michaels, 23, as Best New Artist at the VMAs, but the conversation was in a short window as to show off that the rest of the screen belonged to a sweet pic of the couple\u2019s love.

The country group premiered the trailer for \"Babe,\" their collaboration with Swift, during the 2018 CMT Awards on Wednesday. In the video, the Reputation songstress joins Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, along with Legends of Tomorrow star Brandon Routh in a retro drama that features Swift as a fiery redhead, who seems to be the other woman in Nettles and Routh's marriage.

The country singer is close pals with both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton, who announced their divorce last July. Since then, Shelton has moved on with No Doubt rocker Gwen Stefani, while Lambert has been cozying up to R&B singer Anderson East. But according to Monroe, all is good in her friends circle.    WATCH: Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Get Romantic at Pre-GRAMMYs Gala  ET chatted with the 29-year-old on the red carpet at the 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards in Los Angeles on Monday, where she couldn't stop gushing over Shelton's new girlfriend.  \"I don't know if Blake's going to be here tonight,\" she revealed, adding, \"but if I see Gwen I'm gonna high-five her, because she's awesome.\"  \"I met her when I sang with Blake at The Voice a long time ago, and I'll never forget, she said my voice was 'dope!'\" Monroe recalled. \"And I was like, 'Yeah! That's awesome.'\"  Monroe also told ET she's rooting for Shelton and Stefani to have a lifetime of love.  \"I think that any time you feel that in your heart, then you're a good match, you know,\" she explained. \"You can find someone just like you and it not work. Find someone opposite and it does, and I like that about love.\"  We couldn't agree more!

Even though the country-bluegrass duo, who go by Joey + Rory, didn't take home the gramophone (it went to Little Big Town), like Shelton, Monroe was hoping they would.  \"I wholeheartedly agree [with Blake],\" she said. \"Not only is it beautiful to watch how their story has unfolded and see where they're at right now, I would want nothing more than for them to win that.

ET spoke with the country superstars backstage at Rabobank Arena in Bakersfield, California, during their Soul2Soul World Tour on Saturday, just days ahead of their 21st wedding anniversary. The two tied the knot on Oct. 6, 1996, after meeting earlier that year when Hill opened up for McGraw during his Spontaneous Combustion Tour.  According to Hill, no anniversary gift is needed from her handsome husband.  \"He's good. He doesn't need to get me anything,\" Hill told ET's Keltie Knight. \"Honestly, do you, baby? He's good at giving gifts and making surprises.\"  Hill joked that as long as she doesn't have to exercise with her famously fit husband, it's all good.  \"That's the best gift ever,\" Hill cracked. \"That's amazing. I get to do that four-hour workout with you? No, thank you. That's my gift -- I don't have to do that workout with you.\"  On a more serious note, McGraw gushed about getting to see his wife perform every night, admitting he's still in awe of her.  \"For me, it's hearing her sing every night -- that's the best part about [the tour],\" McGraw said. \"Because she's not out there singing much... To see her up on stage, having a great time and just belting it out? I mean, I always say it: when I'm on stage with her, it's like NASCAR trying to keep up with an Indy car. She's just that good. So, to watch her sing and see what she does is pretty inspiring.\"  \"My hot wife, man,\" he sweetly added.  Even so, the two also have a sense of humor about enjoying their private time.  \"I'm going to go on a man vacation after this is over,\" McGraw said, responding to Dolly Parton's advice that the secret to her long marriage is not spending too much time together.  \"I need a girl vacation, actually,\" Hill added. \"I am surrounded by girls, but I love that. We have a great time in my dressing room.\"  Of course, McGraw said he stays clear of that area of the tour!  \"Yeah, I try to stay out of that dressing room,\" he noted. \"It's all girls in that dressing room.\"  Hill and McGraw are releasing their highly anticipated first joint album in November. For fans who can't get enough of the couple's tour, Showtime is airing behind-the-scenes footage of their tour as well as concert performances, premiering Nov. 17.  Clearly, the couple is more in love than ever after more than two decades of marriage and raising three daughters together -- 20-year-old Gracie, 19-year-old Maggie and 15-year-old Audrey. Earlier this month, McGraw wished his wife a happy fiftieth birthday with a romantic Instagram message.  \"Happy birthday to the most beautiful girl in the world,\" McGraw wrote. \"You are the most remarkable person that has ever been in my life.... Our daughters could not have a better role model. I am truly in love with you more everyday. Can't wait to see what 'the rest of our life' has in store for us.\"  Watch the video below to see their cutest moments throughout the years.",

The latest news over social media is Janet Jackson Inspiring Gwen Stefani to have another baby!  But is the news really true or is it just another wrong information?  Let\u2019s Find out!  Janet Jackson\u2019s inspiration for the new Baby for Gwen Stefani  Recently Janet Jackson has shown the world that having a baby later in life is possible, and her experience has served as hope to many people. Among those feeling inspired is Gwen Stefani.  HollywoodLife.com reported recently that the 47-year-old singer is considering becoming a mother again after knowing that Janet gave birth at 50 years old.  Though her three sons, Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3, do keep her plenty busy, the star would love to make her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, a dad.  The inside source said:  \u201cGwen would love to have another child with Blake. He\u2019s not pressuring her at all, but she knows it\u2019s something he would love too.\u201d  The source continued:  \u201cShe isn\u2019t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility. It\u2019s made her start to see it as something she and Blake really could make happen.\u201d  But the story is not true.  You may like to read Gavin Rossdale happy but also concerned that his children with his ex-wife Gwen Stefani are more time with her boyfriend Blake Shelton!  The truth of the Story  According to Gossip Cop, the news is just a rumor and is a False Report. Also about Hollywoodlife, Gossip Cop has found the truth and here it is.  HollywoodLife, which has been caught on numerous occasions for concocting untrue articles, is at it again. This time around the often discredited site stated that Jackson, as a \u201clate-in-life mom, has \u201cinspired\u201d Stefani to have one more child with Shelton.  The webloid first regurgitates such readily available information as Jackson was 50 when she gave birth to her baby boy Eissa, and that Stefani is currently 47 years old.  It then follows that up with a seemingly made-up quote that alleges that Stefani  \u201cisn\u2019t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility.\u201d  Well, this is \u201cmore than a possibility\u201d: The site either relied on yet another unreliable \u201cinsider\u201d or simply made up this fake news story on its own.  Just a few days ago, the webloid alleged that Stefani and Shelton fight constantly over him wanting alone time. It was a big lie and was busted by Gossip Cop.  As Gossip Cop accurately reported, Stefani and Shelton did not split up.  With a number of equally untrustworthy sites that picked up its fabricated claim, Gossip Cop can stop this fake news story in its tracks.  Whether she one day decides and is able to have a fourth child, it will have nothing to do with Jackson.

According to HollywoodLife.com, seeing Janet Jackson, who had a healthy baby at 50, has inspired Stefani to open her mind more to the possibility of having another child. However, Gossip Cop has found that the news is just a rumor and is a false report. HollywoodLife, which has been caught on numerous occasions for concocting untrue articles, has once again stated that Jackson, as a \u201clate-in-life mom, has \u201cinspired\u201d Stefani to have one more child with Shelton. However, the site either relied on yet another unreliable \u201cinsider\u201d or simply made up this fake news story on its own. It is important to note that whether Stefani decides and is able to have a fourth child, it will have nothing to do with Jackson.

But back to Halsey and G-Eazy! The pair announced their split several weeks ago, and since then fans have been speculating that G-Eazy cheated on his ex. Mostly because Halsey tweeted 1) A scissors emoji which is a possible reference to G-Eazy's lyrics, \"Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my d*ck off,\" and 2) the words \"pumpkin eater,\" which is a possible reference to the rhyme \"cheater, cheater pumpkin eater.\"  But now? Now Halsey's jumped into G-Eazy's Instagram comments with a bunch of emojis and fans have no idea what to make of it.

Federline and Spears were engaged by July of that year.  Their marriage ceremony took place on September 18, 2004, with son Sean Preston being born barely a year later. Jayden James, their second son, was born a year after that. However, by November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline and began pursuing other romantic interests.  All of the drama surrounding Spears is prompting those closest to her to state that they are worried she may spiral off into something akin to her most famous public meltdown over a decade ago when she had shaved her head amongst other media-covered reckless acts.

However, a new report from OK Magazine claimed that the diva no longer feels connected to her spouse and is ready to move on with her life.  A so-called pal said for many years the legendary singer and songwriter stayed with McGraw because she did not want to break her family.  The publication went on to reveal that Hill has grown tired of McGraw\u2019s love for the ladies.  Speculations on Hill and McGraw\u2019s marriage have been going around for years, and they rarely dispel them.  Instead, during interviews to promote their albums and tours they talk about how strong their love is.  Last year, they sat down with ET\u2018s Keltie Knight and talked anniversary gifts.  Hill said: \u201cHe is good. He does not need to get me anything. Honestly, do you, baby? He is good at giving gifts and making surprises. That is the best gift ever. That is amazing. Do I get to do that four-hour workout with you? No, thank you. That is my gift, no I do not have to do that workout with you.\u201d  McGraw beamed over his wife\u2019s talent by stating: \u201cFor me, it is hearing her sing every night, that is the best part about [the tour]. Cause she is not out there singing much, to see her up on stage, having a great time and just belting it out? I mean, I always say it: when I am on stage with her, it is like NASCAR trying to keep up with an Indy car. She is just that good. So, to me, to watch her sing and see what she does is pretty inspiring.\u201d  He also revealed the secret about having a long and healthy relationship \u2014 let his wife drive.  The \u201cHumble And Kind\u201d singer shared: \u201cMy hot wife, man. Well, the car I drive, the relationship she drives. It is pretty even. We make big decisions about things in different ways, but we always talk about it before we do it. And you know, having three daughters, we acquiesced to mom quite a bit on those decisions.\u201d  He concluded by: \u201cBut I think the key is. You can go into an argument, and your first thought should not always be \u2018Should I be in this relationship?\u2019 That should be the last thought when you argue.\u201d  Advertisement  By the looks of things, these will be making sweet music together for many years to come.",

The couple had previously offered to vacate the property to make way for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but that plan did not come to fruition. As of June, a palace spokesperson told Hello! Magazine that the decision regarding who would move in to the residence had \"not yet been finalized.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis recently spent $10 million for a secluded beachfront vacation home in Carpinteria, California. Located just outside Santa Barbara, the 3,100-square-foot home is surrounded by sand and water on all sides and features six bedrooms and six bathrooms. The house also features a fresh white exterior, contemporary architecture, a large patio, a master bedroom that opens to a wraparound balcony, a cozy fireplace in the living room, vaulted ceilings, a breakfast nook, and a hot tub. Just a short drive away from their A-list avenue home in Beverly Hills, this Carpinteria beach home is the perfect vacation getaway for the small family.",

The former Desperate Housewives star purchased the house for $3.6 million back in August 2006. The lavish contemporary Mediterranean-style home features nine bathrooms and six bedrooms, with a fireplace in each. Common areas in the house are primarily found on the second floor (there are three floors total, connected by a circular staircase with wrought-iron railings), and include a combination living-dining room with two fireplaces and several wood-trimmed glass doors leading out onto a wraparound balcony and a kitchen with an oversize center island and a cozy breakfast nook.  Along with a fireplace, the master suite has a sitting area, not one but two custom-fitted walk-in closets, and a tumbled travertine tiled bathroom with an additional gas fireplace between a large tub and a separate, glass-enclosed steam shower. The home also includes a subterranean ground-floor level with a state-of-the-art screening room, as well as a cavelike family room with a large wet bar and large windows that peek directly into the depth of the swimming pool.

        "doc_1_text": "There's a certain expectation that celebrity homes will be three things: grand, expensive and overlooking a stunning view. The Santa Barbara villa belonging to Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi checks off each of these boxes, but it also comes with a rare, quiet sense of grandeur, emulating the classic style of a 17th-century Italian villa with precision.  The couple just listed the 10,500-square-foot home for $45 million, and it's apparent it was designed to awe. Sitting on what was once two adjacent properties (now a 16.88-acre piece of land), the villa overlooks the ocean and is surrounded by mountains. It has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and two half bathrooms, plus a fitness room, library, sun room and home office, according to the listing.  Jim Bartsch  Perhaps one of the most stunning features is the home's seamless integration of outdoor and indoor living \u2014 typical of California design. An alfresco dining area is nestled below mature trees that provide cool shade on hot summer days, a Roman-style pool is surrounded by lush expanses of grass, and olive and eucalyptus trees line the twisting quarter-mile drive to the entry's 18th-century Spanish gates.  \"The surrounding gardens and olive trees are almost as wonderful as the interior,\" DeGeneres told Sotheby's International Realty. \"The house truly feels like it was built out of the landscape, rather than plopped on a plot. It feels ancient, like it's been there forever. Like that hill was never without the house. It's a home that honors nature, and I love that.\"  Jim Bartsch  DeGeneres and de Rossi purchased the villa, which was featured in DeGeneres' book \"Home,\" in 2012 for $26.5 million, according to People. The estate was built in the 1930s by famed American architect Wallace Frost, who had just returned from living in Italy, entranced by the villas there. Decades later, the home was given a five-year restoration by architectural designer John Saladino, who was captivated by its \"mix of grandeur and modesty.\"  \"The house is always surprising,\" DeGeneres told Sotheby's. \"It reveals itself to you in new ways every day. It's not overly manicured or tidy. It's not overly precious or perfect. And it's a home that manages to be both spacious and cozy at once.\"  Jim Bartsch  Other Italian influences include a classic barrel-tiled roof, wide wood flooring planks, rustic exposed ceiling beans, terra-cotta surfaces, 18th-century Italian tiles, vintage light fixtures and walls of locally quarried stone. Nine fireplaces lend an air of regal warmth to the villa worthy of any royalty \u2014 even Emmy-winning Hollywood royalty.  DeGeneres has made an impression as an incredible house flipper and decorator, with her own home lines ranging from bedding to dining tables. Where she and de Rossi are headed next, we're not sure, but it can only be predicted that it will be as intricately designed and beautiful as this home.  Itching to see more of the estate?

And actress Meghan is chipping in some cash too.  \u2018They are planning on spending $1 million refurbishing the house to their own tastes,\u2019 explains the pal.  Even before the pair got engaged they decided that they were going to split their time between London and LA.  \u2018They toyed with the idea of getting a house in Beverly Hills, but thought it would be much more fun to have a place by the beach,\u2019 they continued.  \u2018They plan on spending three or four months a year in Malibu.

Stern-designed 15 Central Park West for $56 million in May; now the New York Post reports that the massive pad at the headline-stealing celebrity magnet building has been sold to a mystery buyer for $50 million. The couple scooped up the 16th- and 17th-floor penthouse for $27 million in 2008 and enlisted the design pros at SheltonMindel to combine the units to create a unique home with not one but two sculptural spiral staircases and a double-sided spiral gas fireplace that was inspired by the Fibonacci spiral.

The rockstar-worthy residence offers 5,400 square feet of interior space, four bedrooms and 44 feet of frontage along Central Park. The aforementioned fireplace divides the living room from the sitting room, which has built-in bookshelves, with more shelves nearby in the library.  Across the living space is a stylishly-appointed chef\u2019s kitchen\u2013equipped with two refrigerators, four ovens and three dishwashers\u2013and one of the spiral staircases; adjacent is the dining room.  On the second level, accessible by a separate elevator entrance, there\u2019s a luxurious master bedroom with breathtaking Central Park views.

In June 2016, Julia \u2014 whose main home is a $10 million Craftsman-style house atop a bluf in the seaside enclave\u2019s tony Point Dume neighborhood \u2014 previously bought the $6.84 million house directly across the street, so that nannies and visiting family members could have a place to stay.

(Photo Credit: Getty Images)  \u201cShe\u2019s hoping that the purchase of the most expensive surf shack in Malibu will help her marriage by keeping Danny from going away on extended surf trips,\u201d the source tells In Touch. \u201cJulia is hoping that by giving Danny his own incredible surf spot, it will stave of any talk of divorce.\u201d  Most recently, the pair \u2014 who share 12-year-old twins Phinnaeus and Hazel, and son Henry, 10 \u2014 have clashed over Julia\u2019s controlling ways, their differing approaches to parenthood, Danny\u2019s trips away, and his desire to be the man of the house despite being in Julia\u2019s shadow.

Comedian Mike Myers\u2019s Soho penthouse has finally gone into contract three years after he first listed it on the market, 6sqft reports.

The apartment was re-listed on the market for $3 million less last November, and that seems to have finally done the trick.

The newly remodeled pad features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, two spacious walk-in closets, and multiple fireplaces, among other extravagant amenities. Gomez's new spread also boasts a spa-like master bath, an extravagant kitchen, and a chart-topping backyard with a swimming pool, spa, entertaining pavilion, fruit trees, veggie beds, and a grape arbor. Gomez and her boyfriend, The Weeknd, have been on the same page lately, as The Weeknd recently dropped over $20 million on a Hidden Hills estate.

        "generated_text": "Brad Pitt, 53, has been spending more time in the LA arts district known as Frogtown, which has led him to consider purchasing a new place in the hip neighborhood. The actor is looking to convert one of the warehouses into a studio and art gallery and wants to help new and upcoming artists have a voice. He has been spending time at his friend Thomas Houseago's studio and feels a sense of comfort in the art scene because everyone treats him like a regular person. In addition to looking into a new place to call home, Brad has been dating a bit, but sources say he doesn't have a girlfriend and is more comfortable double-dating. Meanwhile, Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have made their first real estate purchase together, a $15.316 million condo on the 36th floor of 432 Park Avenue. Despite only being together for one year, the couple was apartment-hunting together last fall and ultimately landed on the perfect unit. Lopez sold her previous NYC pad for $26.95 million and says she believes in marriage, but is not forcing anything right now.",

        "doc_1_text": "Jennifer Lawrence kicked off her campaign for a fifth Oscar nomination on Thursday night by appearing at a screening of her new film 'Mother!' that was hosted by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.  The 27-year-old actress was joined at the event, which was held at at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, by the film's director Darren Aronofsky, 48, who she began dating after they finished filming the project last year.  Lawrence and her new beau sat through the film's official Academy screening before taking to the stage for a Q&A session with the audience, where they were joined by producer Ari Handel and moderator Sara Wilkomerson.  It was during that chat with a room full of Oscar voters that Lawrence fired off one of her favorite gestures, throwing up a middle finger to the audience while recounting a story about the making of the film.  Aronofsky was certainly amused by the move, which caused him to break down in laughter as he listened to Lawrence speak.  Salute: Jennifer Lawrence flipped off the audience at a screening of her new film 'Mother!' on Thursday night in NYC (above with the film's director and her boyfriend Darren Aronofsky)  Going for the gold: The screening was hosted by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences at MOMA (Larwnce above at the event)  Flipping stoked: Lawrence is not stranger to flashing a middle finger at Oscar events, having also resorted to the gesture back in 2013 when she won the Best Actress trophy for her work in 'Silver Linings Playbook'  Lawrence has long been a big fan of the middle finger salute, pulling it out on red carpets, during interviews and most frequently when encountering members of the paparazzi.  This is also not the first time that she has flipped off audience members at an official Academy event.  The actress famously flashed her middle finger in the press room at the 2013 Academy Awards, just moments after she picked up the Best Actress trophy for her work in 'Silver Linings Playbook.'  She has also been nominated for her leading roles in 'Winter's Bone' and 'Joy' as well as her supporting work in 'American Hustle.'  A fifth nomination next year for her work in 'Mother!' would make her the youngest actor to achieve that feat, with Kate Winslet earning her fifth nod when she was 32 and Meryl Streep not getting there until she was 35.  Noms on noms: Lawrence has also been nominated for her leading roles in 'Winter's Bone' and 'Joy' as well as her supporting work in 'American Hustle'  Move over Meryl: A fifth nomination next year for her work in 'Mother!' would make her the youngest actor to achieve that feat at the age of 27  Style star: The actress looked casually cool in a Brock Collection dress that just walked the runway in New York City earlier this month as part of their Spring 2018 presentation  Lawrence was certainly dressed to impress at the event, wearing a floral dress from Brock Collection that just walked the runway in New York City earlier this month as part of their Spring 2018 presentation.  And once outside she upped the cool factor by tossing on a cropped, black leather jacket from Frame.  It was a bit of a departure for Lawrence, who due to her long-running and lucrative contract with Dior is almost always seen in looks created by the Parisian fashion house while doing press.  Aronofsky meanwhile kept things a bit more simple in navy blue chinos and a green button down.  Perfectly framed: Lawrence tossed on a Frame leather jacket as she stepped outside after the event (above)  California cool: The look was a bit of a departure for Lawrence, who due to her long-running and lucrative contract with Dior is almost always seen in looks created by the Parisian fashion house  Basics: Aronofsky meanwhile kept things a bit more simple in navy blue chinos and a green button down  Lawrence spoke with Wilkomerson ahead of their panel discussion on Thursday for an interview that ran in Entertainment Weekly in which she addressed the polarizing response to her new film.  When asked if the distaste many have expressed for the movie after seeing it in theaters upset her, Lawrence said: 'No, not at all. The people who love it LOVE it and want to see it another time. The people who don\u2019t like, absolutely despise it.'  She went on to say: 'There is no middle ground. We knew that it was divided. That\u2019s what so exciting \u2014 everybody is going to feel something. It\u2019s going to create a conversation. It\u2019s going to create a controversy. Nobody is going to leave not getting something from it.'  Lawrence was also sure to express her admiration for Aranofsky, who was previously nominated for his film 'Black Swan' in the Best Director category.  That picture earned his leading lady Natalie Portman the Best Actress Oscar, and his previous film 'Requiem for a Dream' landed Ellen Burstyn a nod in the same category back in 2000, where she lost to Julia Roberts.  The three mother-keteers: Lawrence and Aronofsky were also joined by the film's producer, Ari Handel (above)  Say what: Lawrence said that the negative response some have to the film is not a problem for her, stating: 'There is no middle ground. We knew that it was divided. That\u2019s what so exciting'  Beaming beaus: Lawrence, 27, and Aronofsky, 48, began dating after they finished filming the project last year (pair above at the NYC premiere on September 13)  Aronofsky also spoke about how his new film has divided audiences in an interview with The Frame earlier this week.  'We always knew it was a strong cocktail. It came very much from a place of a lot of frustration and I guess a certain amount of impotent rage on what was going on in the world,' said the director.  'I just kind of took all that passion that I was thinking of outside of my filmmaking work and tried to turn it into a story. And I think this isn't a reflection on what's happening right now in the way we treat our mother.'  He then added: ' But it's also a cautionary tale which I actually like because in a cautionary tale there's room for optimism and I'm very much an optimist.'",

The Nic-aissance has officially hit Cannes, with Nicole Kidman promoting no fewer than four movies at the film festival this year.  The actress understands that the notorious press calls, complete with wall-to-wall photographers, on those red carpet steps, are the most important aspect of a movie's promotion.  Where else but in Cannes do we witness the perfect melange of decadence, frivolity and just a splash of tacky? Not even The Met Ball can guarantee this level of fashion extra-ness.  Andreas Rentz The couple starts with some hand-holding...  This goes some way to explaining the piece of performance art produced by Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, at the premiere of The Killing of a Scared Deer.  READ MORE:  * Naomie Harris barefoot in Cannes is all of us after a big night out  * Sofia Coppola and Nicole Kidman lead Cannes Film Festival 2017 lineup  * Best & worst dressed: 2016 Cannes Film Festival so far  JEAN-PAUL PELISSIER And some hand-kissing...  The nuzzles, the elongated looks, the soft nibbles on the neck, the fingers, entwined in climactic pleasure, all combine to create what might best be titled \"Le Public de Love Making\", which is probably the grossest sentence ever written, but if the oversized tutu fits ...  At one point, Urban took hold of his wife's long hair and gently pulled at it while gripping her bare back, in what might be described as a classic Mills and Boon cover move.  It isn't the first time the couple have put their PDA on display. It's actually something of a sensuous habit. At this year's Oscars, Kidman and Urban engaged in the sort of kissing normally reserved for couples bidding farewell at the airport\u2026 in a private room\u2026 on a military base.  ERIC GAILLARD There's also a bit of eye-gazing...  When Kidman is able to come up for air, she tends to look a little coy. This moment is usually alleviated by Urban through prolonged eye contact followed by a \"presentation\" of his wife to photographers.  If the move seems familiar, it's because it is.  In 1992, when Kidman made her debut at Cannes, she arrived with her then husband, Tom Cruise, a man who is not shy of presenting wives and belief-defying displays of public affection.  ERIC GAILLARD There's even a few tears.  All of which begs, was it Tom who influenced Nicole, or the other way around? Kidman, who has admitted to social introversion, has said several times that she finds the red carpet nerve-wracking, and to ease her butterflies, she goes into her own private world.  This admission makes sense \u2013 it's not performance PDA then, but an attempt to cope with the onslaught of cameras.  It also explains why she also held hands with, and leaned on Colin Farrell at the premiere, too. Although, considering Farrell has lost none of his own scrappy brand of Celtic sensuality, there's really no explanation required.",

But it looks as if the Oscar-winning actress has been getting close to another director lately - her longtime collaborator David O Russell, whom she has made the films Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and Joy with.  On Thursday the 27-year-old actress and the 59-year-old director were seen arm-in-arm as they left a three-hour dinner at Felice Ristorante & Wine Bar in New York City. They even traded off wearing a New York cap, proving how cozy they are.  Having fun in the Big Apple: Jennifer Lawrence looked very chummy with director David O Russell on Thursday evening in New York City  Laughter and smiles: The two got along like wildfire as he held a bag from Felice Ristorante & Wine Bar  They are a good team: The 59-year-old has directed the 27-year-old star in three films  He has a special lady at home: The lauded director has been in a long-term relationship with Holly Davis; seen here in 2014 in LA  Jennifer looked to be in great spirits as she held on to the acclaimed director while walking down a dark street.  At times she laughed and smiled with the dashing salt-and-pepper Russell, who is a graduate of Amherst College.  The Red Sparrow actress wore a thick black winter coat over an ivory colored turtleneck as well as black slacks.  The Kentucky native added a bit of sex appeal with her strappy black heels that showed off a pretty pedicure. The footwear didn't seem sensible as it had just rained.  So close! The beauty planted a kiss on the director at the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards  On set: David directing Jennifer on Silver Linings Playbook, left, and American Hustle, right  Their third collaboration: The award winner with Robert De Niro in the 2015 film Joy  Her other accessories were a New York sports cap - which David also had on for a while - and black purse with gunmetal grey chain strap.  Russell was much more dressed down in a black puffy jacket and black slacks with old dad white sneakers and his hair in a messy hipster style.  The whole time they walked down the street they were arm-in-arm suggesting they have a very close relationship.  At one point they seemed to get into a mini disagreement, but it all seemed good natured.

Jennifer started working with Russell with the 2012 hit film The Silver Linings Playbook which also starred Bradley Cooper.  Her role as an aspiring ballroom dancer who manages to melt the heart of Cooper's angry loser won her an Academy Award.  His man look: Russell was much more dressed down in a puffy jacket and black slacks with old dad white sneakers and his hair in a messy hipster style  Say what? At one point they seemed to get into a mini disagreement, but it all seemed good natured  Next David hired her to star in 2013's American Hustle, which also starred Cooper.  This time instead of playing the kooky girl, she was the classless but very sexy neglected wife of Christian Bale's character.  Again she was handed an Oscar nomination but she didn't win.  Now with her hat off: As they walked by a restaurant she let her blonde locks be seen; her hat was on his head at this point  Back on: Now she has the hat on her head; it also seemed as if they were holding hands here  Can't let go: They seemed to be arm in arm for blocks and blocks; this was after a three hour dinner inside the cozy Italian restaurant  Bonded early: Jennifer started working with Russell with the 2012 hit film The Silver Linings Playbook which also starred Bradley Cooper.

She will work on Bad Blood with director Adam McKay. And she is set to reprise her role as Raven/Mystique in the 2019 film X-Men: Dark Phoenix.

The couple, who have been together for years, stepped out to view a production of Skeleton Crew at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles.  https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkt2i7LhsN6/?tagged=hollandtaylor  Every time these two are spotted out and about, you can hear the pitter-pattering of thumbs as queer women rapidly text each other screenshots of the couple. However, each time Paulson and Taylor are spotted together, every writer feels the need to focus on the major age gap between the two women, rather than reporting on any other aspect of their relationship. My question is: When will we move on from their ages, which clearly don\u2019t matter, and start focusing on the more pressing issues at hand\u2014like their outfits?!  Outside the Geffen Playhouse, Taylor was captured in a fitted beige suit, worn with high-waisted trousers, a chic blazer and matching bag. Paulson was pictured wearing a high-neck patterned dress and ankle-length jacket draped over her shoulders. The Ocean\u2019s 8 actress is no stranger to the pants and blazer look\u2014after filming the 2018 con movie and Carol with Cate Blanchett, the queen of suits herself, who can blame her? Although, I did notice she typically goes for a dress while being photographed with her girlfriend, who usually sports a suit. The combo allows for an extremely stylish swirl of masc and femme glory.  Earlier this year, the couple attended the Oscars together, and Holland sported a tuxedo-like black suit with a femme twist on the cummerbund. On her arm, Ms. Sarah glowed in a lurid yellow dress and fashion gloves\u2014one of my favorite of their looks. And while we\u2019re here, I\u2019m officially declaring fashion gloves gay. Fashion gloves are canonically gay.  Here they are on a red carpet, gazing into each other\u2019s souls while Holland wears a shimmery jacket and matching pants. The couple met over a decade ago, while Paulson was dating someone else. But she told The New York Times that her first impression of the Legally Blonde actress was that she\u2019s \u201cprobably the most exquisitely beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d  Here they are in matching button-up shirts. As we already know, button-up shirts are not only canonically queer, but they belong to queer women. Like overalls. Dress shirts, buttoned all the way to the neck, are the overalls of evening wear.  Oh, look\u2014Holland in a white blazer with pinstriped cuffs and Sarah in a heathered tan sweater, with a dash of matching black shirts beneath. In Sarah\u2019s 2016 Emmy acceptance speech, she shouted into the mic, \u201cHolland Taylor, I love you.\u201d And, well\u2026same.  Here\u2019s Sarah coyly accepting Holland\u2019s hand while donning her very own Lesbian Plaid Jacket. It\u2019s very Clueless-chic.  And lest we forget the time they dressed up in a whole different kind of suit\u2014bodysuit Halloween costumes. Too cute! How old are they again? Who cares!  Bottom line, they\u2019re adorable and seem unimaginably happy together\u2014even happier than Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson, who seem pretty out-of-this-world smitten. So, let\u2019s stop focusing on age\u2014which is just a number\u2014and start focusing on something much more gripping and relevant in today\u2019s political climate: Women\u2019s suits. And coats. Mostly suits.",

        "doc_2_text": "  Pitt and Aniston at the Independent Spirit Awards on 3/22/03. Credit: Glenn Harris / PR Photos  Both Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have films out that premiere at the Toronto Film Festival later this month, and US is breathlessly reporting that the ex husband and wife might run into each other \u2013 gasp! Aniston , Pitt and his girlfriend Angelina Jolie were sort-of supposed to meet at a charity dinner they were all listed as co-hosting during the Oscars in February. Aniston went to the event for an hour, but Pitt and Jolie were no-shows, which wasn\u2019t surprising as there were 10 other hosts listed and not all of them came to the event. Brad and Angelina went to the Independent Spirit Awards instead, where Angelina first showed off her pregnant belly in a tight black dress.  Now exes Brad and Jennifer, who split up in January, 2005 after four and a half years of marriage, might see each other again at this film festival. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be cordial to each other if they end up even speaking. Maybe someone behind the scenes will work to ensure they don\u2019t cross paths though:  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston could reunite at this year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, when the exes are debuting their new flicks just two days apart. Pitt, 44, is among the stars who will walk the red carpet gala at the festival for the North American premiere of his Coen Brothers\u2019 flick Burn After Reading on Sept. 5. (Pitt is also expected to attend the Venice Film Festival, where his film screens on August 27.) Meanwhile, Aniston, 39, is scheduled to attend the Toronto fest to promote her romantic comedy Management \u2014 about a traveling art saleswoman fighting off the advances of a flaky motel manager \u2014 which is premiering Sept. 7.  [From US Weekly]  I would bet this meeting never happens and Brad blows in and out of there before Jennifer\u2019s film premieres. He does have six kids at home now and probably can\u2019t be away for several days at a time.  It also seems like they\u2019ve both moved on despite the tabloid\u2019s unwillingness to let go. Last week a columnist at the Chicago Sun Times reported that an insider claimed Jennifer \u201cstill is hurting from losing Brad [Pitt] to Angelina [Jolie] \u2014 even after all this time.\u201d How true do you think that is, though? Maybe she thinks about it once in a while, but surely it doesn\u2019t consume her like it still seems to dominate the press. Three years isn\u2019t a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but it\u2019s enough time to carve a new life for yourself, which Aniston has surely done \u2013 even if she hasn\u2019t found a lasting love. She\u2019s living single, and it looks like she\u2019s living damn well. A lot of happily attached women would love a taste of that healthy carefree life. They\u2019ll just have to settle for slugging some of that Vitamin water she endorses.",

Harington and Leslie tied the knot on Saturday in a romantic ceremony at Kirkton of Rayne church in Scotland. The star-studded celebration \u2014 which includes many Game of Thrones stars as guests \u2014 is set to continue at the bride's family's castle.  While walking down the aisle, Leslie, 31, looked radiant in an delicate long-sleeve lacy dress. The actress wore a floral garland on her head as well as a white veil, which appeared to extend all the way from the top of her head to the hem of her gown.  Leslie also carried a small bouquet of flowers.  Rose Leslie and Kit Harington. SplashNews.com  SplashNews.com  The groom also was dressed formally for the occasion, wearing a black jacket, a cream-colored vest and a pair of striped pants.  Jane Barlow/PA Images/Getty Images  The pair's special day was also attended by plenty of Harington and Leslie's GoT costars. Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams \u2014 who play sisters on the beloved HBO drama \u2014 were seen arriving at the venue together on Saturday.  Turner, who is engaged to singer Joe Jonas, wore a red suit dress with a pair of over-the-knee length black boots to the ceremony, which she accessorized with a pair of red sunglasses and a black-and-white checkered purse.  Williams, 21, opted for a more low-key look and wore a black jumpsuit with a pair of red heels.  Ahead of the ceremony, Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke were also seen arriving in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Friday. Dinklage has picked up two Emmy Awards and one Golden Globe for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, while Clarke plays Daenerys Targaryen (Harington's current love interest and, ahem, long-lost aunt on the show).

The couple got engaged in September 2017, confirming the happy news the old-fashioned (and very British) way: through a classified advert in The Times.  In October, though, the actor admitted to botching his proposal a bit during an appearance on the U.K.'s Jonathan Ross Show.  \"I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,\" he said before laughing at the sexual insinuation. \"Sorry, that's a really bad expression!\"  The actors first stirred up relationship rumors in 2012, in sync with their fictional GoT counterparts, Jon Snow and Ygritte.  After a brief split, the couple reconciled and continued to fuel romance speculation until they officially confirmed the relationship in April 2016. They made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Olivier Awards in London.  They became close while on set in Iceland shooting for season 2. Harington previously opened up about the early days of their romance, admitting that those weeks were his favorite of the series.  \"Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,\" he said in a cover story for L'Uomo Vogue. \"If you're already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.\"",

Portia was looking radiant from head to heels as she attended the Arrested Development season four premiere in Los Angeles on the arm of her talk show partner.  The slender 40-year-old was wearing a sleek-fitting, long-sleeved black brocade dress with sheer cut-a-way details on the sides and back.  Glamorous: Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi were arm in arm at the Arrested Development season four premiere in Los Angeles on Monday  The hemline stopped short of her knees to reveal shapely calves and slim ankles, and there were black pointed heels on her feet.  Portia wore her light blonde hair short and spiked on top, which added even more height to her five-foot-seven inches.  The former Ally McBeal star has always tended to be the girly one of the couple and proved that point again on this occasion.

The actress presented her former co-star with an honorary award at the 11th annual Costume Designers Guild Awards held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.    It was a rare get-together for the pair, who have been photographed by each other's side only twice since the 1992 sexual thriller became a blockbuster sensation.    And while Stone turned 50 last year and Douglas is approaching his 65th birthday, it's clear both have managed to hold back the years.    Rolling back the years: Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone at the 11th annual Costume Designers Guild Awards held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel  Of course, Douglas has spent a fortune on plastic surgery, having the first facelift he will admit to for his wedding to Catherine Zeta Jones nine years ago.  However, Stone has maintained she is a 'natural beauty' and in 2004 launched legal action after a Beverly Hills doctor allegedly told a US magazine that he performed cosmetic surgery on her face.  She certainly looked as youthful - and glamorous - as ever last night in a mauve halter-neck dress that showed off her famous figure in all its glory.  Rare reunion: The pair have been photographed together only a handful of times since the 1992 hit    Chemistry: The pair in Basic Instinct  Stone, who has three adopted sons, reprised her role as ice-pick wielding novelist Catherine Trammell for Basic Instinct 2 three years ago.  However, Douglas, who played detective Nick Curran in the original movie, turned down the offer amid whispers he considered himself too old for the part.  Relative unknown British actor David Morrissey took his place instead.    It was in hindsight, a wise career move - the sequel bombed at the box office and was widely panned by critics.    The film even won four Razzies at an awards ceremony that honours the worst of Hollywood, including worst picture and worst actress for Stone.  The original movie, in which Stone's character is a bisexual writer who may or may not be involved in a frenzied murder, was famed for its scene where Trammell uncrosses her legs during an interview with Douglas' detective, revealing she is wearing no lingerie.    Mutual admiration: Stone presented her former co-star with the Swarovski President's award        ",

And on Friday the 46-year-old actor finally addressed the painful split in a new interview with InStyle magazine.  'It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to be single after being together for a long time. It\u2019s really hard. It sucks,' the Mad Men actor said.  Honesty: Jon Hamm broke up with girlfriend of 18 years, actress Jennifer Westfeldt, nearly two years ago; he spoke about the split to InStyle magazine  This comes after he was linked to Kate Beckinsale.  Hamm and the beauty were seen flirting at the screening of his new movie Baby Driver at the London Hotel in West Hollywood.  An onlooker told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column: 'They were flirting and he kept going back to her all night. It was like he couldn't leave her.'  Strike a pose: On Friday the 46-year-old actor finally addressed the painful split in a new interview with InStyle magazine  Guns! He also showed off his muscles as he lifted his shirt while looking at plants  For the shoot, Hamm flexed his muscles while rocking denim; he also posed in neutral hues.  Also in the InStyle interview Hamm talked about the issues he has.  'I may be a narcissist in the way that most actors are, but I think it\u2019s not to the detriment of those in my life. I try to be a good friend, a good partner, and all that stuff.'  Hamm added: 'I\u2019m not perfect, and it hurts when you hurt other people. But the hope is to find the right balance so you can care about your own stuff enough to live your life and do your job well while also not being a monster.'  He then alluded to his rehab visit in February 2015.  The ex: Jon Hamm broke up with longtime girlfriend, actress Jennifer Westfeldt, nearly two years ago. And on Friday the 46-year-old actor finally addressed the painful split in a new interview with InStyle magazine; seen in 2014  'Medical attention is medical attention whether it\u2019s for your elbow or for your teeth or for your brain, and it\u2019s important,' said the star.  'We live in a world where to admit anything negative about yourself is seen as a weakness, when it\u2019s actually a strength. It\u2019s not a weak move to say, \"I need help.\" In the long run it\u2019s way better, because you have to fix it.'  And then he got very candid about his problems.  'I\u2019m certainly damaged \u2014 there\u2019s no denying it,' he admitted.  'If you look at the history of my life, it\u2019s not great. When your mom dies when you\u2019re nine, and your dad dies when you\u2019re 20, and then you live on couches in other people\u2019s basements \u2026 I mean, there\u2019s certainly a version of that person who does not come out of it as successfully as I have.'  New love? Jon Hamm 'couldn't leave' Kate Beckinsale's side at an event in LA on Wednesday; here they are seen at earlier premieres  She was there: The Mad Men star, 46, was taken by the British beauty, 43, and was 'flirting' with her at a screening of his new movie Baby Driver at the London Hotel in West Hollywood; here she is pictured at the event with Edgar Wright  As far as Kate, she is single after a split from husband Len Wiseman in November 2015.  Kate is known for the close friendship she has retained with Michael Sheen, whom she has a teenager with, and recently admitted he will always be 'family' to her.  Asked what the secret is to their longstanding friendship, she said: 'Well one, pick well. And two, I think we both really felt like, we really agreed on what would be the right thing for Lily. And I think, you know, not hating each other and fighting and all that would be awful for her.  'I think we've also got a really similar sense of humour, and I do find that humour can save an awful lot of things and help a lot of things.  With a pal: Here Hamm is seen at the Baby Driver event with Star Wars vet Mark Hamill  'I just really like him. He's family. I've known him since I was 21, so he's proper family now.'  And Kate regularly spends time with the Masters Of Sex star and his current partner Sarah Silverman and the group tend to spend Christmas and Thanksgiving together.  She added to Entertainment Tonight: 'Well, we had Thanksgiving at his girlfriend's house and they're having Christmas at our house.  'We like hanging out with each other, so it's not like, \"Oh, who gets Lily?\" or whatever. It's like, \"Whose house are we going to be at?\"'",

(Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage) Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImage  There's a third character in the friendship tale of Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone: John the Orchestra Guy.  Who is John? An orchestra guy, that's who -- an orchestra guy who used to constantly, \"accidentally\" text both Stone and Lawrence.  \"He wasn't really a stalker. He's just this guy who has a lot of people's phone numbers,\" Stone said in an interview for W's Best Performances feature. \"He must have worked at a studio or something.\"  According to Stone, John would often text both women to inform them he was running late to the \"soundstage.\" He'd then asked them to \"warm up the orchestra\" for him. (Now you see where the \"orchestra\" part of the name comes from!)  Weird, right? But no harm done.  An issue arose, however, when Lawrence and Stone -- who had never met in person, nor talked on the phone -- decided to finally hang out IRL. As Lawrence drove to Stone's house, a fear emerged. What if this wasn't Emma after all, but a trap from John the Orchestra Guy? What if this was a John the Orchestra Guy setup?  Waiting at home, Stone had the same fear.  Spoiler: neither of them was John the Orchestra Guy. They had a nice hangout and are still friends. Once they even went to dinner with Adele!  So, John the Orchestra Guy, thanks (we think) for bringing two great friends a little closer. Hope the orchestra ended up being ready for you after all.

She had to hit the rise and fall of the movement, essentially matching Boylston - if not in quality than in dynamics and with the correct paulement, or placement of the shoulders.  Jennifer Lawrence has danced before on film, memorably in a duet with Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook. But while it was a delight, the number, despite a couple of harrowing lifts, had little in common with ballet.  Froman is \"the ballet-boot-camp guy, and in a great way,\" Francis Lawrence said. \"He knows how to teach ballet to lay people, to ease them in as best as possible.\" And he knows their limits, Lawrence added. \"He was the one who told me: 'Jen will never get up on pointe. It's too dangerous.'\"  For three and a half months, Froman worked with Lawrence \u2013 mainly in her garage in Los Angeles \u2013 for four hours a day, five days a week. They started with stretching and working with discs to help Lawrence grasp turnout, or the opening of the legs from the hips.  \"I wanted her to understand what muscle groups were involved, and how most people walking on the street are internally rotated with their shoulders \u2013 their palms are facing back,\" Froman said. \"With ballet dancers, you have to spin that back so it looks more like their arms are an extension of their back, and that whole alignment lengthens your neck. It widens your shoulder line.\"  Froman made her hold a ball to bring awareness to her arm. \"When there's weight in it and when you're activating those fingers, it's different than just having your arm as a prop or lifeless,\" he said. \"By the time we started working on choreography, she had beautiful hands and a really nice neck and shoulders.\"  And he didn't make the exercises easy. \"Even for an actor, they have to understand this world,\" he said. \"It's almost like a religion. Every day there's a checklist going through your head: Where's my centre of gravity? Are my ribs closed?\"  During the filming, Froman stood behind the camera facing Lawrence instead of using a microphone as he talked her through the movement. \"I wanted it to be just between the two of us,\" he said. \"Immediately, she performed exactly the quality of work that we had rehearsed. It didn't all go out the window because of nerves.\"",

        "doc_2_text": "The sun may be shining in Los Angeles, but there's still a cool breeze.  Jennifer Garner stayed warm and cozy on Tuesday by wearing a multi-colored and oversized scarf (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's infamous outerwear he wore in 2012) while out with her gal pals in L.A. on her birthday. The former Alias star, who turned 46 this week, outfitted the knitted scarf with sporty black leggings, a gray zip-up jacket, red-white-and-blue sneakers and tortoiseshell shades. Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.  BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  Garner later revealed on Instagram that that the massive scarf was a birthday gift from her daughter Seraphina.  \"When your nine year old weaves a 12ft long scarf on a peg loom for your birthday present, you\u2019d better #werk #fashionfriday #thecarpoollineismyrunway #proudmom,\" she captioned another pic of her colorful fashion statement.  The actress appeared to have been in good spirits during her birthday, turning herself into a meme and taking to Instagram to thank everyone for their well wishes.  \"I\u2019m having the best birthday and so much of it is because of all of you. Thank you for the birthday love! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f,\" she wrote alongside the silly pic of herself doing her hair.  Undoubtedly, 46 will be a good year for Garner as she makes her return to television with the series Camping, will kick-ass in the spy-thriller Peppermint, and continues to treat fans to all her wonderful Instagram videos and pics.

Selena Gomez proved that a little black dress never goes out of style and Demi Lovato matched her lilac eyeshadow to her body-hugging Alice + Olivia dress.  This week, Hollywood's most fashion-forward stars let statement pieces speak for themselves. Whether it was a bold lip, a power suit, mismatched heels or an oversized blue floral pin, A-listers chose key accessories to stand out and express their individuality.  From streetwear to red carpet glamour, these celebrities slayed the fashion game for the week of Oct. 22. ET has all the details on the best dressed stars -- and where you can get their looks!  Demi Lovato  Getty Images  The \"Confident\" singer wowed in a show-stopping silky lilac Alice + Olivia gown with a thigh-high slit and belted waist at the InStyle Awards in Los Angeles on Oct. 23.  Lovato paired the $395 body-hugging dress with barely-there glittery pointed toe Gianvito Rossi heels retailing $795 and a whopping $19,000 Leticia Linton Lavender Cocktail Ring. She finished off her sleek look with a matching lavender eye and nude lip.  Leticia Linton Design  Kate Bosworth  Getty Images  Another celeb who dazzled at the InStyle Awards was Kate Bosworth, who was all sparkles in a gold Alexandre Vauthier long-sleeve dress with a high slit and blue flower pinned to her shoulder.  The 34-year-old actress had her hair slicked back and wore a bold red lip, accessorizing her stunning look with Louboutin black strappy heels, a $315,000 13.28 carat Norman Silverman diamond ring set and 8.86 carat diamond Norman Silverman earrings, which cost $36,000.  Selena Gomez  Getty Images  A special shout-out also goes to the \"Fetish\" singer, who jumped on the mismatched shoe trend with her Jacquemus heels at the InStyle Awards. Retailing for $655, one shoe featured a yellow circle as a heel, while the other had two wooden blocks and a ball in a darker shade.  Gomez showed off her unique pair of sandals with a $465 sexy spaghetti strap LBD from the same designer's Spring 2006 runway collection.  Getty Images  Harry Styles  Backgrid  The \"Sign of the Times\" singer is a natural when it comes to fashion. On Oct. 25, Styles was spotted looking casually cool in a Solar System-Intarsia cashmere sweater by The Elder Statesmen, knitted with a colorful solar system and retailing for $2,348.55.  He paired the statement sweater with black skinny jeans, brown boots and tortoise shell Ray-Ban sunglasses.  THE ELDER STATESMAN  Kaia and Presley Gerber  Getty Images  The model siblings made a chic appearance at the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Show and Tea at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles on Oct. 25.  Kaia, 16, looked picture perfect in a plaid sleeveless Veronica Beard Finn dress from the designer's Spring 2018 collection, which she paired with white strappy, pointed-toe heels and a rectangular-shaped red clutch. Meanwhile, Presley, 18, looked dapper in black trousers, a white button-up and black-and-white sneakers. Sibling goals!  Nikki Reed  Getty Images  The 29-year-old actress was just as excited as we were about her chic Spring 2017 Ready to Wear Emporio Armani bright pink suit she wore at the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Show on Oct. 25.  The fashion-forward garb featured candy cane stripes on the bottom of the trousers and on the blazer's sleeves, as well as tiny elephant prints. Letting the pajama-inspired outfit speak for itself, Reed kept the rest at a minimal with single-strap silver heels and no jewelry.  \"If you know me, you know I love pajamas. But pajamas with tiny elephants all over them?! Come on! @emporioarmani you made all my dreams come true,\" the new mom posted on Instagram about her ensemble.  Amal Clooney  Getty Images  As if the 39-year-old human rights lawyer couldn't get any more beautiful, Amal stunned at the Suburbicon premiere at the Village Theatre in Los Angeles, California on Oct. 22. Amal looked ethereal in a Greek goddess-inspired strapless blue-and-white Bill Blass gown from the designer's Spring 2007 collection. The mother of two complemented her look with 18 karat white gold and diamond torpedo Lorraine Schwartz earrings and a silver Judith Leiber rectangular clutch priced at $2,995.  ET spoke with Amal's hubby, George, at the premiere, where he gushed about his 4-month-old twins, Alexander and Ella. \"This is an important part of my life's journey and this is really, truly the largest step in fatherhood for me at this point,\" the 56-year-old first-time dad expressed.  Gigi and Bella Hadid  James Devaney/GC Images  The supermodel sisters made us do a double take with their posh Chanel ensembles they wore at V Magazine\u2019s Intimate Dinner in Honor of Karl Lagerfeld at the Top of the Standard in New York City on Oct. 23.

Meanwhile, Bella, 21, took an edgier route, donning a $13,600 black double face embroidered lambskin coat from the same collection, a $1,475 belt and Chanel black fingerless gloves, purse and pointed toe heels. So fierce!  Ana de Armas  Getty Images  The 29-year-old actress oozed elegance at the Blade Runner 2049 premiere at Roppongi Hills in Tokyo, Japan, on Oct. 24. The Cuban actress looked whimsical in a romantic pale pink long-sleeved Giambattista Valli gown from the Spring 2017 Couture collection.  The floral chiffon dress featured a high collar topped with frills and decorated with blue, white and green crystals around the neck, sleeves and waist. Armas completed her hyper-feminine look with her hair wisped back in a low bun and light-and-fresh makeup.  Shantel VanSanten  Rich Fury/Getty Images  The Shooter star was the perfect combination of sexy and cute at the Platt Boutique Jewelry and The Kit Vintage Opening Celebration in Los Angeles on Oct. 24.  VanSanten looked timeless in a powder blue Elisabetta Franchi Fall 2017 blazer and cropped trousers, which she stylishly paired with a matching Zita bag by Lei Lou by Alex Dojcinovic, a silver chain belt with stars and gold-and-silver Aquazzura heels.

So it is perhaps of little surprise Victoria Beckham, 43, also holds sway with her eldest son's girlfriend.  The fashion entrepreneur appears to have started slowly influencing the style of American actress Chloe Grace Moretz, who has been dating Brooklyn, 18, on-and-off for a number of years.  Chloe, 20, has been spotted wearing a number of pieces from Victoria's eponymous label - stepping out in at least five garments in the last week alone.  She also shares Victoria's love of sharp tailoring and feminine details, with side-by-side comparisons revealing strikingly similar looks.  Here, FEMAIL breaks down four outfits Miss Moretz has borrowed from the Victoria Beckham look book...  Tuxedo coat and blouse  Chloe Grace Moretz wore black trousers and a black tuxedo coat from Victoria Beckham when she attended a gala dinner in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the weekend. She finished the stylish ensemble with a pair of glittery pumps, also Victoria Beckham. Right, the coat on a model  Chloe's high-collared blouse with ruffle detailing looked strikingly similar to one worn by Posh at the Harper\u2019s Bazaar Women of the Year awards at Claridge\u2019s last November, pictured  For an event in Utah over the weekend, Chloe plumped for not one, but three different Victoria Beckham pieces.  She brought a touch of elegance in black Victoria Beckham trousers, which she teamed with a matching tuxedo coat that gave her a longline tailored silhouette.  The starlet also sported a pair of silver glittery heels from the designer, which Victoria herself has previously worn in public.  She finished the look with a high-collared blouse with ruffle detailing, which looked strikingly similar to one worn by Posh at the Harper\u2019s Bazaar Women of the Year awards at Claridge\u2019s last November.

She teamed the blazer and straight-legged trousers with a simple white t-shirt.  Chloe finished the look with a pair of pointed heeled boots that looked very like ones worn by Victoria at JFK a month earlier.  The \u00a3725 cashmere turtleneck  The actress donned a sumptuous \u00a3725 cashmere turtleneck sweater by the designer, pictured, as she attended two film premieres at the Sundance Film Festival on Monday  Chloe appears to turn to Victoria Beckham even when it comes to more casual looks.

        "doc_1_text": "Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring is definitely fit for a queen. The young Game of Thrones starlet prepares to join house Jonas, and took to Instagram to spread the word. Sophie and fianc\u00e9 Joe Jonas raced each other to social media, posting the same sweet photo of their two hands, with Sophie sporting a dazzling diamond engagement ring. The bride-to-be captioned the pic with, \u201cI said yes,\u201d, while Jonas echoed the sentiment, writing, \u201cShe said yes!\u201d  The starstruck couple was first introduced in 2016 by mutual friend Hailee Steinfeld who met Sophie on the set of Barely Legal, and Joe during collaboration with his band DNCE. The relationship began right away but the couple did not officially confirm it until the HBO after-party for the Golden Globes in January of 2017.  No news yet about the date of the much anticipated wedding, but we do know that sisterly co-star Maisie Williams will in fact be a bridesmaid.  If you are looking for all the details about Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring, you\u2019ve come to the right place!  You\u2019ll find out:  What style Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring is  What size the diamonds on Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring are  How much Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring is worth  Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring pictures  In a collaborated effort both Turner and Jonas posted an understated, yet chic, debut of the engagement ring on October 15th, 2017.  There is just no mistaking that unique pear shape, or even more surprising double band.  Here\u2019s a cheeky flash of the front of Sophie Turner\u2019s dazzling engagement ring. Now let\u2019s get to the details!  What style setting is Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring?  Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring is a solitaire pear-cut diamond set on a double pav\u00e9 band, in white gold.  This clean and modern setting symbolizes the balance that the two will hopefully enjoy in their marriage. It is also very fashion forward and perfect for an independent, fiery personality like Sophie.  What shape is Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring diamond?  The center stone of Sophie Turner\u2019s ring is a sleek pear cut diamond. The pear is the most brilliant of all fancy cuts, consisting of 58 facets, just like a brilliant round cut. It is the ultimate option for style without sacrificing sparkle. It suits a woman who is confident, and not afraid to stand out.  Always be careful to protect the delicate tip of a pear-cut, as you don\u2019t want it to get stuck or snagged on fabric.  The best bet to safeguard your pear is a six-prong setting. This way, five prongs hold the diamond snugly in place, while the sixth prong guards the point.  How many carats is Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring?  Joe Jonas must have asked his fellow famous brothers for advice, because he did great!  Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring is a stunner of a three carat diamond.  How much did Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring cost? And what\u2019s it really worth?!  While Joe Jonas\u2019 representation has been tight-lipped on the subject, a 3 carat pear diamond with good color and clarity can cost around $60,000:  Allowing for $5,000 for a custom, pav\u00e9 setting to complement the stone, and it\u2019s likely that Joe Jonas spent around $65,000 on Sophie\u2019s ring.  Sophie Turner\u2019s Engagement Ring Copy  Don\u2019t worry, it is definitely possible to steal the style of Sansa Stark, err\u2026 I mean, Sophie Turner, and I\u2019ve found three regal options to consider.  The first up is the closest match, with a pav\u00e9 double band in 14k white gold, mimicking Sophie Turner\u2019s engagement ring style. The petite halo around the center stone creates the illusion of added stone size as well. Click here to learn more about this 14k White Gold Double Shank Pear Halo Engagement Ring by my recommended retailer James Allen.  This next option also features a double pav\u00e9 band, but with an added literal twist. It jazzes the concept of the double band up a little, so you can put your own unique spin on Sophie\u2019s style. Click here to learn more about this Empress French Pav\u00e9 Diamond Engagement Ring from my recommended retailer Blue Nile.  Last, but certainly not least is yet another interesting take on Sophie Turner\u2019s double band. This setting features no added pav\u00e9, but instead sports an intricate twist, for an understated yet interesting look. Set in 14k white gold this setting compliments the center stone without stealing the show.

After a small group of family and friends-who had been invited to a \"special barbecue\"-were let in on the secret, the celebration of life and love began.  02 of 11 The Lyrics A wagon wheel-the name of O'Connell and Romijn's ranch-motif adorned songs sheets handed to the guests, who joined in as a gospel choir serenaded the bride down the aisle with a chorus of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is.\" \"I picked that song because I liked the sentiment,\" Romijn has said. \"I was creating an experience for everybody, myself included.\"  03 of 11 The Gown Joe Buissink Romijn's father, Jaap, escorted her down the grassy aisle. The bride paired her lace Ralph Lauren gown with a gold bracelet and chandelier earrings with multi-colored diamonds borrowed from famed jeweler Neil Lane. And her something blue? \"I had a tiny blue bow sewn inside my dress,\" Romijn says.  04 of 11 The Menu Joe Buissink After the ceremony, planned by Heidi Asimus of Red25 events, guests dined on blue crab salad and lavender-grilled prime beef tenderloin at rustic tables adorned with ivory plates and old-fashioned champagne glasses.

After speeches from the well-wishers, the groom got up to perform Vanessa Williams's \"Save the Best for Last.\" The artist insisted on finishing the song.  09 of 11 The Party Joe Buissink Romijn's Ugly Betty co-stars ,Vanessa Williams and Becki Newton (with her husband, actor Chris Diamantopoulos), celebrated with sparklers after the sun went down. The country-themed party space included long wooden farm tables set with lanterns, field flowers and vintage dish-towel napkins.  10 of 11 The Soundtrack Joe Buissink \"I'm taking credit for the music,\" declared Romijn, who put together eight playlists for the evening.

        "doc_1_text": "In February, Paris Hilton surprised and delighted fans with the news that her then-boyfriend, venture capitalist Carter Reum, had popped the question. Hilton and Reum, both 40, had been dating for a year before Reum proposed. And after months of anticipation, the couple tied the knot on November 11 at the estate of the bride\u2019s late grandfather Barron Hilton. While the affair boasted enough glamor to leave a lifetime of memories, the celebrations also continued throughout the weekend.  Hilton's wedding was well-documented on her Instagram feed, where she shared over a dozen photographs from her nuptials\u2014plus a teaser clip from her new Peacock series, Paris in Love, where we see Reum take a knee on the beach and ask for Hilton's hand in marriage. \u201cYou\u2019re the first man I\u2019ve opened my heart to and shown who the \u201cReal\u201d Paris is. I\u2019m so excited to share our most beautiful love story,\u201d she wrote.  Below, find everything we know about the wedding.  The Engagement Ring  When Reum proposed, he did so with a stunning ring designed by Jean Dousset, the great-grandson of Louis Cartier. The rock's design was inspired by classic and Art Nouveau aesthetics, as well as the vaulted glass ceiling of the Grand Palais. Want to learn more? Hilton shared a YouTube video for just that purpose.  The proposal itself, per Hilton, was equally stunning. \"As we walked to dinner along the beach, Carter led us to a cabana adorned with flowers and dropped to one knee. \ud83d\udc8d I said yes, yes to forever \u2764\ufe0f There\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather spend forever with,\" she wrote on Instagram.  The Bachelorette Party  Hilton and Reum went the unconventional route for their bachelorette and bachelor parties, combining the two into one big bash in Las Vegas. Hilton shared a sweet video of the vacation-celebration on Instagram, writing \u201cI can\u2019t wait to marry you, my best friend,\u201d in the caption. It also looks like the couple has created two hashtags for their nuptials\u2014#ParisInLove and #HiltonReumForever\u2014an increasingly common choice for the modern-day couple.  The Bridal Shower  Everyone dreams of a fairytale-worthy love story, and Paris Hilton took that sentiment literally for her bridal shower. Less than a month before her wedding, Hilton\u2019s loved ones came together to throw the bride-to-be an Alice in Wonderland-inspired bridal shower. Her mother Kathy, sister Nicky, and friend Tina Chen Craig put on a party for the books, where guests could walk through Wonderland to celebrate Paris\u2014and perhaps the *magic* of love in general.    The Dress  Just a few weeks before the wedding, Paris Hilton\u2019s close friend Tina Chen Craig went live with Hilton on Instagram, where she revealed that she planned to wear 11 wedding dresses on her big day. \u201cIt\u2019s 11/11,\u201d the bride said of her wedding date, which is what led her to the number. While Hilton has only revealed a small glimpse into her nuptials on Instagram, a new 13-part wedding docuseries on Peacock, Paris in Love, promises an intimate look inside her wedding preparation and planning, leading up to the spectacular ceremony.

Jose Villa/Shutterstock  The series premiered on November 11 to correspond with the wedding, and newly-released photos show off two of Hilton's extravagant dresses\u2014both designed by Oscar de la Renta. The long sleeved gown, which Hilton wore down the aisle, features pressed flower thread work embroidery and a tulle ball skirt. The second, which she wore for the reception, is a Taffeta bustier cocktail dress with 3D floral embroidery. She accessorized the look with an array of dazzling diamonds, including a headband, necklace, earrings, and her show-stopping ring.  Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock  Nicky Hilton, Paris\u2019s sister and maid of honor, wore a custom alice +olivia by Stacey Bendet dress. The long-sleeved gown featured pink corded lace, a satin boned bustier, satin chiffon ruffles, and a satin bow with a train. The bridesmaids also wore dresses by alice +olivia.    Ahead of the wedding, Paris's mother Kathy Hilton shared one small detail about the gown. \u201cYou know how you are supposed to have something old? I am having something sewn into her wedding dress that's going to be a big surprise. I can't tell you yet, but it's going to be very special.\u201d  A sketch of the maid of honor gown, designed by alice + olivia by Stacey Bendet Courtesy of alice + olivia  The Guest List  Many of Hilton's family members, close pals, and celebrity friends were in attendance, including Emma Roberts, Kim Kardashian, and Demi Lovato, who sang \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d during the event.  Even if you didn\u2019t secure an invite to the wedding, there's still time to give a gift to the glamorous couple. There are a few items yet to be purchased from Hilton and Reum's registry, which includes everything from crystal glassware to Buccellati frames. The list is viewable (and shoppable!) to the public\u2014and the items included total nearly $66,000. You can view the registry here.  The Location  The wedding reception was held at the Bel-Air estate of Barron Hilton, the bride\u2019s late grandfather and the successor of hotelier Conrad Hilton.  According to Kathy Hilton, two special drinks were created based on the bride\u2019s iconic love of pink. \u201cWe're doing a special drink, Moet Rose Imperial Champagne,\u201d Kathy said in an interview just days before the wedding. \u201cAnd I wanted to have a little pink. Paris has to have a little pink in her wedding. So we're doing two special cocktails. One is going to have pink cotton candy with the champagne... I've seen it [before], I have to admit that,\u201d she says. But guests can expect a unique twist, Hilton said, noting that they added \u201ca couple of little secret touches to it, which gives it even a little more fizz.\u201d The drinks were served in glasses designed by Kathy herself.  The Afterparties  Prior to her wedding, Paris Hilton hinted at a multi-day extravaganza, and a multi-day extravaganza it was. Hilton and Reum kept the party going after they walked down the aisle on Thursday, hosting a carnival-themed party on Friday, followed by dinner and dancing on Saturday at the estate where they tied the knot.  Hilton and Reum took over the Santa Monica pier on Friday for a full night of candy-colored fun, which included carnival confections (funnel cakes, cotton candy), Paris Hilton-themed games (pinked-out ring toss), celebrity performances (DJ set by Diplo, anyone?), carnival rides (hello, Paris Wheel), and other glamorized attractions. The event was as Instagrammable as it gets, and Hilton was sure to document every moment.  On Saturday, guests reunited at Hilton\u2019s wedding venue\u2014Barron Hilton\u2019s former Bel Air estate\u2014for a formal dinner and a night dancing. Here\u2019s to hoping Friday\u2019s sugar rush didn\u2019t wear off just yet.",

The couple\u2014he's the younger brother of Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton Rothschild; she's a countess in Germany\u2014were both in St. Barths to ring in the new year. \"I\u2019ve been going to the island since I was a baby,\" Tessa says. \"My parents got married there in 1988, exactly 30 years ago. It has always been my happy place. I would have never imagined that one day the island would introduce me to the love of my life.\" But it did\u2014three days after the ball dropped to ring in 2016, Tessa and Barron ran into each other at a cabaret-style restaurant, Le Ti. \"Laying eyes on Barron for the first time was so surreal, like a dream,\" she recalls. The two connected\u2014amidst all the loud music, conversation, and dancing\u2014and at the end of the night, Barron took Tessa's hand and said, \"'You know when you just know?'\u201d  From that point on, Tessa and Barron were \"inseparable\"\u2014though they dated, moved cross-country as roommates, and made a run of it as \"friends\" before ultimately deciding they couldn't live without the other. \"During the summer of 2017, Barron and I had spent a good month and a half apart traveling on our own\u2014but when I returned to New York, he was awaiting me,\" she says. \"From that moment on, we could no longer leave each other\u2019s side. Two weeks later, he proposed.\" For the proposal, Barron planned a trip to Coney Island, a place they'd always talked about visiting but had never followed through on. But on September 17, 2017, they made it happen and hopped on a subway there in the late afternoon. \"Once we got onto the ferris wheel, Barron pulled out a letter he had written me while I was gone, recounting all of our memories together,\" she says. \"After doing a full circle on the wheel, he finished his letter, and I don't know how he could have possibly timed it so perfectly, but when we got to the top the second time, he got down on one knee, with a green, velvet box in his hand, and asked me to marry him.\" She, of course, said yes, repeatedly and with enough excitement to make their cart shake!  For their wedding, Tessa and Barron knew they wanted to head back to St. Barths, the place where they originally met, but worried about where they'd marry in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. (Thankfully, they visited in January and found the island to be more beautiful than ever.) \"Originally, we had planned on having our wedding on the beach but when we walked by the yellow Anglican Church in Gustavia our minds had changed,\" she says. \"The energy radiating from the 19th century stone building was mesmerizing.\" For the reception, they found a beautiful villa on the beach (their wedding planner, IB Charneau of Kiki-\u00e9 Mo Events, knew the owner!) and set about designing every single detail together. Keep reading for more!  Photo by Jenny Gorman  Photo by Robin Saidman  The bride worked with stylist Nilufer Satorius and the team at Watters to customize their \"Mihr\" gown. They gown is now named after Tessa, and it features long sheer sleeves an an A-line skirt. \"It was made with 25 yards of washed silk organza and 50 yards of tulle\u2014very voluminous but lightweight to easily move around,\" she explains. \"The bodice had custom hand beading that resembled pixie dust sprinkled along the cuff and tiny beads on the sleeves. It looked truly magical!\" Tessa's veil was custom-made by Toni Federici to coordinate with her stunning gown.  She accessorized with a pair of her grandmother's crystal earrings and carried a bright bouquet of peach, yellow, orange, and pink roses, peonies, and fuchsia celosia.

There, they took portraits, watched the sun set, and basked in their newlywed excitement.  Photo by Jenny Gorman  Cocktail hour kicked off while the bride and groom took pictures, but they made it back in time to join everyone for a locally-inspired dinner inside a tent on the villa's lawn. After three courses and numerous speeches, Barron surprised Tessa with a video that he'd made of their adventures together.

Of course, Ryan Seacrest dated the Dancing with the Stars pro Julianne Hough for 3 years, from 2010-2013 and there were rumors that Ryan was so in love that he planned to pop the question. Instead, it was reported that Ryan was left heartbroken when Julianne ended their relationship because she wasn\u2019t ready for marriage and that the couple\u2019s age difference (Ryan is 14 years older) also played a factor in their split.  Although Ryan Seacrest seems to have moved on, it still has to be awkward to be forced to talk about the wedding of an ex, and to have to do it on live television. But thanks to shady co-host, Kelly Ripa, Ryan had to do just that.  During Monday\u2019s Live! show, the co-hosts were supposed to discuss the weddings of both Julianne Hough and fellow Dancing With the Stars alum Peta Murgatroyd to Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who also married this weekend. Instead of letting Ryan talk about the wedding of Peta and Maksim, shady Kelly Ripa handed Ryan the picture of Julianne Hough\u2019s wedding, forcing him to comment on Julianne\u2019s wedding details.  Of course, Ryan Seacrest is a pro, so he congratulated the couple before adding that Julianne looked \u201cstunning\u201d in her wedding gown. Although he stumbled a bit when looking at a picture of the couple who married on a lake in Idaho, saying, \u201cI know this family. I\u2019ve been on this lake.\u201d Many viewers felt it was awkward for Ryan to announce that in the past he had been with Julianne Hough at the same lake where she chose to get married, but he was probably just caught off-guard at having to comment on her wedding at all.  Ryan recovered from the faux pas by saying to the happy couple, \u201cCongratulations. I wish them the best.\u201d But, Kelly Ripa was not about to let Ryan off the hook. She then bluntly asked him if it was weird for him to talk about his ex. Ryan assured her that it wasn\u2019t, but the whole exchange was filled with tension.  The fact that Kelly Ripa forced Ryan to talk about Julianne\u2019s wedding proves once again how difficult she is to work with. Now viewers are wondering how long Ryan will choose to stay at Live!

She was very cool, she was regular Meghan,\u201d the makeup artist shares. \u201cI think we were nervous, but we didn\u2019t want to make her nervous so it was very chilled.

        "doc_1_text": "They went back\u2026 back to the beginning. Mutual friends and birthdays were to thank the night NFL player Larry English met model Nicole Williams back in 2011. Though production cameras weren\u2019t around back then, the couple\u2019s relationship subsequently unfolded in the public eye on E!\u2019s WAGS, including their May 2016 engagement in Thailand. A year later, they married before 220 loved ones in Laguna Beach, California.  \u201cI was so happy and relieved,\u201d Williams, a model, tells The Knot. \u201cI was so nervous walking down that aisle I couldn't feel my legs\u2026 After months of planning and work, I could finally just enjoy the rest of the night.\u201d  The bride and groom, a retired NFL linebacker, thankfully tasked wedding planner Alissa Hussey with the finer details. \u201cI actually couldn't have done it without her. Planning a wedding is so much harder then I would have ever thought,\u201d Williams notes. \u201cSo much work goes into it. So many vendors and so many decisions have to be made. Having someone who knows how everything is supposed to flow really helped ease my stress.\u201d  FEATURED VIDEO FROM THE KNOT  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  The pre-wedding anxiety actually bubbled over to when she slept. \u201cI kept dreaming that I would arrive to the wedding and the whole venue was all pink and purple flowers. I\u2019d wake up sweating,\u201d she jokes. \u201cFlowers are the most important part of your wedding, so I literally would go to bed thinking about flowers and have nightmares that nothing would be beautiful\u2026 I had nothing to worry about and I was in great hands.\u201d  That doesn\u2019t mean that the day went by without any snafus. \u201cOne of my bridesmaids broke the zipper on her dress,\u201d Williams laughs. \u201cShe had to be stitched in.\u201d  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  In retrospect, the bride would tell herself to actually embrace each and every minute of the day. \u201cI would tell her to enjoy every moment because it goes by so fast,\u201d she says. \u201cI was told the same thing, even so, I still got a bit overwhelmed with saying hi to everyone, changing dresses, and being pulled in every direction for different things. Oh and take a moment for yourself to take everything in.\u201d  The Venue  The couple exchanged vows at the Montage in Laguna Beach. \u201cOur ceremony was set at the most perfect of locations, overlooking the Pacific Ocean,\u201d Williams says. \u201cLarry and I were framed together by a beautiful white and green floral arch that had roses and cascading orchids. Our aisle was aligned with black planter boxes filled with white flowers and even more tall floral arrangements at the entrance of the aisle.\u201d  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  The Dress  The bride wore a custom design by Michael Costello. The piece, comprised of lace and hand-beaded detail, included a high neck design and open back. \"It was my dream dress,\" says the bride.  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  The Ceremony  The couple\u2019s two nieces\u2014one on each side\u2014and goddaughter all served as flower girls in the wedding. The bride was escorted down the aisle by both her mom and dad to the tune of Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cThe Power of Love.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s always been a special song to me,\u201d she says.)  \u201cWe actually just kept our ceremony very short and simple. I didn't want to stand up there too long because I get so nervous in front of crowds!\u201d Williams says. \u201cYou wouldn't believe how weak my knees get.\u201d  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  (Photo credit: Duke Photography)  The Planner  Los Angeles-based event planner Alissa Hussey of Alissa Hussey Productions was a huge help to the couple. \"Having a big wedding like we did was definitely hard to pull off alone, so Alissa really made it happen for us,\u201d Williams says.

Fans posted videos to Twitter, and it was clear that she is a-okay with the world knowing she's with Joe.\n\nTaylor and Joe went back to the beginning, mutual friends and birthdays were to thank the night NFL player Larry English met model Nicole Williams back in 2011. Though production cameras weren\u2019t around back then, the couple\u2019s relationship subsequently unfolded in the public eye on E!\u2019s WAGS, including their May 2016 engagement in Thailand. A year later, they married before 220 loved ones in Laguna Beach, California.\n\nThe bride, a model, tells The Knot that she was so happy and relieved after months of planning and work. \u201cI was so nervous walking down that aisle I couldn't feel my legs\u2026 After months of planning and work, I could finally just enjoy the rest of the night.\u201d The couple thanked wedding planner Alissa Hussey for the finer details. \u201cI actually couldn't have done it without her. Planning a wedding is so much harder then I would have ever thought,\u201d Williams notes. \u201cSo much work goes into it. So many vendors and so many decisions have to be made. Having someone who knows how everything is supposed to flow really helped ease my stress.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, the bride would tell herself to actually embrace each and every minute of the day. \u201cI would tell her to enjoy every moment because it goes by so fast,\u201d she says. \u201cI was told the same thing, even so, I still got a bit overwhelmed with saying hi to everyone, changing dresses, and being pulled in every direction for different things. Oh and take a moment for yourself to take everything in.\u201d\n\nThe couple exchanged vows at the Montage in Laguna Beach. \u201cOur ceremony was set at the most perfect of locations, overlooking the Pacific Ocean,\u201d Williams says. \u201cLarry and I were framed together by a beautiful white and green floral arch that had roses and cascading orchids. Our aisle was aligned with black planter boxes filled with white flowers and even more tall floral arrangements at the entrance of the aisle.\u201d\n\nThe bride wore a custom design by Michael Costello. The piece, comprised of lace and hand-beaded detail, included a high neck design and open back. \"It was my dream dress,\" says the bride.\n\nThe couple\u2019s two nieces\u2014one on each side\u2014and goddaughter all served as flower girls in the wedding. The bride was escorted down the aisle by both her mom and dad to the tune of Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cThe Power of Love.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s always been a special song to me,\u201d she says.) \u201cWe actually just kept our ceremony very short and simple. I didn't want to stand up there too long because I get so nervous in front of crowds!\u201d Williams says. \u201cYou wouldn't believe how weak my knees get.\u201d\n\nThe pair opted for a white-and-black color reception. \u201cWe draped the ballroom in all white to create a crisp palette,\u201d she says. \u201cWe chose black, sparkly table linens and a huge white dance floor with our initials in black.\u201d To offset the neutral colors, Hussey added elements of sparkle with giant chandeliers over the dance floor. Adding to the luxe factor, the couple served meals on marble-canted chargers accented with rose-gold silverware.\n\n\u201cThe flowers were to die for,\u201d Williams continues. \u201cAvant Garden did huge tall round centerpieces of white orchards and roses held in massive black glass vases. White flowers were everywhere.\u201d\n\nBelladonna Sweets customized a seven-tier cake in white and rose-gold marble for the pair. \u201cI didn't eat at all because I was so busy having fun,\u201d says Williams. However, guests gave her the approval that it was truly delicious.\n\n\u201cLarry and I are huge fans of New Edition,\u201d she says. \u201cWe chose to dance to \u2018Can You Stand the Rain.\u2019 It's one of our favorite songs.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, Taylor Swift is turning 28 on Dec. 13 and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, has planned a surprise romantic dinner and an intimate night alone with her at a luxury hotel suite to help celebrate her birthday.

It\u2019s been nearly two years since the couple announced their engagement in August 2015 after a-year-and-a-half of dating, and the 28-year-old Dancing with the Stars judge and 33-year-old pro hockey player\u2019s upcoming nuptials are drawing closer.  Just one month after getting engaged to her fianc\u00e9, the blushing bride-to-be told PEOPLE, \u201cI\u2019m just feeling so happy and blessed every moment of every day. My favorite thing about being engaged is just a sense of warmth and just joy.\u201d  Here\u2019s everything we know about the couple\u2019s wedding.  Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic  They Can\u2019t Wait for Their Big Day  The countdown is on for their wedding, and the couple can\u2019t wait to tie the knot!  Hough gushed about Laich in a sweet lovey-dovey Instagram post in early June, calling him, \u201cMy best friend, my hero, my everything!\u201d She added: \u201cI am completely and utterly madly in love with you!\u201d  In celebration of his birthday in June, she shared two adorable throwback photos from her soon-to-be husband\u2019s birthday party, which was celebrated by the pool. \u201c#tbt celebrating this hunks birthday! @brookslaich \ud83d\udc99 That flame will never go out\u2026 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u201d Hough captioned a video that was captured at the celebratory affair. She followed it up with an image of the engaged couple sharing a smooch: \u201c#tbt Birthday kisses \ud83d\udc8b.\u201d  The NHL player also expressed his love for Hough (and their two pups!) recently. #wcw on these two angels!\u201d he captioned a photo of her cuddling up to one of the couple\u2019s beloved pups \u2014 Lexi \u2014 on a hike overlooking Los Angeles.  \u201cCouldn\u2019t get our other girl Harley out from the shade of the tree for the photo\u2026..I\u2019m a lucky man to be surrounded by love like this!!\u201d  There Will Be Lots of Dancing  One key element that will definitely be incorporated into the couple\u2019s big day is dancing.  \u201cOh my goodness, he wants more than anything to dance,\u201d Hough told PEOPLE in September 2015 about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s desire to show off his moves at the wedding. \u201cHe\u2019s always wanted to dance before he ever met me, so he\u2019s always asking me to teach him and I\u2019m like, \u2018Ask Derek!\u2019 I\u2019m just pawning my brother off to him. So I think Derek and Brooks might have a first dance. That would be interesting, and a sight to see for sure.\u201d  Speaking with PEOPLE Now in December, the DWTS judge said that Laich is keen on doing a choreographed first dance at the reception. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because he really wants to do a first dance. And that\u2019s more on him. Like, he wants to do it,\u201d said Hough. \u201cI was like, \u2018Of course I\u2019ll help you and teach you and we can do some stuff. But why don\u2019t you ask, like, Derek [Hough]. I mean, he\u2019s a dancer. He\u2019ll help you.\u2019 \u201d  That idea didn\u2019t sit well with Laich. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Why would I want Derek to teach me versus my fianc\u00e8e who\u2019s my best friend,\u2019 \u201d said Hough.  Speaking with Harry Connick Jr. in May, Hough dished on the choreographed number that they\u2019ll showcase at the reception.  \u201cI was always under the impression that we would just get up there and do a little side-to-side dancing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s like, \u2018No, I want a full-on choreographed routine!\u2019 \u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s always wanted to dance,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, well I\u2019m going to have to teach you, and you\u2019re going to have to listen.\u2019 \u201c  Music Is a Priority  Hough is hoping that her guests will be able to dance the night away to the tunes of one of her favorite musicians \u2014 and she\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes!  \u201cI\u2019m going to pull out all the favors,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight about getting Norwegian superstar DJ Kygo to perform. Hough said she\u2019s even open to reaching out to Selena Gomez, who recently collaborated with Kygo, to see if the singer is able to \u201cpull some strings\u201d in her favor!  And if big brother Derek could pull some strings, a certain singer would be performing at her big day.  \u201cYou know who I want to get? Michael Bubl\u00e9. I mean he won\u2019t. He can\u2019t possibly go, but it\u2019d be amazing if he just sort of rose from the ground and was like \u2018Hello!\u201d and started singing!\u201d Derek told PEOPLE Now in June.  It\u2019s a Pup-Friendly Affair  Hough\u2019s love for her two pups \u2014 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Lexi and Harley \u2014 is evident \u2014 and her wedding day will be no exception!  The two very special ladies will be included in her bridal party, according to the bride-to-be.  \u201cThey will definitely be running down the aisle at some point,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cFor sure, probably wearing little ribbons and bows, the whole nine yards. I haven\u2019t told Brooks yet, but that\u2019s happening.\u201d  They\u2019ll Be Surrounded by Close Friends & Family    Though Hough and Laich both compete and perform in front of millions of eyes on national TV, they\u2019re hoping for something much smaller when it comes to their wedding day.  Last June, she told PEOPLE that the magical night will include \u201cmainly just friends and family.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re keeping it pretty small and intimate,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them know each other, so it\u2019s perfect.\u201d  Big brother Derek Hough also hinted \u2014 shortly after the duo got engaged \u2014 at what he expects the big day to be like. \u201cSomething outdoors, in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cSentimental. Something special to us. I have an idea where it\u2019s going to be. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be amazing.\u201d  But even though they\u2019re aiming to keep attendees to only closest friends and family members, Hough admitted to Entertainment Tonight that it will still be a full guest list.  \u201cI have a really big family. Brooks has sort of a moderate-sized family, so regardless of how small we want it, it\u2019s still going to be big,\u201d she said.  FROM COINAGE: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars\u2018 Mirrorball Trophy  They\u2019ll Have an Epic Wedding Guest List  Hough and her beau may want to keep the celebration on the smaller side, but there\u2019s a few famous faces that we can almost guarantee will be in attendance.  In addition to her BFF Nina Dobrev \u2014 who documented Julianne\u2019s Mexico-set bachelorette party in early March on social media \u2014 we presume the former DWTS pro and current judge will most likely invite longtime friend and dancing pro Mark Ballas, actress Nikki Reed, Monique Lhuillier and Aaron and Lauren Paul.  She Wants to Look Like Herself  Hough will have all eyes on her when she\u2019s the brushing bride in white, but she definitely wants to look like herself when the big day arrives.  \u201cI want my wedding to feel glamorous, but timeless. And I think it goes from head to toe with your hair, your makeup, your dress and what you smell like,\u201d Hough told PEOPLE in December, who maintains she wants to \u201clook like me.\u201d  In addition to her hair and makeup, she aims to maintain her overall physical appearance as she prepares for her wedding day.  \u201cIf I get super hot for my wedding day and I\u2019m not afterwards, and I\u2019m not before, then it\u2019s like, \u2018Who is this person marrying my fianc\u00e9?\u2019 Or, \u2018Who\u2019s my fianc\u00e9 marrying?\u2019 \u201d Hough told PEOPLE in early March. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look different than what I look like normally.\u201d",

        "doc_2_text": "I\u2019ve never really been a ride-or-die fan of Anna Faris and Chris Pratt as a couple. I\u2019ve actually never been a true-blue fan of either separately. I\u2019ve read some of Anna\u2019s interviews where she seemed funny and \u201creal\u201d and interesting, but mostly I just kind of find her sad these days. I think she was more famous than Pratt when they got married, and now he\u2019s this big movie star and she\u2019s supposed to play the Rita Wilson role, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s comfortable with that. Plus, I believe some (but not all) of the rumors and blind items about them. I think Chris and Anna\u2019s marriage isn\u2019t all that. I think they love each other and they adore their son but they\u2019re one of those couples which\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I guess I just wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they announced their split tomorrow, you know? Their vibe is not one of happiness, despite the happy-couple act they performed on the red carpet of the Passengers premiere.  Speaking of the premiere, Anna told E! News that Chris had already given her a Christmas present \u2013 he upgraded her engagement ring. She told E!: \u201cHe just got me this ring. I know. Like two days ago. I look [at it] and I\u2019m like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe it either!\u2019 He\u2019s an incredibly romantic man and I\u2019m very, very lucky.\u201d Chris explained what Anna had gotten him for Christmas too: \u201cShe got me a tractor, so we\u2019re kind of even!\u201d You can see a half-decent shot of her huge new ring in this video.  It\u2019s beautiful. And huge. E! described it as a \u201cdiamond,\u201d but Anna doesn\u2019t say that and I\u2019m not so sure? Maybe it was just the light or the reflection off her dress, but it looks like a colored stone to me? It looks like a pale amethyst to me, but it could be a pink diamond. But if Pratt bought her a pink diamond that big, he probably shelled out mid-seven figures for it. And her original engagement ring was a decent size and cut too! This is a good shot of her original engagement ring back in 2015:  Perfectly pretty. Of course, jewelry is always nice, and who would say no to a huge new sparkly ring? Chris and Anna sure want you to believe that they\u2019re totally fine. But did her face say \u201cwe\u2019re totally fine\u201d in that interview? Does Chris\u2019s face say \u201cwe\u2019re totally fine\u201d in these photos?",
        "generated_text": "Anna Faris and Chris Pratt: A Love Affair with Rumors and a Big Ring\n\nAnna Faris and Chris Pratt have been a couple for several years now, but the question of whether they are truly happy together has been a topic of discussion among fans. While some rumors suggest otherwise, the couple has consistently denied any rumors of a split. However, their recent engagement ring upgrade and Chris' desire to have a big wedding dance might suggest otherwise.\n\nIn an interview with E! News, Anna talked about Chris upgrading her engagement ring, saying, \"He just got me this ring. I know. Like two days ago. I look [at it] and I'm like, 'I can't believe it either!'\" While Anna didn't specify what kind of ring it was, fans speculate that it might be a pink diamond, which would be worth a lot of money.\n\nHowever, Anna's original engagement ring was a decent size and cut, suggesting that Chris might not have spent that much on it. Some fans believe that Anna's marriage to Chris is not all that it seems and that the couple might not be as happy as they appear to be.\n\nMeanwhile, Julianne Hough and Brooks Laich's wedding is on the horizon. The couple announced their engagement in August 2015 after a year and a half of dating and have been dating for nearly two years now. Hough recently gushed about Laich on Instagram, calling him her \"best friend, my hero, my everything!\"\n\nThe couple can't wait to tie the knot and has been counting down the days to their big day. In a sweet Instagram post, Hough called Laich her \"hero\" and expressed her love for him. She also shared throwback photos of the couple celebrating his birthday and shared a kiss between the two.\n\nOne key element that will be incorporated into the couple's big day is dancing. Hough told People that Laich wants to do a first dance at the wedding, and she is willing to help him. However, Laich doesn't want to let her brother, Derek Hough, teach him, which could be interesting.\n\nHough is hoping that her guests will be able to dance the night away to the tunes of one of her favorite musicians, and she's willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen. She even mentioned reaching out to Selena Gomez to see if the singer can \"pull some strings\" in her favor.\n\nIn addition to dancing, Hough and Laich are keeping the wedding small and intimate, with mainly just friends and family in attendance. However, they have hinted that the wedding will be outdoors and sentimental.\n\nOverall, it seems like Anna Faris and Chris Pratt are a loving couple, but their marriage is surrounded by rumors and speculations. Julianne Hough and Brooks Laich, on the other hand, seem to be very happy together and can't wait to get married.",

        "doc_2_text": "Surprise! In a year that has seen so many surprise engagements, it seems Blake Shelton, 42, and Gwen Stefani, 49, one-upped everyone by having a surprise wedding! The two got married in March, insiders tell Star magazine, and for the past six months, the two have kept their marriage a secret! The alleged wedding took place at Blake\u2019s Tishomingo, Oklahoma ranch, at a \u201csmall gazebo by the lake,\u201d where 45 friends and family members watched. \u201cIt was super intimate. Not even locals in Tish knew it was happening,\u201d an insider tells Star.  \u201cIt was the most perfect day,\u201d the source says. \u201cSimple and full of love. You could tell these two are soulmates. Blake shed a few tears during the ceremony \u2013 he\u2019s a big softy at heart.\u201d Gwent\u2019s dress was \u201ca gorgeous fitted pure white\u201d number \u201cIt was nothing over the top, just like the ceremony itself.\u201d Among the witnessed seeing these two reportedly get wed were Gwen\u2019s parents \u2013 Dennis and Patti \u2013 and her three kids, Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4. Supposedly, Blake had Gwen\u2019s family fly into Oklahoma\u2019s Durant airport, before they were ferried to his 2,000-acre hunting ranch.  Guests for this secret ceremony, according to Star, enjoyed a few days of hunting, fishing, and dirt bike riding in the lead-up to the nuptials. \u201cThere were cookouts and campfires, and Blake showed off his own herds of deer, antelope and wildebeests,\u201d the source says. \u201cAside from the custom-made gazebo and glamping facilities, everything else was done in house.\u201d The wedding \u201cwouldn\u2019t have cost them much more than $20,000,\u201d the source says, \u201cwhich is surprising, but that\u2019s the kind of low-key life they enjoy together.\u201d What\u2019s really a surprise is that Star reports Blake\u2019s ex, Miranda Lambert, 34, \u201ceven sent a congratulatory text when she heard the rumors! There\u2019s no hard feelings.\u201d  While the idea that 45 people have been able to keep Gwen and Blake\u2019s marriage a secret for half a year seems crazy, 2018 is the year where that kind of madness happens all the time. After all, Cardi B and Offset pulled of the same stunt. The couple was married in September 2017, one month before he \u201cproposed\u201d to her. The two were secretly married for nine months before Offset inadvertently let the cat out of the bad at the BET Awards by calling Cardi \u201cmy wife.\u201d So, along with that and all the surprise engagements \u2013 Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas \u2013 could Blake and Gwen really be married?",
        "generated_text": "In a surprise twist on the year's biggest celebrity news, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani shocked the world by getting married in March in a secret ceremony at Blake's Oklahoma ranch. The couple, who have been dating for two years, reportedly kept their marriage a secret for six months before the intimate ceremony.\n\nAccording to Star magazine, the wedding took place at a small gazebo by the lake on Blake's 2,000-acre hunting ranch, with 45 friends and family members in attendance. The ceremony was described as \"super intimate\" and \"not even locals in Tish knew it was happening.\"\n\nGwen's dress was a simple, fitted white number, and Blake shed a few tears during the ceremony. The wedding was estimated to have cost around $20,000, which is surprising given the couple's love for low-key living.\n\nAmong the guests were Gwen's parents and three children, as well as Blake's ex-wife, Miranda Lambert, who even sent a congratulatory text when she heard the rumors. Despite the secrecy, it seems the couple has managed to keep their marriage a secret for six months, a feat that has become more common in 2018 as celebrities such as Cardi B and Offset, Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson, and Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have all pulled off surprise weddings.\n\nMeanwhile, former figure skater Tara Lipinski found her happily ever after when she married sports producer Todd Kapostasy at a romantic ceremony in South Carolina. The couple, who have been dating for two years, exchanged vows in a 200-foot aisle in a Reem Acra gown with a 20-foot tulle skirt. Lipinski's bridesmaids wore floral head wreaths, and the flower girls clutched baskets made by Lipinski's mom.\n\nThe couple's guests included Bob and Jill Costas, Andrea Joyce, and Lipinski's figure skating friend Johnny Weir, who served as her \"bridesman.\" The wedding was described as having a decidedly Southern flair, with highlights including chicken and waffles two ways and local fish as the main course. The lush floral arrangements were designed by Jackson Durham Events, and Lipinski's vision for the wedding included a soft, romantic palette with touches of green and flowers.",

She\u2019s very happy to have their support.\u201d  Meghan will not have a traditional American-style bridal party \u2014 royal weddings usually have younger attendants who serve as page boys and bridesmaids.

Matt Dunham/AP/REX/Shutterstock  While it was speculated that she might have a maid of honor \u2014 as sister-in-law-to-be Kate Middleton did with her own sister, Pippa Middleton \u2014 Meghan has chosen to have her closest friends by her side on her big day in an unofficial capacity. So, who is a member of that inner circle?  Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney.

Casey Kelbaugh  Meghan and Lindsay Roth met as students at Northwestern University and have been friends for over a decade. \u201cWe\u2019re the kind of friends who can be 3,000 miles away and still be talking about or thinking the same thing, and even texting each other the same thing at the same time miles away,\u201d Roth told PEOPLE of her friendship with Markle in March 2017. Meghan was also Roth\u2019s own maid of honor a few years back.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images  Fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who was previously married to Alexander Gilkes, a friend of Harry\u2019s, is rumored to have been the mystery matchmaker who set up Meghan and Harry on a blind date in July 2016. (The other woman who reportedly might have introduced the pair is mutual friend Violet von Westenholz.) She first met Meghan at a lunch in Miami, and they quickly became fast friends. \u201cI love her to death,\u201d Nonoo told the Evening Standard. \u201cShe is the coolest girl in the world.\u201d  Priyanka Chopra and Meghan Markle. Meghan Markle/Instagram  Meghan\u2019s good friend, actress Priyanka Chopra, had already confirmed she wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid, but she is attending the wedding \u2014 and even admitted she hasn\u2019t found a dress yet! \u201cI\u2019m more stressed out about those little hats!

The 37-year-old posed the question to her 18 million followers on Monday, by uploading a poll onto her Twitter account.  She simply wrote: \u2018Should #TheSimpleLife return?\u2019 with a quick yes or no option for fans to divulge whether or not they would want to see the show back on their screens.  And who would have guessed that these five simple words were enough to send fans into meltdown as at the time of her poll, more than 80 per cent of the people who took part said yes.  The pair were reunited at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards in L.A. on Sunday (Picture: Fox)  One fan wrote: \u2018I\u2019d be so excited. How funny were they together.\u2019  While another added: \u2018Hell yessss!! I still live for this programme and will forever be one of my faves! A comeback would be EPIC.\u2019  Someone else replied: \u2018IS THAT EVEN A QUESTION!! OF COURSE.\u2019  Hilton starred in the reality show from 2003 to 2005 alongside her best bud Nicole Richie. However following a very public fall out, the final season saw Richie replaced by Kimberly Stewart.  However it looks like their differences have been put aside as the two were photographed together at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards on Sunday.  Paris has also revealed that Richie will be invited to her wedding (Picture: Fox)  Paris took to Twitter to share a snap of their reunion with the caption: \u2018Love you @ NicoleRichie No one could make me laugh like you do. # SimpleLifeReunion # SanaSa.\u2019  She has also confirmed that Richie will be invited to her wedding along with all of her other gals.  In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the bride-to-be said: \u2018All my girls will be invited. Right now, we\u2019re just picking out the dress and the location.  \u2018There\u2019s so much to plan so I just can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s a really exciting time for everyone.\u2019  Paris and her soon to be hubby Chris will be sparing no expense when it comes to their big day and the DJ wishes to wear a dress that looks like something pulled straight out of a Disney film.  She said: \u2018It\u2019s a lot of planning to do. Right now, we are just trying to figure out a date and a location and my dress. I definitely want it to be very magical.

Nicole Williams\u2019 new business venture  Canadian TV personality Nicole Williams has started a new collaborative venture with Forever 21 beauty product manufacturers. Nicole Williams had always been an avid fan and user of beauty products manufactured by Forever 21.  She used to use their coffee-based body scrubs three times a week. She found that it enhanced her skin glow. She found these products particularly useful during her wedding and Mexican honeymoon.  Talking about her routine with the skin exfoliation products, Nicole Williams revealed to E! News:  \u201cI prepped my skin with the scrub two days leading up to my honeymoon. I made sure all of the dead skin was off, so my skin would be hydrated and glowing,\u201d  She added:  \u201cI also let the scrub sit on my face for five minutes before rinsing it off.\u201d  And the result was obvious. She looked prettier and glowing on her Playa del Carmen trip with her husband Larry English.  Nicole Williams disclosed:  \u201c[Body Blendz] contacted me and said \u2018We know you\u2019re obsessed with our products, would you want to create your own?'\u201d  Nicole Williams was, of course, excited about this offer. She enthusiastically asked the brand:  \u201cHow can we make this smell like a vacation?\u201d  The result was a collaborative effort and the emergence of the new coffee body scrub with a tropical twist called Body Blendz Mandarin Mist.  Nicole Williams\u2019 relationship with Larry English  Nicole Williams was dating former NFL player Larry English since 2013. Larry English and Nicole Williams had gone to Thailand in September 2016 as part of the E! Reality TV series.  It was here that Larry English had proposed to Nicole Williams in front of the rolling cameras. They got engaged soon after. Nicole Williams\u2019 engagement ring was a 6-carat planet-sized diamond ring.  Nicole told \u2018Stylish\u2019:  \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for four years, so this has been a dream of mine for a long time now. Larry loves to surprise me. I usually catch on when he\u2019s acting funny \u2026 but I never expected THIS!\u201d  The diamond ring was priced at $ 250000. It was learned that Larry English had helped in the design of the ring.  The diamond was set in an 18-carat rose gold and was surrounded by a diamond band studded with more than 100 stones.  Talking about her experience with such a heavy and costly ring, Nicole said:  \u201cI definitely have to get used to wearing a ring on this finger. Larry says I do this weird thing with my hand now. \u2018Well, it\u2019s heavy!\u2019 I said. But I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d  Nicole was ecstatic. She said:  \u201cI get to marry my best friend!\u201d  You may like to read Nicole Appleton welcomes a baby girl with Facebook executive Stephen Haines!

Brides-to-be Miley Cyrus, Miranda Kerr, Serena Williams, and more were not shy about flaunting their bling!  Not to sound totally shallow, but isn\u2019t the engagement ring just as important as the man giving it to you? In Sex & The City, Carrie Bradshaw actually THREW UP when she saw the hideous ring Aiden Shaw bought for her. That\u2019s not exactly the best way to start the next chapter in your life. Ergo, there\u2019s tons of pressure on dudes to buy the right diamond, the right cut, and the right band. Oh, and the right proposal plan. It may not be easy, but hunks like Liam Hemsworth, Evan Spiegel, and more totally nailed it with their girlfriends!  This year was FULL of romantic proposals! The Spectacular Now actor Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry, comedian Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salanger (this one was a little controversial considering his wife passed away less than a year before), Star Wars actress Felicity Jones and Charles Guard, and many more. 2017 also brought two famous exes back together after YEARS of being apart, and soon, they\u2019ll be headed down the alter. Of course we\u2019re talking Miley Cyrus and Liam! Love is officially alive and well again now that these two are back together and head over heels. The \u201cMalibu\u201d singer has been mum about a wedding date, but we hope it\u2019s in the near future!  While some engagements were to be expected, like Miranda Kerr and her CEO founder boyfriend, others were completely out of the blue! Lady Gaga is reportedly engaged to Christian Carino \u2014 and they\u2019ve only been dating for about six months! We have not seen a diamond ring from Mother Monster yet, but we can\u2019t wait to catch a first glimpse when she\u2019s ready to share the amazing news with fans. Another big congratulations goes out to reality star Cardi B and rapper Migos, whose engagement news broke just a week ago. So many beautiful weddings to look forward to!

        "doc_2_text": "Let me start here: To a lot of you, I think, I seem like the happiest person on the planet. I have an incredible husband\u2014John and I have been together for over 10 years. He has seen my successes and failures; I\u2019ve seen his. He has seen me at my worst, but I will say I don\u2019t think I have ever seen him at his. He\u2019s exactly as compassionate, patient, loving, and understanding as he seems. And I hate it. OK, I don\u2019t hate it. But it can certainly drive you nuts sometimes when you\u2019re as cynical as I am. If I weren\u2019t me, I would politely excuse myself to make the most epic eye roll of all time if a woman talked to me about her significant other the way I just did to you.  When John and I got together, I found my love for cooking. On one of our earliest dates, I took him to Daniel (four dollar signs on Yelp, ahhh!). I drank a $40 margarita, ate salmon rillettes (fancy salmon spread), and prayed my card wouldn\u2019t be declined. I couldn\u2019t afford to take him out to more dinners like that, so I started cooking more and more at home for us. I started with my own version of that salmon spread, then roasted whole branzino, osso buco, chipotle BBQ chicken. When my first cookbook came out, I finally felt proud of my work. I feel that same pride in Lip Sync Battle, where I get to work with LL Cool J and watch Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan go head-to-head as Beyonc\u00e9 and motherf-cking Paula Abdul. My job, essentially, is to have the best time humanly possible.  And a year ago, in April, John and I started our family together. We had our daughter, Luna, who is perfect. She is somehow exactly me, exactly John, and exactly herself. I adore her.  I had everything I needed to be happy. And yet, for much of the last year, I felt unhappy. What basically everyone around me\u2014but me\u2014knew up until December was this: I have postpartum depression. How can I feel this way when everything is so great? I\u2019ve had a hard time coming to terms with that, and I hesitated to even talk about this, as everything becomes such a \u201cthing.\u201d During pregnancy, what I thought were casual comments about IVF turned into headlines about me choosing the sex of my daughter. And I can already envision what will be said about me after this admission. But it\u2019s such a major part of my life and so, so many other women\u2019s lives. It would feel wrong to write anything else. So here goes.  I had such a wonderful, energetic pregnancy. Luna sat inside me like a little cross-legged Buddha facing toward my back for nine months. I never saw her face in a sonogram, just her butt or the back of her feet. Every time we kinnnnd of saw a nose, she would quickly dodge, and I was left guessing again. John, my mom, and my sister were all in the delivery room. John was DJ-ing. Luna, fittingly, popped out to the song \u201cSuperfly.\u201d The first lyric is \u201cDarkest of night. With the moon shining bright.\u201d I immediately put her on my chest. And she had a face! I was so happy. And exhausted.",

And exhausted.\n\nBeing a mom comes first, and anything that gets in the way of me being a good mom or wife, I simply say no. And that's true for so many women. Postpartum depression is a major issue that affects so many women, and it's important to talk about it and break the stigma surrounding it. So if you're a woman who's going through it, know that you're not alone. And if you're a friend or loved one who's going through it, be there for them and don't judge them. Just love them.\n\nAnd if you're a woman who's pregnant or thinking about having a baby, remember that pregnancy and childbirth can be a beautiful and empowering experience, but it can also be incredibly challenging. And if you're struggling, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are so many resources available, and there's no shame in asking for help.\n\nAnd finally, if you're a woman who's just had a baby, congratulations! Welcome to the most amazing, exhausting, and rewarding journey of your life. And if you're a man who's just had a baby, congratulations too! You didn't think it was possible, but you did it. And now you get to experience all the joy and exhaustion that comes with being a parent. So enjoy it, and know that you're doing the best job you can.

        "doc_1_text": "There are tons of joys of welcoming a baby into the world, no matter how many times you've done it. For country singer Jessie James Decker, breastfeeding is most definitely one of them. And that was true even when the going got a little, er... bloody. So, now that she's expecting her third child, Jessie James Decker reflected on breastfeeding in a conversation with E! News and spilled some serious deets. Despite how uncomfortable her experience sounds, her enthusiasm for the entire process will likely make you appreciate nursing just that much more.  Following the release of her latest album, Southern Girl City Lights, sat down with E! News co-host Carissa Culiner, who is also pregnant, and offered up some advice to the new mom-to-be. When the subject of breastfeeding came up, Decker, had a lot to say:  I love breastfeeding and you're gonna love it to. And when your nipples get really bloody, you know put a little Vaseline, you'll be fine.  But does breastfeeding really cause your nipples to bleed? Culiner wanted to know. \"Oh yes. Mine bled both times,\" Decker told her in the interview. \"I had some hungry little babies.\"  As she mentioned to Culiner, Decker has lots of experience with breastfeeding, as she is already mom to 3-year-old Vivianne Rose and 2-year-old Eric \"Buddy\" II, according to Us Weekly. She shares her kids with her husband, Tennessee Titans wide receiver Eric Decker. The couple also stars in the E! reality series Eric & Jessie: Game On.  And Decker got about as real as it gets talking about pregnancy and breastfeeding with E! News on Thursday, even revealing what she believes to to be a major pregnancy downside:  The worst part [of pregnancy] is finding clothes to fit because I don't think they have the cutest maternity clothes. And my boobs get so massive, like humungous, that nothing fits. I can't get anything to fit my body and it's so stressful. My back hurts, so that's tough.  Still, it's clear that she's pumped to have another one on the way. On Oct. 9, she announced the pregnancy on Instagram with a video of her telling Vivienne the big news.  \"... [W]e are over the moon and feel so blessed and can't wait to meet this little one end of march,\" she captioned the post in part.  According to BabyCenter, though, a woman's nipples should not bleed or crack if all is going well in breastfeeding. If they do, there are several possible causes: the baby's improper latch; something's wrong with the breast pump, such as the sucking level being too high; the baby's passing along thrush to the mom; eczema; or the baby's being \"tongue-tied,\" which can be corrected with a simple surgery. BabyCenter recommends discussing the situation with a lactation consultant if you do experience nipple bleeding from breastfeeding.  Still, Decker told People in another interview that she's most looking forward to sharing the \"special bond\" of breastfeeding with her third child. She nursed both of her older kids for seven or eight months each, and wants to do so for even longer the third time around, she told the magazine.  It's a journey that her fans and moms alike would sure like to see documented on Eric & Jessie, if Decker is up for that, of course. If not, good luck to her in beating her previous impressive breastfeeding duration records. It's not an easy task, and Decker's obvious enthusiasm for it is pretty cool.

Decker, who is already mom to two young children, has breastfed both of them for several months and plans to do so again with her third child.

        "doc_1_text": "Rihanna has earned a reputation as the de facto queen of the Met Gala red carpet with a knack for nailing the year\u2019s theme. Though, it wasn\u2019t always that way. First attending the event back in 2007, Rihanna was always well-dressed, but it took a few more go-arounds on the famed museum steps for her emerge as an ascended master of Met Gala dressing.  Her past Met Gala looks vary from a tailored suit in 2009, to a revealing Stella McCartney white two-piece gown in 2014. On the 2015 red carpet, Rihanna was undeniably one of the best dressed in attendance wearing a yellow Guo Pei gown with an insanely elaborate train and a matching headpiece that made headlines and maybe one of the most memorable MET Gala looks of all time. In 2017, she stole the show again in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Here is a look back at Rihanna at the Gala from 2007 to 2021.  2007: \u201cPoiret: King of Fashion\u201d Getty Images At 2007\u2019s MET Gala, \u201cPoiret: King of Fashion,\u201d Rihanna wore a white Georges Chakra gown with silver embellishments, paired with mesh gloves. She carried a red rose as an additional accessory.  Getty Images 2007 was Rihanna\u2019s first Met Gala, and one with a loser theme, so while it was a solid effort, clearly the best was yet to come.  2009: \u201cThe Model as Muse\u201d Getty Images Rihanna chose a Dolce & Gabbana suit and bow tie paired with black stilettos for 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Model as Muse\u201d Met Gala.  Getty Images The theme was all about the people that wear the clothes, rather than a central clothing theme itself. Still, Rihanna certainly made a statement with this menswear-inspired look.  2011: \u201cAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\u201d Getty Images Wearing a black lace Stella McCartney gown at the 2011 MET Gala, \u201cAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\u201d, Rihanna accessorized with a long side-braid and emerald earrings.  Getty Images It was another year where the exhibition theme was about a specific designer, which can be hard to channel when you\u2019re paired with another fashion house.  2012: \u201cSchiaparelli And Prada: Impossible Conversations\u201d Getty Images Rihanna wore a black Tom Ford gown in a crocodile-embelish texture in 2012. The theme was \u201cSchiaparelli And Prada: Impossible Conversations.\u201d  Getty Images She paired the look with a chic updo, accentuating the fact the side of her head was shaved at the time.  2014: \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion\u201d Getty Images Rihanna wore a white Stella McCartney two-piece for the 2014 edition, \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion.\u201d  Getty Images Clearly, she was ahead of the game when it came to wearing formal croptops.  2015: \u201cChina Through The Look Glass\u201d Getty Images 2015 was the year Rihanna began to really earn her reputation as the queen of dressing on theme. The exhibition that year was entitled \u201cChina Through The Looking Glass,\u201d and Rihanna wore a yellow gown designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei who said that \u201conly women who have the confidence of a queen could wear it.\u201d  Getty Images She accented the look with a headpiece fit for a queen.  2017: \u201cRei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art Of The In-Between\u201d Getty Images The \u201cavant-garde\u201d mandate of the 2017 red carpet for the \u201cRei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art Of The In-Between\u201d exhibition tripped up many, but Rihanna knew what to do. She was one of the few to actually wear Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, and arguably the one to pull it off best.  Getty Images The flower-inspired look may have eaten others up, but Rihanna remained the prettiest blossom in the bunch.  2019: \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\u201d Getty Images The theme in 2018 was \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\u201d so what did Rihanna do? She dressed as the pope. She tapped Maison Margiela designer John Galliano to create the look, though it was actually based on one he had designed for a man while he was at the helm of Dior.  Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Her beauty that night was simple, letting the outfit do the talking.  2021: \u201cIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion\u201d Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue Ok, so apparently Rihanna isn\u2019t always interested in nailing the theme. For the 2021 exhibition, \u201cIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion,\u201d she wore a look from Demna Gvasalia for Balenciaga. \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant and that\u2019s my take on American fashion,\u201d she said on the red carpet.  Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue 2021 marked a first for Rihanna. It was the first time she walked the red carpet with a romantic interest, current boyfriend A$AP Rocky.",

        "doc_2_text": "At 52 years old, it's not exactly surprising that Brad Pitt has gray hair, however, it is a little more surprising to learn that he dyed it that way \u2014 on purpose. On Sunday, the actor debuted gray hair while out in Paris, which caused a frenzy on the Interwebs. However, what we really want to know is why did Brad Pitt go gray?  It turns out that Brad Pitt is not turning into a silver fox, but is only playing a silver fox for a role in his upcoming Netflix Original film War Machine , where the father of six plays a U.S. Army general.  Generally, Pitt has brown locks, but I'm honestly curious as to whether he has to dye his hair to get his signature brown shade. My guess is he's got a handful of gray hairs, otherwise, he has some really good genes. OK, sorry, clearly Brad Pitt is blessed with good genetics, whether he has to dye his hair to keep if from naturally going gray.  Luckily for Pitt, gray hair has continued to remain trendy ever since Kylie Jenner rocked some long silver extensions in 2014, even though the gray hair trend has been making random appearances since 2007, and if you remember correctly from history class, silver hair was very popular during Marie Antoinette's era. Anyway, it's clear that Pitt looks good regardless of his hair color, so rock on.  Although I'm loving the new silver look, his natural brown hue is not too bad on the eyes.  Jason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Or when he let his hair grow out and the ends were a sun-kissed blonde...  Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  And then there was that time he went REALLY blonde (and still made it look good):  CARLO ALLEGRI/AFP/Getty Images  And then when he kept it short and natural-looking:  LUCY NICHOLSON/AFP/Getty Images  I mean, even when this happened he made it work:  LUCY NICHOLSON/AFP/Getty Images  Point is, whatever he decides to do, I'm behind him, 100 percent.

        "generated_text": "Brad Pitt, the silver fox, has graced the screens of many films and TV shows, but did you know that he dyed his hair gray for a role in his upcoming Netflix Original film, War Machine? Despite his natural brown hair, Pitt decided to go gray for the part, which has left many fans wondering why he would make such a drastic change.\n\nWhile Pitt's decision to go gray may have been a result of his desire to play a U.S. Army general, it could also be a result of his good genes. After all, Pitt has always been known for his stunning brown locks, which he has kept in check with regular hair dye.\n\nRegardless of the reason for his new look, one thing is clear: Pitt looks good no matter what color his hair is. From his long blonde locks to his sun-kissed blonde, Pitt has proven that he knows how to rock any hairstyle.\n\nIn addition to his love of changing his hair color, Pitt is also known for his love of fashion. He has been named one of the best dressed men in Hollywood multiple times, and has been called the \"de facto queen of the Met Gala red carpet\" for his ability to nail the event's theme.\n\nFrom his tailored suits to his elaborate gowns, Pitt has always been a fashion icon, and his ability to switch up his look for different roles is just one of the reasons he continues to be loved by fans around the world.\n\nSo, whether he's playing a U.S. Army general or just rocking a new look, Brad Pitt is always a sight to see. And with his good genes and love of fashion, it's clear that he will continue to be a style icon for years to come.",

If I wore an oversized shirt, I'd look like a sack of potatoes lmao,' one user commented.  Someone else questioned: 'How the literal HELL do you make this look good?' while another person asked, 'Are you ever not flawless?'  Grandchild: Zendaya shared that she went through her storage, found some of her grandpa's (pictured) old shirts and now we can expect 'cinched button up shirt dresses' from her  Stunning: One guy asked her if there's ever been a time where she didn't look flawless  Only Zendaya: One girl said that she would look like a used napkin if she tried to pull off the same look  Another quizzical person asked, 'How is it possible that you can turn literally anything into a photoshoot?'  'That's so cool! Vintage is an awesome look for anyone but you TOTALLY rock this look,' one enthusiastic girl commented.  Other people just couldn't get over how cute she looked and simply wrote: 'Wtf you're literally the cutest bye' as someone else said, 'Ugh queen of fashion.'  'You are a goddess even in an oversized shirt!' another admiring fan commented while someone replied, 'She can make a sheet look good.'  One user joked about Zendaya's newfound look writing, 'Prada and Gucci looking at this and changing their whole spring collections like.'  Some of the other comments from people simply stated: 'A thrifty queen,' 'Fashion icon,' and one hilarious comment read, 'I would look like a used napkin smh.'  'Z out here making trends since the day she was born,' one user commented on her amazing styling skills.  Old shirt: Another girl asked how it's possible that Zendaya looks great in an old shirt but the girl doesn't look nearly as good in a ballgown  Hard to pull off: A lot of the comments expressed how only Zendaya can wear an oversized shirt and look fabulous  Hilarious: One very confused and angered fan asked Zendaya how the 'literal hell' does she do it  Viral: While this user was quick to point out that Zendaya's outfit is probably going to trend on Twitter  Collaboration: She was just picked up in March by fast fashion retailer BooHoo to curate her very own collection, the Zendaya Edit (pictured at the collection launch in LA on March 21)  'Only Zendaya could pull of wearing clothes from a grandfather. Go off queen,' a proud fan wrote.  Another girl gushed, 'You manage to make everything look cool! And what a nice thing to wear your papa's shirts.'  Meanwhile, perhaps the star's biggest fan confessed: 'I aspire to reincarnate into Zendaya just for a day!'  Setting trends is nothing new for Zendaya who is known for her amazing fashion sense and brave style.  When it comes to red carpet looks or everyday outfits she always manages to pull off even the most bizarre ensembles.  Just recently the actress donned an outrageous suit for a Vanity Fair party back in the beginning of March.  She opted to wear an oversized colorful blazer with huge shoulder pads and matching color-blocked baggy pants but managed to look chic.  Plus, not only has her amazing style led to her creating her own clothing line - Daya By Zendaya, she was also just picked up by fast fashion retailer BooHoo for a collaboration.  The new collaboration with BooHoo is called the Zendaya Edit and she curated her very own spring collection with the brand which is available online.",

        "doc_2_text": "On Tuesday, Jennifer Lawrence wore a black Versace gown to a photo-call in London promoting her latest film, Red Sparrow. Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley\u2019s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.  \u201cI don\u2019t really know where to get started on this \u2018Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold\u2019 controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,\u201d she wrote on Wednesday. \u201cThat Versace dress was fabulous, you think I\u2019m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.\u201d  She continued to call the discussions \u201csexist,\u201d saying they were \u201ccreating silly distractions from real issues.\u201d  \u201cGet a grip people,\u201d she finished. \u201cEverything you see me wear is my choice.

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both \u201chot\u201d and \u201ctalented.\u201d  \u201cTimoth\u00e9e, I\u2019m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?\u201d she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. \u201c[I\u2019m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I\u2019m going to swing right in there as soon as he\u2019s, like, 30.\u201d",

        "doc_2_text": "It's almost meteorological. The funny thing about a backlash is the way it opens things up and builds momentum on its own. It's no coincidence that the metaphors we use for a backlash tend to be come from climactic phenomenon -- an opening of the floodgates, a turning of the tide, when it rains it pours. A backlash, though made by human beings, can feel like a part of the natural world and its inexorable forces. And that seems to be what's happening right now with Taylor Swift.  And while there are good things to say about Swift -- her pushing back against streaming services that shaft musicians, for instance -- this tide-turning comes not a moment too soon. I don't say this because I hate Taylor Swift or because I think she's talentless. It's because of the weird consensus that's shaped up around her in the last year or two: That she's a brave young woman who's earned it all herself, that she's \"just like us,\" that she should be lionized for her success at the game of self-branding, that she's a musical genius, that this scion of a multi-generational banking fortune is -- as the New York Times said of her not long ago -- some kind of \"underdog.\"  Despite this weird worship of wealth and power that's grown up in post-Great Recession America -- which has helped Swift immensely -- not everyone loves Swift or her oddly lifeless, machine-made music. But these critical voices have been marginalized. She's like the prom queen who drives the brand-new Mercedes to school, whose parents buy everyone cookies: If you defy her you are some kind of envious grouch or killjoy. Our job is simply to obey.  But the superstar's Twitter incident with Nicki Minaj -- spurred by MTV's Video Music Awards snubbing Minaj's \"Anaconda\" video -- has opened up a broader discussion about Swift's privilege and preening and phoniness, and it's about time. The Guardian has called Swift's response to Minaj -- she blamed it on men -- \"faux-feminist\" and \"tone deaf.\" The typically sober Atlantic charges Swift with \"uses the pretext of female solidarity to try and shut down [Minaj's] frustration with the music industry.\" (Minaj was complaining about the way black musician often get overlooked.)  And the press and media -- which has bowed to Swift's every move -- may be just getting started in this new direction. This is from a substantial new Gawker piece, \"Taylor Swift is Not Your Friend,\" which documents a lot of over-the-top blather praising her.  It\u2019s surprising to see smart people talk about Swift with such breathlessly positive overtures, not only because\u2014like pop stars before her and pop stars after her\u2014her music is simple and unfussy and infused with inane platitudes, but also because there appears to be something more opportunistic and sinister at play. When Taylor Swift does the mega-pop stardom act, she does it to the tilt. Swift has to be the person with the prettiest friends, the biggest records, the most popular and successful and groanworthily obvious boyfriend. The underdog narrative that the Swift machine has built is one of forced falsehoods; Swift is not coming from behind. She\u2019s been ahead since she started. And watching her collect best friends during a moment in history when womanhood is finally beginning to feel valued does not only feel uncomfortable\u2014it feels evil.  It's also hard not to find the ultraviolent \"Bad Blood\" video a bit, uh, bloodthirsty, especially given that much of her audience is young girls who may not be legally admitted to PG-13 movies. But Dayna Evans's Gawker piece says the video perfectly illustrates Swift's ruthlessness and feminist posing. \"Swift isn\u2019t here to help women\u2014she\u2019s here to make bank,\" she writes. \"Seeing her on stage cavorting with World Cup winners and supermodels was not a win for feminism, but a win for Taylor Swift. Her plan\u2014to be as famous and as rich as she can possibly be\u2014is working, and by using other women as tools of her self-promotion, she is distilling feminism for her own benefit.\"  So how far will this go? One thing we've learned lately is that Swift has very smart, savvy people working for her. She's a master of PR, and she could spin this all her way and go back to ordering us mortals to do her laundry and clear her table. But at least for now, we're enjoying a more honest, wide-ranging conversation about a figure who's been coddled for far too long.",

        "doc_2_text": "\u201cRoyal dress codes are very traditional, especially when the family member is carrying out royal duties,\u201d says Grant Harrold, a former butler in the House of Windsor.  Meghan Markle has more in common with Princess Diana than you might think  In tying the knot with Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson, she is also marrying into an institution where age-old traditions govern virtually all aspects of the royals\u2019 lives \u2013 including the clothes they wear.  As a sign of her new responsibilities, the 36-year-old has already closed her Instagram account, where she often posed in the sexy or dishevelled outfits befitting a TV celebrity \u2013 but not necessarily a royal spouse.  As she prepares to wed Prince Harry on May 19, the US former television actress is unlikely to be seen again in ripped jeans, hot pants or a plunging neckline.  Glamorous and elegant, Meghan Markle is set to freshen up the British royal family dress code, while tailoring her outfits to suit her new role.  The etiquette expert, who used to work for heir to the throne Prince Charles and his sons Princes William and Harry, says Markle could follow the example set by William\u2019s wife, the former Kate Middleton.  \u201cAs we have seen with the Duchess of Cambridge, hats are part of the royal dress code and it is likely that we will see Meghan Markle wearing hats more often,\u201d he says.  And the royal newcomer will also have to get used to wearing neutral-coloured tights, ditch any eccentric nail varnish and watch the hemlines.  \u201cThe outfits are more of a personal decision, but dresses should always be the correct length of on or below the knee, and never above,\u201d Harrold says.  The makeover is already under way.  At Harry\u2019s side at public events since their engagement was announced in November, her style has been one of refined elegance: long dresses, turtlenecks, classic coats and unflashy colours.  There have been some exceptions: black jeans here, bare legs there, but hardly enough to trigger a palace revolution.  After all, Markle has not yet married into \u201cthe firm\u201d \u2013 as royals call the family in private \u2013 and will still be learning the ropes as she goes along.  Passion for fashion A keen fashionista, Markle has long cultivated a casual Californian look that is a nod to her Los Angeles upbringing: comfortable in shorts and flip-flops.  But after landing a starring role in 2011 in the US legal drama Suits, where she played a senior paralegal, her look became symbolic of business chic.  \u201cThe fashion on \u2018Suits\u2019 is gorgeous, so it also became my education of designers and really knowing what fits my body well,\u201d Markle told outnet.com.  \u201cOn a normal day, I love a shift dress with flats and a little cropped jacket.  \u201cI would probably wear jeans, a nice top and a blazer.\u201d  She cites Emmanuelle Alt, the editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris magazine, and US actress Gwyneth Paltrow as her inspiration \u2013 two influential fashion figures whose outfits are studiously copied by their stylish fans.  Markle is \u201ca hint of Grace Kelly, a dose of Alicia Keys, a touch of Amal Clooney and a lot of Kate Middleton\u201d, says French magazine Madame Figaro.  Christine Ross, who edits the Meghan\u2019s Mirror blog, dedicated to Markle and her wardrobe, says the star\u2019s style is \u201cmodern and on-trend while still maintaining a classic elegance\u201d.  \u201cMeghan will definitely bring a youthful, vibrant change to the royal family,\u201d Ross says.  \u201cShe is very different from the other royals, being an American with a diverse upbringing, and this will naturally give her a different outlook.\u201d  Her wedding dress is a closely-guarded secret that will be kept until the day itself \u2013 and it could provide a hint about the sort of styles she might adopt once married into the royal family.  For several weeks, London has been bristling with rumours about who will design the dress, with names like Burberry, Ralph and Russo, Victoria Beckham, Roland Mouret, Erdem and Alexander McQueen swirling around.  On May 19 at Windsor Castle, the world will have its answer.  Want more stories like this? Sign up here. Follow STYLE on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter",

Fifty Shades Freed wastes zero time\u2014the final installment of the films based on E.L. James' (dominant) boy meets (virginal) girl story dives right in to the nuptials of Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). When we meet Ana this time around, she's wearing her wedding dress: a lace-and-tulle confection that cascades to the ground in an elegant train.  The woman responsible for the memorable dress is Monique Lhuillier, who also designed the silver slip dress Ana wore to the masquerade ball in the second film, Fifty Shades Darker. We talked to Lhuillier over the phone about whether we can get our hands on Ana's dress (yes), how long it takes to make (a really long time), and what underwear one wears under such a body-skimming garment (thongs!).  Universal Pictures  What was your starting point with the wedding dress?  I wanted to make sure it was iconic and very memorable, because once it's in a film it lives forever. So I wanted to create something traditional but with a modern twist, and really make sure it encompassed Anastasia's personality. I also wanted it to have the aesthetic of my collections, knowing the reason they came to me was showcasing my design aesthetic through the character.  How much attention do you pay to current trends when you are designing for a film?  I was fortunate to be given freedom with this dress\u2014[apart from basic details like] she's getting married in the scene, she likes long sleeves. But they were open to any ideas. So I sketched three options and chose fabrics and presented it to them\u2014they came back with the selection and that's how we ultimately landed on that dress.  Will people be able to buy this dress?  Yes, eventually. Right now it doesn't exist in the collection, but it 's something that we're open to once there's a demand for it.  Universal  How long did it take to make?  It was quite a short turnaround\u2014I would say from concept to the actual dress, maybe three months. The reason being that we had just finished the last details for the grey/silver dress, and they said, We'd love for you to do the wedding dress. So as I was finishing one, that was when the other task came. They filmed the movies back to back, so I had more time with the first dress than I did with the wedding dress.  How stressful!  But the thing is, that's what I do best. I have a factory here in Los Angeles, and we do everything from scratch here in-house. That's the beauty of it, I can make things quickly.  How long would it usually take to have a custom Monique Lhuillier dress made?  If you walked into my store and ordered something off the rack, it takes us six months to do that. When I work one-on-one with a client and design a custom dress from sketch to final fittings, we ask for 11 months.  Dakota Johnson (as Ana) wears Monique Lhuillier in Fifty Shades Darker Universal Pictures  Dakota Johnson said that she had some fittings for the dress. How did that go? Did she have any input?  Even going back to the first dress, it was an open dialog the entire time. We'd say, \"Let's raise the neckline a little bit for the grey dress, because [Ana] is more demure. We didn't want it to be too sexy. So we customized each look and each feeling at the beginning and tweak it as we went along.  The point of view for the [Darker] dress was a man selecting the dress for her, so it was more sleek and modern. We added the cape because we wanted more drama and movement when she walked into the masquerade ball. The wedding dress was more from her point of view\u2014selecting the dress of her dreams, reflecting what her personal style is, so we did less tweaking to that. Once the design was selected, we were just perfecting the fit. The design didn't change because it was clear from the start what we wanted to do.  What's the connection between your own collections and this wedding dress?  My dresses are always very feminine, elegant, modern. They're also traditional with a modern twist. Fabrications change, but you can usually tell a dress is a Monique dress when you see it. Usually my wedding dresses, I push and make them a little more fantasy, because this is when you can do that and shine. My ready to wear collections are a little more pared back. They're more fashion and a little more forward.  Universal Pictures  The wedding dress has an illusion back and clings closely to Ana's figure\u2014honestly, what kind of underwear can you wear underneath?  The reason I loved how this dress turned out is because it's very sensual and elegant, but it doesn't show too much. It leaves a lot to the imagination. The lace is very refined; it's cut close to the body, and I scooped the back and used a sheer lace overlay so you get the illusion of seeing more than you are. You can easily wear something like the with that and it'll work beautifully. No lines. I also paired the dress with a very elegant cathedral length veil, which is voluminous and has a lot of lace appliqu\u00e9s. I thought the balance of the grandiose veil with the slimmer silhouette of the gown was beautiful.  What fabrics did you use?  Mostly it's a chantilly lace from France. It's very lightweight and delicate, and it's something I use in most of my collections. It's a signature fabric of mine.  It continues down into the train, too.  We hand-appliqu\u00e9d a border all around the hemline, and that's lined with silk chiffon and a lot of sheer tulle. So there's a lot of structure in the dress, but you don't see it. It clings in the right places. My dresses are all very light\u2014even if they are very designed in the construction, it's really complex. And whenever you pick up the dress, it's very light and airy.  Universal Pictures  How long does it take to put something like this on, with all those buttons and such a close cut of the body? Is it difficult to get dressed?  It's not difficult\u2014you just need a little help, that's all.  You also designed some of the wedding looks for other characters, like Christian's mother Grace (Marcia Gay Harden) and Ana's friend Kate (Eloise Mumford). Can you tell me a bit about those outfits?  Those dresses were not designed specifically for them\u2014they were in the line already. The costume designer chose them and called me and said, \"I think you'll be so happy that it didn't just end with the wedding dress...these other characters are also wearing Monique.\" I was like, Oh my God, it's a Monique wedding! It's incredible. So I'm actually curious to see what they all end up with. I know they are wearing them, but I don't know which pieces they're wearing.  It'll be a nice surprise for you when you see the film.  Yes. I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Two months before I got the call, I said, You know what? I'm ready to do a film. I'm ready to do something that's on the big screen that lives forever. I've had dresses in films but they've all been purchased from my stores, I didn't really get that involved. I just put it out there. And it's a good one!  Fifty Shades Freed is in theaters now.  ",

But even in the writing phase, women must contend with Hollywood conventions that women on-screen must be likable or cleave to Madonna-whore-catfight stereotypes. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve had male executives say that my lead character was unlikable because she slept with a lot of guys,\u2019\u2019 says the director Julie Taymor. Liz Meriwether, the 34-year-old creator of Fox\u2019s \u2018\u2018New Girl,\u2019\u2019 says that before this show, she received notes from executives saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t understand how this character can be smart and sexy.\u2019\u2019  Female writers in Hollywood told me they are used to hearing things like \u2018\u2018Can you insert a rape scene here?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Can they go to a strip club here?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Can you rewrite the fat friend for Eva Mendes? She has high marks for foreign distribution.\u2019\u2019 They trade stories about how a schlubby male studio head mutters that he doesn\u2019t want to look at \u2018\u2018ugly actresses,\u2019\u2019 and how schlubby male directors, caught up in their fantasy world, choose one beautiful actress over another simply because she has a hair color that fits their customized sexual daydream. \u2018\u2018I still see storytelling for men by men that is always reinforcing the male gaze,\u2019\u2019 says Jill Soloway, the Emmy-winning creator of Amazon\u2019s \u2018\u2018Transparent,\u2019\u2019 which is based on her own parent, a trans woman played by Jeffrey Tambor.

        "generated_text": "Women who write their own material may have a better chance to direct it, but Hollywood conventions often limit their creative freedom. Female writers have reported receiving notes from executives suggesting that their lead characters should be likable or adhere to certain stereotypes. Studio heads have also been known to object to \"ugly actresses\" and make decisions based on personal preferences rather than the actress's acting abilities.\n\nJulie Taymor, director of the film \"Taymor,\" shared that she had male executives claim that her lead character was unlikable because she slept with a lot of guys. Liz Meriwether, creator of \"New Girl,\" stated that before the show, she received notes from executives saying, \"I don't understand how this character can be smart and sexy.\" These stories demonstrate the challenges that female writers face in Hollywood.\n\nFurthermore, Jill Soloway, creator of the Amazon show \"Transparent,\" pointed out that storytelling in Hollywood is often reinforcing the male gaze. Karyn Kusama, director of \"Girlfight\" and \"Jennifer's Body,\" lamented the fact that the No. 1 script motif she read was a woman chained to a wall. Lena Dunham, creator of \"Tiny Furniture,\" expressed her frustration at being offered film ideas that did not allow women to tell their own stories.\n\nDespite these challenges, there have been instances where female writers and directors have been recognized and celebrated for their work. Meryl Streep, for example, funded a writing lab for Hollywood's untouchable caste, women screenwriters over 40, after she won an Oscar for her role in the film \"Suffragette.\" Streep also acknowledged that it is harder for men to imagine themselves as the girl in the movies than it is for her to imagine herself as Daniel Craig bringing down the building.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hollywood conventions continue to limit the creative freedom of female writers and directors, there are also instances of recognition and celebration for their work.

In the photo, the Spider-Man: Homecoming actress wears a black-and-white feathered dress from Calvin Klein's most recent fall collection. Her make-up, done by the legendary Diane Kendal, showcases her flawless complexion and features a sultry, smoky eye and pinkish-nude lip - a look that somehow reads both timeless and fresh.  Hairstylist Shay Ashual pulled the Oakland native's strands back and gave her a set of faux, thick bangs, reinforcing a style that is well on its way to becoming the biggest trend of the season.  But even though Zendaya may look every inch the 2017 movie star in the magazine, in a video she created for the brand, the 20-year-old models the fashion and beauty looks that defined the past 100 years of American style.  She made it! Zendaya has landed on the cover of the biggest fashion magazine in the world at the age of 20. The Spider-Man: Homecoming actress looked glamorous in a black-and-white feathered Calvin Klein dress on the July cover of Vogue  The video, which has already racked up almost 50,000 views on YouTube in just a few hours, sees Zendaya dressed in nine different hair, make-up and wardrobe looks.  It doesn't specify which looks correspond with which time periods, which has caused some commenters to write that they were confused and 'got lost a few times'.  One said, 'The footage is amazing. The outfits are glorious but where oh where is a logic line to a video. When you title it a 100 Years of Beauty by VOGUE it should be something more than just smiles, sparkles and dancing and unstructured editing.'  1920s  Now showing: In a new video for Vogue.com, Zendaya dressed up in nine different hair, make-up and costume looks to portray 100 Years of Beauty  Who's that girl? The video began with the 1920s, where Zendaya was dressed a flapper with a fringed headpiece and bright red lipstick, courtesy of make-up artist Pat McGrath  The decades for some of the styles, like the one above of Zendaya dressed as a 1920s flapper with a fringed headpiece and bright red lipstick are easy to decipher.  Others, however, like the look below of Zendaya wearing a strapless ballgown, sunglasses, long black gloves, chandelier earrings and a satin bow headpiece seem to borrow trends from varying periods, making them harder to date.  Keeping in mind that fashion and beauty trends can be fluid, FEMAIL attempted to put the remainder of the looks in order below.  1940s-'50s  Breakfast at Tiffany's? The black satin gloves Zendaya wore in this scene gave off a distinct Audrey Hepburn vibe while the red lipstick and haristyle read more Marilyn Monroe  1950-'60s  Short hair, don't care: Although the bob has been popular since the 1920s, in 1965 Vidal Sassoon created a more angular, 'five-point' version similar to the one Zendaya wears here, though it's also possible that this look was inspired by the 1930s. The actress is wearing sepia-toned lipstick, a bias cut gown and what appears to be a cloche - all popular during the era  Getting Twiggy with it: Based on Zendaya's clumpy lower eyeslashes alone, one could guess this was a reference to the mod make-up popularized by supermodel Twiggy in the 1960s  Despite the fuzzy timeline, the overwhelming response to the video has been positive.  'This was not long enough! More Zendaya pleaseeee!' wrote one fan.  'Doesn't matter what decade the clothes are from, Zendaya can rock anything. She's beautiful and talented and true to herself. Who could ask more of her?' added another.  1970s  Did someone say Diana Ross? Everything in these photos from the red sequined dress to gold jewelry and voluminous curls screams '70s  1980s  Another unmistakable era: Zendaya may have shot this video in 2017, but she wears the over-the-top hair, make-up and clothes of the 1980s so well you would never know  She's in Vogue! Big, permed hair and blush that went from the cheeks to the temples epitomized '80s glam  1980s-'90s  Her blue period: Braids, berets and blue lipstick conjured images of the late '80s, early '90s  2000s  Paging Paris Hilton: Hoop earrings, massive Wildeside by Sama Eyewear sunglasses, a logo tee, lip gloss, and Starbucks drink and tiny dog in tow? Welcome to the early aughts, Zendaya  2010s  Athleisure for the win: Hoodies, fashion sneakers and a cellphone in hand are hallmarks of the model-off-duty trend of today  The Vogue video is far from the first time Zendaya has looked to other decades for her sartorial choices. She and long-time stylist Law Roach have collaborated on many referential looks in the past.  According to the Vogue interview, Law 'is known for an editorial approach to the red carpet\u2014he seeks to create characters\u2014and in Zendaya he has the ultimate chameleon.'  The story goes on to say: 'For instance, a month after David Bowie died, Zendaya attended the Grammys wearing a double-breasted tuxedo by Dsquared2 and a Ziggy Stardust\u2013inspired mullet.  'To convey how he persuades her to try a daring look, Zendaya adopts Roach\u2019s voice: \"It\u2019ll be a mo-ment,\" she says, drawing out the second syllable just as he does. This is one of Roach\u2019s bywords. Dreadlocks Goddess was a mo-ment. Intergalactic Cher was a mo-ment. There are other maxims, such as \"It\u2019s supposed to be polarizing\" and \"Everybody\u2019s not supposed to like it.\"  Is there a look she can't pull off? Zendaya works with stylist Law Roach to create red-carpet 'mo-ments', sometimes based on characters and usually boundary-pushing  Zendaya has been upfront about using different people and periods as inspiration. In a February 2016 article for Paper magazine, she interviewed Cher and told her: 'Well, it's crazy being on the phone with you, Cher, because my style has been so inspired by the things you've done in your career and the moments that you've had.  'There's literally been red carpets where I think, This is my Cher moment.  'I've dissected and looked at a lot of the things that you've done that I think were pretty groundbreaking, especially for women. So I'm super inspired by you. I think [fashion] is just girl power in a sense, and it's also about being inspired by past things and reinventing things.'

        "doc_1_text": "It simultaneously feels like Meghan Markle just began dating Prince Harry and as if she's always been a duchess. Her transition into royal life has been rather seamless, and yet a look back at her pre-Harry days reveals a very different persona. Meghan Markle's royal style is world's (or at least an ocean) away from what it used to be, and I've got the photos to prove it.  Markle's wedding to Prince Harry not only marked her official entry into a cushy royal life, in which she received her title, the Duchess of Sussex, but also a life full of new rules. The former Suits actress has always had a great sense of fashion, but as she is now legally related to the queen of England, Markle has to dress a little differently.  There is a long list of royal fashion rules that Markle is expected to follow, and she's been doing exactly that, but it's remarkable to see how differently she used to dress. One of the biggest changes that Markle has made in her fashion choices is that she dresses much more modestly than she used to. I\u2019ll be the first to say that Markle looks gorgeous no matter what, but take a look at some of her most un-royal looks from the past, and she how her style has evolved.  Boho Vibes  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a photo from January 2013, Markle shows off her days of hippie maxi dresses and a generally more casual style.  Charley Gallay/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  This look is from August 2010 and I suspect the queen would not approve of such casual footwear, let alone Markle carrying her own shopping bags. Royals are held to a very high standard and are expected to dress significantly more polished than this.  No More Cleavage  Amanda Edwards/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  As a non-royal, Markle wore some rather low-cut tops. A shirt she wore back in September 2009 even showed off a hint of bra! For most people, that's no big deal, but something tells me that a Duchess isn't allowed to show her undergarments.  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Markle looks fabulous here, but that dress is way too low cut for Queen Elizabeths' eyes.  Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  A menswear-inspired outfit from September 2014 is actually very polished, and I could see Markle wearing this look as a royal, but she'd definitely have to fasten a few more of those buttons.  Crop Tops Galore  Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Crop tops are v trendy right now, and Markle's been wearing them at least since 2013, but she's had to give them up now that she's with Prince Harry.  Mireya Acierto/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  This 2014 outfit would probably be queen-approved if only that top were a few inches longer.  The Short Of It All  Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  An overarching rule for the royal dress code is modesty, modesty, and more modesty, so this mini dress from 2013 would not make the cut.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Markle looks literally gorgeous here, but don't expect her to wear anything so short now that she's under the watchful eye of the queen.  All Black Everything  Cindy Ord/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Members of the royal family typically only wear black when in mourning, but Markle used to love her dark, monochromatic looks. This particular ensemble from 2013 even involved jeans, which are way to casual to wear in the queen's presence.  Monica Schipper/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  All black and a crop top? Good thing Markle got this out of her system in 2015, almost a year before she started dating Prince Harry.  I Present To You Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex  Chris Jackson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  What a difference a few years can make (and a royal husband). Markle's style has always been on fleek, it's just a little more polished now that she's royal AF.",

Getty Images  But as we learned from Vogue editor Anna Wintour on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" Amal wasn't done stunning us for the evening.  \"She wore this incredible dress on the red carpet that was designed by a young British designer called Richard Quinn but it was made of tin foil, so she was a little bit concerned it might rip during the evening,\" Wintour revealed.  Fortunately, the human rights lawyer had backup.  \"She went into the gift shop and she changed into this extraordinary Tom Ford dress, which is designed to look like stained glass,\" Wintour continued.  And it was a stunner as well: a full-length fitted mosaic maroon gown with matching red accessories, including Christian Louboutin heels. She sat at the table next to Rihanna, who took our breath away in her beaded gown.  Amal Clooney (with husband George) in her second Met Gala dress, a red Tom Ford creation that evoked stained glass.

        "generated_text": "Amal Clooney and Meghan Markle have both made significant style transformations since entering the public eye. While Clooney stunned in a shiny floral print gown at the 2018 Met Gala, Wintour revealed that she had a backup dress in case the first one ripped. Meanwhile, Markle's royal style has been more modest, with a focus on dressing appropriately for her new role as the Duchess of Sussex. One of the biggest changes she has made is dressing more modestly than she used to, giving up her casual hippie-inspired looks for a more polished and queen-approved style. Markle has also had to give up some of her more revealing fashion choices, such as low-cut tops and crop tops, and has toned down her love of all-black ensembles. While Markle's style may be more reserved now, she still manages to make a statement with her choice of designer and accessories. Overall, both Clooney and Markle have undergone significant style transformations, with Clooney transitioning from casual to glamorous and Markle moving from casual to more polished and queen-approved.",

        "doc_1_text": "Now in its seventh and final season, ABC\u2019s Scandal redefined the look of female power dressing in Washington, D.C., with Olivia Pope\u2019s powdery pastel pantsuits, statement coats and designer handbags inspiring fashion fans every week. So it\u2019s only fitting that the show\u2019s star, Kerry Washington, be honored with the Costume Designers Guild\u2019s Spotlight Award. Ahead of the 20th ceremony celebrating costume design in film and television (hosted by Gina Rodriguez), Washington talked about her collaboration with Scandal costume designer Lyn Elizabeth Paolo and how it felt to suit up in Anita Hill\u2019s iconic turquoise ensemble for HBO\u2019s Confirmation.  How does costume design help you as an actor?  It\u2019s such a vital part of the actor\u2019s toolbox. Your job is to create a complete person, and you can\u2019t do that without thinking about how that person walks in the world in terms of their appearance.  How did you work with Lyn Elizabeth Paolo to develop the Olivia Pope character?  For the most part, up until that moment in time in Washington, D.C., to be a powerful woman meant dressing like a man. We were conscious of not having Olivia do that, of having her not be afraid to bring her whole self into the room. That meant bringing her identity as a woman and her femininity and believing if she brought her full agency into the room, that it didn\u2019t disempower her. So we looked for clothes that had a waist, that didn\u2019t take away from my female form. And there were women in Washington at the time \u2014 like Michelle Obama and Desiree Rogers \u2014 who were developing this identity, women who were saying, \u201cI can be smart and fashion-forward, I can be brilliant and fabulous, and I\u2019m not going to leave any part of myself outside the room for your comfort.\u201d  What was the thinking behind her color palette?  A lot of people in Washington at the time were dressing in navy and black, again in order to fit into the male fashion aesthetic. We decided we\u2019re going to traffic in pastels and neutrals, not only because Olivia Pope is not afraid to stand out and write her own rules as an entrepreneur, but also because as a woman of color, I could pull off some of those colors in a different way that we hadn\u2019t seen on television, and we wanted to take advantage of that as well.  You\u2019ve said you trust Lyn. How has she helped you?  I remember in season one, episode six, it was an episode called \u201cThe Trail\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a defining episode in the series \u2014 and I remember being in a fitting, and I had something like 19 costume changes. I had never done anything like that. Being on a one-hour drama is a very athletic commitment, and even though I came to the show off of doing a Broadway show, so I was prepared for physicality, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the volume of material. I remember crying in the fitting with her, and she was also very emotional, and we just kind of looked at each other and said, we\u2019re gonna get through it and figure it out because we love this show and love this world. I really leaned into her belief that we could do it, and she was right.  What\u2019s your favorite Olivia Pope outfit of all time?  There are so many. I do often think about the very first state dinner we did on the show, which was that beautiful Calvin Klein sleek silhouette. I remember I had called the house to say we need that dress and they sent it right off the runway. Two things I\u2019ll never forget about doing the show with Lyn \u2014 one of them is that extra 15 minutes, which is when you\u2019re in the fitting and put the look together and you go, \u201cThat\u2019s OK.\u201d And I\u2019m so grateful to Lyn because what Lyn and I share is we look at each other and say, \u201cOK is not good enough.\u201d You push for the extra 15 minutes in fitting where it\u2019s a different shoe or sweater, or if we take in the waist just a bit, it\u2019s just that extra 15 minutes where you say \u201cOK is not good enough\u201d and you push for right. Even seven seasons later, we\u2019ll look in the mirror and say, \u201cThat works but it\u2019s not there yet.\u201d I\u2019m so grateful for that; that\u2019s what takes you from good to extraordinary. And then I remember between seasons two and three, Lyn and I went to New York during hiatus to meet with all the houses because of the volume of all the costume changes \u2014 we shoot before we air, so we wanted to make sure we were both utilizing all our relationships in fashion to get stuff early and fast and ahead of the curve. And so I was introducing her to my contacts and she was introducing me to hers and we were just sitting down with designers to say we know how important your work is to the life of the show.  Is there something about her work that brought into focus for you the demands of being a costume designer?  Absolutely. I\u2019m always exhausted after my fittings with her, and then she also has to dress 10 other characters; that always astounds me. And she treats every guest star as the lead of their own arc, and I always learn something about the character when the actor comes to set in whatever Lyn put them in because she has worked to help tell the story. And I remember season two or three, one of my husband\u2019s favorite shows is Shameless, and I said \u201cShe does that, too,\u201d and he couldn\u2019t believe it! Because you couldn\u2019t have two shows with a more different aesthetic, and she flawlessly lives in both those worlds.  In Django Unchained \u2014 how did the costumes help you get into that character?  The thing that costume does in that time period, especially \u2014 and I would argue the same is true today, but it was heightened in that period \u2014 is that it tells you everything about class. And class for a black woman in that period tells you everything about independence and agency. So it tells you a lot about what it\u2019s like to dress when you are property \u2014 the clothes that allow for freedom, and the clothes that allow you to be kept. And all women at the time, when you talk about corsets, were kept. I remember being in college, doing A Little Night Music, trying to sing in those corsets. Women fainted all the time because you can barely breathe. And so the systematic silencing and limiting of women was coming from the clothes. It wasn\u2019t just that women didn\u2019t have the vote, they literally weren\u2019t allowed to breathe to the same extent as men were. That\u2019s of course multiplied exponentially for a black woman. What we think of as beauty equals constraint, and to think about that through the ages is interesting.  In HBO\u2019s Confirmation, which depicted a woman in D.C. three decades before Olivia Pope, what was it like to wear a turquoise suit that was a replica of the one worn by Anita Hill?  I remember my breath leaving me \u2014 like gasping for breath when I saw it. Because I had watched hours and hours of footage of her in that suit and had spent so much time poring over pictures and video and audio recordings of that day. The suit really felt like armor. We even re-created the exact earrings and the exact necklace Anita had, and it all helped me to step into the truth of the moment.

However, this year the rapper won't be attending and instead will stay in Los Angeles with their two young children, while Kim attends with sisters Kylie and Kendall Jenner.  According to US reports, the reason Kanye is skipping this year's soiree is because he isn't yet ready to return to the spotlight following his breakdown and hospitalisation late last year.  A source told People magazine : \u201cIt had nothing to do with the Met Gala. It was more about the stress and pressure of a big red carpet. He just wasn\u2019t quite there yet.

        "doc_1_text": "Teen Vogue: grown-ish has definitely taken off and it was renewed for a second season, which is so exciting. How are you feeling about the show\u2019s popularity? Was this something you expected?  Michelle Cole: I\u2019m extremely proud of it. For me personally when I\u2019m doing a show at all \u2014 and I\u2019ve been doing this for about thirty-five years \u2014 I don\u2019t do a show thinking about what will happen next. I\u2019m always thinking, \u201cHow can I do my job?\u201d And I think that has worked well for me, as I\u2019m always giving it one hundred and twenty percent. Fortunately, most of the pilots I\u2019ve worked on have been picked up, but I do it because I enjoy it and I have a love for it. Even if this hadn\u2019t been picked up, I know it would have still looked great. When we were doing the pilot, we were under a little bit of pressure because we were shooting it in four days and we had a lot of setup. And we didn\u2019t quite know the show because we were trying to figure out characters. Every week, you\u2019re trying to develop your characters because every week you get that script that reveals them a little bit more. It\u2019s like dating. The exciting part is that I\u2019m unfolding these different layers of different characters. With Zoey, coming from her parents' home and going to college, we\u2019re seeing her blossom in front of us. When she was on black-ish, she had her other siblings that she was with, but we\u2019re getting to see her blossom on her own in this show. I\u2019m extremely proud of our hard work. Hair and makeup make me look great and I give them a huge shout out because they make the outfits look as I\u2019d like to call it \u201cmo\u2019 better\u201d. And Yara has a lot of input. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I know what I expected from me and my team.  TV: It\u2019s one of my favorite new shows, so I\u2019d say all your hard work has absolutely paid off.  MC: And that\u2019s the good part! It pretty much always pays off because whether it\u2019s good or bad, it\u2019s a learning process. Did we know it was going to be so big? Well, I think the best surprise is how successful it is.  TV: And what you said before about black-ish, how Zoey has grown up and that transition going off on her own at school, I\u2019m wondering how you approached that. She\u2019s definitely taking more style risks and it\u2019s noticeable, but it still feels like her. How are you approaching the different phases of her life?  MC: We did a lot of boards on each character and Yara does have a lot of input on how she feels. I\u2019ve also known her since the pilot, when she was fourteen years old. I\u2019ve seen in her own life and how she approaches style personally. When we see her take off to college in the first episode, she tells her father to get a life and that she\u2019s on her own. She hangs up on him and I think we see her start to take these risks. She\u2019s always had beautiful clothes and it\u2019s always been great fun to dress Zoey because she was already very stylish on black-ish. But here she\u2019s grown-up. She\u2019ll wear a robe with a Sade t-shirt underneath and then a scarf and big hoop earrings. We did take a bit more risks with a Gucci loafer and Zara PJ outfit, which was one of my favorites. I love that when she gets up in the morning that she doesn\u2019t really think about it: she just puts it on. She wears what she feels like wearing that day. She\u2019ll go from a sweater with a cotton blouse underneath to a fake fur, jeans, and some boots the next time we see her. We feature a lot of wonderful, big brand names, but it\u2019s more about her look and her style. We like mixing it up. Her risk is showing that she\u2019s growing up. When you see her in the first scenes of the show, she\u2019s trying on different tops when she\u2019s going to her night class. She ends up going with a sweatshirt.  We also start to see her in really cute dresses coming up. We\u2019ve started to show her legs and her shape in some of these outfits, which we didn\u2019t do on black-ish. She\u2019s in college, so that\u2019s a transition. Her mother is played by Tracee Ellis Ross, so come on. She dresses amazing on black-ish and is wearing all these great clothes as well, so of course she has style when she comes from two fashionable parents on the show. It\u2019s Zoey putting her own look together now. She doesn\u2019t have her parents: it\u2019s just her. And she depends on herself to get the right look.",

        "doc_1_text": "There\u2019s a good chance you never expected to Google: \u201cHow to remove a poop stain from [fill in the blank].\u201d That\u2019s because when you imagined having a baby or a pet, you probably didn\u2019t envision leaky diapers and dog accidents \u2014 or the need to clean poop out of carpet or off of your favorite work clothes. But here you are, and you need to know how to clean these things properly.  Getting rid of poop isn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s not hard, either. (Unless the poop isn\u2019t hard \u2026 then it\u2019s hard. Breastfed-baby poop, anyone?)  Start with the basics  Removing poop usually involves a two-step process. Here\u2019s what to do:  Cleaning.  Sanitizing or disinfecting.  Cleaning comes first because it\u2019s hard to disinfect something that hasn\u2019t been cleaned properly. This means getting rid of the bulk of the poop \u2014 whatever you can scrape off or otherwise remove \u2014 and washing the item or surface so that you can begin disinfecting (killing the germs).  But, should you wash the item with warm water or cold water? Depends. If it\u2019s a fabric that could potentially be stained, initially wash with cold water to avoid setting the stain. Warm water can be used if you\u2019re not worried about a permanent stain.  To quickly clean your basic fabric items (like a stained onesie that has those tell-tale yellow leaks streaking from the seams of the diaper area) follow these steps:  Remove as much of the poop as you can (and work as quickly as possible; cleaning immediately can minimize the potential for staining).  Rinse or soak with cold water (blotting helps).  Wash in the washing machine using hot water, an enzyme-based cleaner (if suitable for the fabric) and bleach or vinegar (if suitable for the fabric).  Learn to tackle stains on common fabrics and materials  Baby and pet poop can affect any manner of objects from upholstery and carpeting to bedding, silk items, wool sweaters, your baby\u2019s toys, your dog\u2019s bed and on and on. The precise methods of cleaning will depend on the object that\u2019s involved, so try these tricks for specific materials:  Cotton  Plastic  For baby toys and other plastic items, start with hot, soapy water and wash the affected item. Follow up by sanitizing or disinfecting (the Environmental Protection Agency offers a helpful PDF that explains proper procedure for sanitizing and disinfecting children\u2019s toys).  Rugs and carpeting  For your basic baby-poop-on-the-carpet event, clean with a combination of liquid dish soap, warm water and lots of blotting. Vinegar may prove helpful for stain-fighting. For a more complicated dog-poop-on-the-carpet event, a product called Nature\u2019s Miracle (an enzyme-based cleaner) may be effective at removing stains and odors.  Your hands  You\u2019ve washed your hands repeatedly, but they STILL smell like poop. (It\u2019s OK, we\u2019ve all been there.) Washing your hands with liquid dish soap may help, or trying wiping your hands with rubbing alcohol swabs.  Silk  The process of cleaning silk is similar to that of cleaning cotton except that you\u2019ll want to avoid enzyme-based cleaners. Sunshine is also recommended for stain removal on silk items.  Upholstery  Cleaning upholstery can be similar to cleaning carpeting although initially treating with cold water is preferable to warm water if you want to avoid setting stains. For machine-washable sofa covers, follow up by laundering. Nature\u2019s Miracle may also be effective in the case of pet poop on your furniture.  Wool  A cold-water soak is recommended for wool items. Then follow up with a thorough washing (avoid enzyme-based cleaners for wool products). Sunshine can be a good choice for removing stains from wool items.  Keep these items on hand  Paper towels  Perfect for cleaning and disinfecting \u2014 paper towels are a lifesaver.  Rubber gloves  Especially helpful when cleaning dog poop. Plastic gloves eliminate the chance of getting poop on your hands, which is aways a plus!  Patience  Removing stains takes time. Don\u2019t rush the process.  A sense of humor  Remember, this will be funny someday.  A garbage can  There will come a time (and you\u2019ll know when) that an item is simply too gross to save \u2014 not recommended for the disposal of sofas.

The best method for cleaning each object will depend on the specific material involved, so it's important to research the best cleaning methods for each type of item.\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning up after pets, it's important to keep in mind that patience is key. Removing stains takes time, so don't rush the process. It can also be helpful to keep a garbage can on hand for items that are too gross to be saved.

        "doc_2_text": "With all the hype surrounding Hollywood\u2019s recent awards shows, it appears the men of the red carpet have been the center of the A-Lister\u2019s gossip ring.  And no- it\u2019s not for looking handsome, or wearing that amazing Tom Ford tuxedo.  They\u2019re actually taking some heat for self tanning!  When I read that, my jaw dropped.  I (along with millions of other women) thought the bronzed studs such as Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney and Bradley Cooper, looked great.  For some reason, there seems to be a stigma surrounding men using self and spray tanners.  Since when is self tanning only for women?  I know many men who want to maintain some color without damaging their skin, and I\u2019m sure you do as well.  I for one, am more likely to notice a guy who has a nice tan going on, rather than one who is so white you can see his veins (although Edward Cullen may be the one exception).  When I see a man who is extremely pale, I think he looks sickly and that he spends too much time playing video games ;)  When a man has a a nice self tan (even if it\u2019s just a little), he tends to look healthier, and it also shows he takes pride in his appearance.  Men should be encouraged to use self tanners, it\u2019s a great alternative to tanning beds and/or laying in the sun (both which can lead to skin cancer and wrinkles).  There are also many self tanners out there that are specifically geared towards men. Big names such as Fake Bake and Anthony Logistics for Men have created tanners that cater to men!  Truth be told, both men and women can benefit from self tanning (not just Bradley Cooper).  By applying self tanner, you can automatically accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out your skin tone and even mask cellulite.  To me, it seems like a no-brainer to use one right before a national awards show. I\u2019m sorry, but no male (or person) should get ridiculed for trying to better their appearance.  This goes for all you women out there as well.  Now, I\u2019m not saying to over-do it.  You don\u2019t want to end up looking like a cast member from Jersey Shore. But a little color or sunkissed glow never hurt anyone.  Jessica Biel and Angelina Jolie both looked amazing at the 2014 Oscars, and do you know what they had in common? That\u2019s right, a tan!  There\u2019s nothing worse than seeing one of Hollywood\u2019s hottest bombshells blend in with her ivory/white dress.  Now, don\u2019t forget self tanning is not just for A-Listers, and it\u2019s definitely not just for red carpet events.  Maintaining your tan on an ongoing basis will help boost your confidence, not to mention make you more attractive to the opposite sex.  But most importantly, self tanning will save your skin.  You\u2019ll be thanking yourself years down the road when you avoided wrinkles from tanning beds, or even worse, skin cancer.  So overall, there aren\u2019t many downsides to self tanning.  Hey, if celebs like Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio are doing it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a try!

        "generated_text": "In the world of Hollywood, the recent awards shows have once again put the spotlight on the red carpet, and the men who grace them. However, this time around, it's not for their dashing good looks or their stunning tuxedos that they are being talked about, but for their self-tanners. Yes, you heard that right. Men are now taking heat for using self-tanners, a move that was once considered exclusive to women. But why is this so surprising? After all, isn't self-tanning a way to improve one's appearance and feel confident about oneself?\n\nThe stigma surrounding men using self-tanners is not just limited to the red carpet. Many men want to maintain a healthy glow without damaging their skin, but are hesitant to use self-tanners. After all, who wants to look like an orange-ish shade of brown? However, the truth is that self-tanning is not just for women, and it's not just for the red carpet. Men should be encouraged to use self-tanners as a great alternative to tanning beds and laying in the sun, both of which can lead to skin cancer and wrinkles.\n\nThere are many self-tanners available specifically for men, such as Fake Bake and Anthony Logistics for Men. These tanners not only provide a natural-looking tan but also help to accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out your skin tone, and even mask cellulite. And who says that men can't look good with a tan? Celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, and Bradley Cooper have all been spotted with a nice self-tan, and why shouldn't they? They look great, and so can you!\n\nSo, next time you see a man with a tan, don't be quick to judge him. You might just be looking at a healthier, happier, and more confident man. And who knows, you might even find yourself giving self-tanning a try.",

        "doc_1_text": "Taylor Swift's third video from her album Reputation offers an entire basket of easter eggs for die-hard fans, curious Swifties, and people who can fluently read Japanese. For those who aren't as eagle-eyed or bilingual, you can find most of Taylor's secret shout-outs here.  1. Taylor's Old Fashioned  Youtube  Taylor could be drinking anything in this shot from early in the video, but it looks suspiciously like the whiskey-based Old Fashioned drink she mentioned in \"Getaway Car,\" another song from Reputation.  2. Future's license plate says \"13\"  Youtube  Taylor has a long history with the number 13 and often includes it in her videos. Her birthday is on the 13th and she considers it her lucky number.  3. Kitty!  Youtube  It's no surprise that Taylor likes cats, but instead of including one of her two adorable furbabies in the video, this fuzzy friend pops up in the back of her lounging with a chair. The black cat might be a reference to black cats being \"bad luck,\" a sort of visual 13.  4. \"Ex-Love\" visual pun  Youtube  Right after Taylor sings \"I don't want to be just another ex-love,\" the camera cuts to this image of her sitting on a bench in front of a wall with wooden struts that look like the letter X. Gotta love an eye-pun.  5. Snake earring  Youtube  Taylor announced Reputation with short clips of snakes, indicating that she was leaning hard into the \"snake emoji\" image Kim Kardashian tagged her in during their whole thing. The snake earring in the \"End Game\" video is just one of the many snakey references.  6. Literally so many references hidden in the Japanese street signs.  Youtube  Twitter users have already started pointing out that the street signs in the Tokyo part of the video have the names of Taylor Swift's cats and some lyrics from the video hidden in them.  7. Another 13 and more snakes  Youtube  The boom box drops another 13 on us, and the snakey straws in the drinks are a nice touch.  8. An \"A Team\" shirt when she's sitting next to Ed Sheeran  Youtube  You can juuust make out that Taylor's shirt says \"A Team,\" and since she's next to her BFF Ed, it's definitely a reference to both the \"End Game\" and Ed Sheeran's song \"A Team.\"  9. This. Snake. Jumpsuit.  Youtube  Wait wait wait. This snake print jumpsuit is a snake reference, but it's actually the most brutal and specific reference in the video. In September 2017, makeup guru Jeffree Star threw his hat in the snake ring when he posted a tweet saying he was \"wearing Taylor Swift's skin,\" referring to his snake print jumpsuit.  Taylor is wearing the exact same jumpsuit! She is watching, ya'll.  10 & 11. Rainbow dress at a New Year's party  Youtube  The rainbow dress Taylor is wearing at the party is very similar but not exact to the rainbow dress she wore in the Reputation magazines released alongside her album. The dress in the video has a high neck and the one from the magazine is a v neck, but it seems like a pretty deliberate reference. Also, judging by the hats and fireworks, this is a New Year's party, which pertains to \"New Year's Day,\" another song on Reputation.  12. Special \"Endgame 13\" snake  Youtube  This single shot in the video combines Taylor playing a game with a snake, where she is on level 1-3, and the bar at the top gives her the option to \"ENDGAME.\" That's a lot of refs for two seconds on screen.  13. Joe Alwyn's necklace  Youtube  In the bathrobe scene, Taylor is wearing a robe, a necklace, and presumably little else. The necklace she's wearing is the same one she was spotted wearing when she started dating Joe Alwyn; it's a Tiffany pendant with the letter \"J.\"  14. \"Wildest Dreams\" car ride  Youtube  The shot of Taylor looking out of a car in the rain has the same lighting and composition of a similar shot from the \"Wildest Dreams\" music video. In \"Wildest Dreams,\" Taylor is sad and glammed up, with diamonds and red lipstick abound. This time she has a more natural look, and she turns to the camera and smiles. The \"Wildest Dreams\" video was also based on the doomed romances of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, which she references in Reputation's \"...Ready For It?\" when she sings \"he can be my jailer, Burton to my Taylor,\" presumably in reference to Joe Alwyn. Here's the \"Wildest Dreams\" shot for comparison:",

Though Taylor didn\u2019t use any names, it\u2019s easy to assume who she\u2019s talking about in the video.

The opening show took place in Glendale, Arizona, where the singer addressed bullying and her reptile theme. She explained that she hit a low point when someone called her a snake on social media. Despite this, she turned the scandal into a teachable moment with her fans. During the height of her feud with Kim Kardashian in 2016, the reality star dissed Swift on National Snake Day. Despite the criticism, Swifties in the arena cheered as she told her story of triumph over Kim the \u201cbully\u201d. However, Twitter sided with Kim, with some users calling Swift out for playing the \u201cvictim\u201d card. Despite this, Swift has numerous references to snakes in her album and video, as well as other easter eggs for fans to spot.",

        "doc_1_text": "Taylor Swift has made it clear she's not messing around with gossip anymore. Reputation is coming out on Nov. 10, at midnight, and the days leading up to the album's release have been packed with new content from Swift revealing things like the Reputation tracklist, behind-the-scenes videos highlighting the creation of the album, and now, the back covers of the Reputation magazines that are available at Target when you buy the album. And Taylor Swift's Reputation magazine covers prove she's trolling all of us with this album release.  On Wednesday, Nov. 8, Swift tweeted two photos that are apparently the back covers of the Reputation magazines that will be available come tomorrow, Nov. 10. Her tweet said,  Forgot to show the back of the Target magazines on Friday you can get your hands on this quality reading material.  The covers themselves say things like \"WHO IS OLIVIA'S REAL FATHER?\" and \"CATITUDE! MEREDITH IS OUT OF CONTROL!\" In case you didn't know, Olivia and Meredith are Swift's two cats named after Olivia Benson from Law & Order: SVU and Meredith Grey from Grey's Anatomy. This is expert trolling, if I do say so myself. The magazine covers show Swift making fun of tabloid coverage of her over the years while also making fun of herself. The magazines themselves will reportedly feature poems written by Swift as well as photos from her Reputation photo shoot.  I can't lie. They're pretty funny.  Swift is really going gung-ho with this whole \"F the media\" angle with Reputation.  Is this angle about the ~dishonest media~ pretty poorly/insensitively timed given the fact that the President of the United States actively tries to discredit one of the most important tenets of American democracy? One hundred percent. But look what we made her do!!  Swift's \"Call It What You Want\" lyrics highlight the emotional side of how done she is with tabloid gossip. The lyrics go:  My castle crumbled overnight, I brought a knife to a gunfight, they took the crown but it's alright. All the liars are calling me one, nobody's heard from me in months, I'm doing better than I ever was.  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream, walking with his head down, I'm the one he's walking to. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to. My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to.  All my flowers grew back as thorns, windows boarded back up after the storm, he built a fire just to keep me warm. All the drama queens taking swings, all the jokers dressing up as kings, they fade to nothing when I look at him.  And I know I make the same mistakes every time, bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right, I did one thing right. I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers, trust him like a brother, yeah you know I did one thing right. Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night.  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream, walking with his head down, I'm the one he's walking to. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to. My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to.  I want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck, not because he owns me, but 'cause he really knows me, which is more than they can say. I recall late November, holding my breath, slowly I said, \"You don't need to save me, but would you run away with me?\" \"Yes.\"  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream, walking with his head down, I'm the one he's walking to. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to. My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to.  Swift released the Reputation tracklist earlier this week, and it looks like the first half of the album is about her media reputation and the second half is about her relationship with Joe Alwyn.  Reputation comes out Friday, Nov. 10, at midnight.",

        "doc_2_text": "Kim Kardashian West hopped onto Snapchat to defend her husband Kanye West's honor tonight, posting a series of videos that prove Taylor Swift gave West permission to rap about her on infamous The Life of Pablo single \"Famous.\" (The line in question: \"For all my Southside niggas that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that bitch famous.\") Kardashian teased the reveal on Twitter earlier in the evening, and West's feud with Swift was the basis for one of the major plotlines on tonight's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  In the footage posted on Snapchat, West asks Swift for permission to use a version of the line over the phone from his studio. She gives her consent and thanks him for bringing the line to her before recording and releasing it. It's still unclear just how much Swift knew about the ultimate phrasing of the line, but it's obvious she agrees its sentiment is acceptable. (If you'd rather read than watch, The Fader has transcribed the footage. You'll miss legendary producer Rick Rubin hanging out on a couch in the background, though.)  Here is the entire conversation Taylor & Kanye had, judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/InTjvPGKe3 \u2014 ShadyPopMusic (@ShadyPopMusic) July 18, 2016  At the beginning of this year, Swift and West had almost entirely reconciled after he famously interrupted her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. That all changed when West released \"Famous\" and the rest of The Life of Pablo in February. Swift sent out a statement condemning the line and West's misogyny a few days after it was first played in public, and West used a series of tweets to claim that Swift had approved the line well before it was released. When she won the Grammy for Album of the Year a few days later, she used her speech to allude to unnamed enemies who \"will try to undercut your success.\" It was widely assumed she meant West.  When Kardashian appeared on the cover of GQ last month, she confirmed that Swift had approved the line and suggested that her conversation with West had been caught on camera, only to get blocked by Swift's legal team once they learned about its existence. It seems like the existence of a letter from Swift's attorney couldn't keep Kardashian silent forever, and now we're left to wait and see how Swift reacts to having the rug pulled out from under her. Between this and the Nils Sjoberg fiasco, she's had a pretty rough week.  Update July 18th, 12:20AM ET: Taylor Swift has responded to Kim Kardashian West's Snapchat with her own posts on Instagram and Twitter. The picture \u2014 a block of text claiming that West never played her the song or said he would call her \"that bitch\" \u2014 was captioned with \"That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.\" Swift says that the video falsely paints her as a liar, when she wasn't actually played the song, making Kim and Kanye's actions \"character assassination.\"  That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.

        "doc_1_text": "Taylor Swift released \"Call It What You Want\" at midnight tonight, her fourth Reputation single and her latest love song from the album. She also seemed to share footage of herself working on it that her current boyfriend Joe Alwyn possibly could've taken:  And, at first glance, the lyrics seem to say quite a bit about her relationship with her current boyfriend Alwyn and her recovery after 2016's Kimye Snapchat and Calvin Harris/Hiddleswift blowouts.  Swift has the sole writer credit on the track, so the single is likely at the very least inspired by her real-life experiences. And every word is packed with meaning. Here, the lyrics, with Joe Alwyn and Kimye references annotated, via Genius:  My castle crumbled overnight  Swift's 1989 final track, \"New Romantics,\" first referenced this metaphoric castle with the lyric, \"'Cause, baby, I could build a castle/Out of all the bricks they threw at me/And every day is like a battle/But every night with us is like a dream.\"  I brought a knife to a gunfight  The gunfight is likely a reference to the Snapchat receipts Kim Kardashian posted of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyric about her in \"Famous\". Swift posted a Note after on her Instagram, where she wrote: \"Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me 'that bitch' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.\" That was not enough to stop criticism of her because of it.    They took the crown but it's alright  All the liars are calling me one  Swift takes a pointed jab at Kimye here (as she wrote in her note after the Snapchats, \"Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.\")    Nobody's heard from me for months  Swift stayed out of the spotlight for much of 2017. Outlets ran pieces speculating where Taylor Swift went.    I'm doing better than I ever was  Chorus:  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream  Walking with his head down  I'm the one he's walking to  So call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to  Swift and her current boyfriend Joe Alwyn were first filmed together in October last year. News of their relationship, which they kept secret for months, wouldn't break until May 2017. Swift suggests here that Alwyn was her refuge during the fall, and she spent her time off recovering and falling in love.    My baby's fly like a jet stream  High above the whole scene  Alwyn is an up and coming British actor, while Swift's other boyfriends have been more famous and in the Hollywood/A-list world (Tom Hiddleston, Joe Jonas, Calvin Harris, and Harry Styles particularly.)    Loves me like I'm brand new  So call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to  Verse 2:  All my flowers grew back as thorns  Windows boarded up after the storm  He built a fire just to keep me warm  All the drama queens taking swings  Drama queens here could be a reference to Kim Kardashian and her other rival, Katy Perry, who talked extensively about Swift and their feud during her Witness press tour.    All the jokers dressing up as kings  Jokers could be a reference to Kanye West but also Calvin Harris, one of the world's highest paid DJs, and her other ex who caused quite a bit of drama for her in 2016.    They fade to nothing when I look at him  And I know I make the same mistakes every time  Bridges burn, I never learn  Swift is referring her to her dating track record and perhaps her most recent failed relationships with Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston (and the songs she wrote about them, like her other exes).    At least I did one thing right, I did one thing right  I'm laughing with my lover  Making forts under covers  Trust him like a brother  Swift and her own real brother Austin Swift are very close.    With Austin at a 2014 Golden Globes After Party Getty Images  Yeah, you know I did one thing right  Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night  Chorus:  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream  Walking with his head down  I'm the one he's walking to  So call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to  My baby's fly like a jet stream  High above the whole scene  Loves me like I'm brand new  So call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to  Bridge:  I want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck  Chain round my neck  Not because he owns me  But 'cause he really knows me  Fans on Genius point out that Swift has been photographed wearing a silver chain in her Reputation promo photo (and in the personal footage Swift shared with the release of \"Call It What You Want\"), one they think Alwyn gave her.  Note the silver necklace in all these photos. music.directv.com // Twitter  Swift previously wore a paper airplane necklace when she was dating Harry Styles that inspired song lyrics before, so there's precedent.  Which is more than they can say  I recall late November  Holding my breath, slowly I said \"you don't need to save me  But would you run away with me?\"  Yes  Late November is Swift's hint this is when they first seriously got together. \"Would you run away with me?\" could be a reference to their time spent undercover and privately in England when they first started dating.

        "doc_1_text": "Taylor Swift teased her upcoming sixth album, Reputation, with a series of three slinky clips of a slithering snake. It seems the artist is moving into a new era \u2014 and will be taking that snake motif along with her.  In a way, Swift has always been associated with snakes: she was born in 1989, the year of the snake by the Chinese zodiac, and even titled her last album 1989. But previously, the slithery symbol was not an association she claimed or wanted as part of her narrative.  Back in June 2016, Swift and DJ Calvin Harris ended their relationship in what seemed an amicable fashion. Soon after, Swift made it public that she had co-written the chart-topping hit \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d for Harris under a pseudonym. In response, Harris fans soon took to Twitter to start hitting Swift with snake emojis. Snakes are, in biblical mythology and contemporary shorthand, cunning creatures. Some of Swift\u2019s critics who felt the public reveal undermined Harris\u2019s own success used snakes to share their belief that she had serpentine qualities of her own.  Then in February 2016, Kanye West dropped his now-infamous rap song \u201cFamous\u201d off his album The Life of Pablo. One line, in particular, stood out: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b\u2014h famous,\u201d he sings. Up to that point, West and Swift had a fraught-turned-friendly history. While West had (notoriously) intercepted her win at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009, they had afterwards mended fences, even sharing dinner and expressing plans to collaborate.  But after \u201cFamous\u201d came out, Swift condemned the line as misogynistic and expressed that she was not privy to the use of her name in that context. For West\u2019s part, he said he had an \u201chour long convo with [Taylor] about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.\u201d  In June 2016, Kim Kardashian West further supported her husband\u2019s claim, telling GQ she had footage of a phone conversation in which Swift gave her approval to the lyric. And in July, Kim shared snippets of the taped audio of the phone call in question on her Snapchat story. Swift herself took to Instagram to respond, saying \u201cyou cannot \u2018approve\u2019 a song you haven\u2019t heard,\u201d and requested. to be \u201cexcluded from this narrative.\u201d  The internet erupted into a frenzy. Coined the #KimExposedTaylorParty, Swift once again was bombarded with snake emojis. Feeding the fray, Kim even tweeted (obliquely) about \u201cNational Snake Day\u201d in a seeming reference to Swift.  Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d \u2014 Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) July 17, 2016  The snake emojis disappeared soon enough from Swift\u2019s profiles. (Her Instagram account was the platform\u2019s first test case of a filter to remove select words or emojis on certain feeds.)  Swift also began a year-long period of limited public appearances and social media withdrawal, all culminating in the deletion of content off her digital presence last week, the reclamation of the snake imagery (and reinsertion of herself into that narrative) this week and the final announcement of Reputation on Wednesday.  Her first single is expected to drop Thursday at midnight. It\u2019s unclear what role snakes will play in her next steps.",

Swift decided to forgo her once-beloved Independence Day party for the second year in a row, instead celebrating America's 242nd birthday by splashing around in the ocean with her British beau.  The 28-year-old Reputation artist still managed to show her patriotic side in a red, white, and blue stripped two-piece bikini while swimming and snorkeling with the 27-year-old actor.  The pair enjoyed the temperate climate and calm waters at a luxury resort in Turks and Caicos, where they made the most of their romantic vacation. They even got a little cozy in the surf as Swift rode on Alwyn's back through the idyllic blue waters.  SBMF / BACKGRID  The pair's cozy ocean romp was a rare public outing for the couple. Despite being romantically linked since last May, they've only been spotted out and about together a handful of times.  While the lovebirds enjoyed the quiet, romantic holiday in relative privacy, fans of the pop icon were left wondering if this marked the end of Swift's Fourth of July party tradition.  For years now, the singer and her squad of besties -- which included super models, singers, actress and social media stars -- all gathered at Swift's Rhode Island estate for FOMO-inducing festivities that included barbecues, fireworks, patriotic inflatable bouncy houses and more.  However, amid her prolonged break from the public eye in the months before Reputation's release in November -- as well as her highly publicized feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and taking heat for not being as vocal against President Donald Trump as some fans would have liked -- Swift also skipped last year's Fourth of July celebration.  As some fans have suggested, it's possible Swift -- like many celebrities -- simply hasn't felt like celebrating the patriotic holiday. Or maybe its because she has been gearing up for and then subsequently performing in her massive Reputation Stadium Tour, and simply hasn't had time or energy to throw together a massive party. Only Swift herself can answer those questions.  For more on Swift's epic Fourth of July celebrations of years' past, check out the video below.  RELATED CONTENT:",

Let the games begin!  In the anime-inspired visual, Taylor Swift plays with themes seen in sci-fi films such as Tron and Blade Runner as well as Ghost in the Shell, specifically Major Motoko\u2019s cyborg shell. A little bit of the video game franchise Final Fantasy, perhaps?  And the latest Joseph Kahn-directed footage even contains follow-up references originally made in the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video as well as her past music videos. (Proof that the old Taylor Swift is alive and well!)  1. Shout-outs to Boyfriend Joe Alwyn  Look closely in the opening scenes and you\u2019ll find the number 89 \u2013 a nod to her birth year and album title, 1989. And what\u2019s that 91 in yellow? It could be Alwyn\u2019s birth year: 1991.  After all, she does sing: \u201cKnew he was a killer/ First time that I saw him.\u201d Alwyn\u2019s first-ever movie was last year\u2019s Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk, in which he starred as a U.S. soldier stricken with PTSD after a deadly firefight during the Iraq war.  Another shout-out to Alwyn: The name \u201cJoseph\u201d is in Chinese calligraphy at 0:28. Or could it be for the director?  2. The Snake Is Back  Don\u2019t think the snake references are gone! Swift slyly included \u201cYear of the Snake\u201d (\u86c7\u5e74) in Chinese calligraphy seen in one of the alleyways (at 0:22).  Swift has been embracing the snake image and using it to promote her new music, most prominently in \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d with a CGI snake. In addition, she\u2019 is selling slithering merchandise in support of her upcoming Reputation album.  And remember her feud with Kim Kardashian West? The reality star previously banned commenters from using the snake emoji on her Instagram, and instead was flooded with the reptile in the comment sections.  3. Secret Messages Hiding on the Walls  The star sends messages to her Swifties with affirmations on the wall as well as her favorite number, 13.  There\u2019s even a reference to the latest single off of Reputation: \u201cGorgeous.\u201d  4. Breaking Free from the Media\u2019s Perception  The glass box that cyborg Taylor is trapped in could be how Swift sees herself against the media.  A possible meaning to the \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d music video: Taylor is the only person to defeat Taylor.  5. Calvin Harris  All those luminescent lightning bolts could be to refresh everyone\u2019s memory about her songwriting collaboration with ex-boyfriend Harris for the 2016 single with Rihanna \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d The lightning bolts are clear references to the single\u2019s cover art and the line, \u201clighting strikes every time you move\u201d and that color scheme is definitely similar.  And remember Nils Sj\u00f6berg? Swifties think the singer\u2019s cyborg (cy-berg) getup could possibly be a nod to the pseudonym Swift used for writing credit on \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d  Kahn also joked about the fake name on Twitter Thursday, writing: \u201cNils Sj\u00f6bot.\u201d  6. Old and New Taylor  Though in \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d it\u2019s clear that Swift is battling herself, there are references to her old music videos.  Swift has collaborated with Kahn for \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d and \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d Fans noticed similarities in some of the poses from \u201c\u2026Ready for It\u201d in two of Kahn\u2019s past Swift videos: \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d and \u201cBad Blood.\u201d  In addition, \u201cBad Blood\u201d and \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d both featured futuristic themes throughout the videos with similar choreography.  7. White Horse  Keeping with the theory that Swift has revisited many of her past music videos, the Grammy winner also features a white horse, a possible hint to her 2008 track \u201cWhite Horse\u201d off the Fearless album.  Also Swift rode a white stallion in her \u201cBlank Space\u201d video.  8. Gold Plane from \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d  Observant fans found in one scene, Swift stands on what resembles a platform that reads \u201cburn all the witches\u201d in spray paint that resembles the plane from the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video.  9. Makeup  Swift\u2019s makeup, specifically the winged eyeliner is very similar to that of her \u201cBlank Space\u201d character. And the red lipstick is back too!  Reputation drops Nov. 10 and is available for preorder now.",

The video features themes seen in sci-fi films such as Tron and Blade Runner as well as Ghost in the Shell, specifically Major Motoko's cyborg shell. The video also contains follow-up references originally made in her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video as well as her past music videos. For example, the number 89 is a nod to her birth year and album title, 1989, and the name \"Joseph\" is in Chinese calligraphy at 0:28.

Some argue that the references are too obscure and may only be meaningful to hardcore fans. However, regardless of whether or not the references are significant, one thing is clear - Taylor Swift is still making headlines and is a force to be reckoned with in the music industry.",

And, as this is a Taylor Swift music video, there was no shortage of easter eggs and hidden messages, some about Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn, others not. Swift was pretty active on Tumblr last night, confirming fan theories. Here, every one she has endorsed:  On the Video's Meaning  Swift found happiness at the end of the video\u2014it's visible on her face:      The only person who sees the real Swift is the guy she met at the end, presumably Joe Alwyn:  Swift's awkward dancing symbolizes her/your inability to act normal in front of a crush:  Swift's public image taking a hit was actually liberating:  On the Video's Easter Eggs  \"Track 5\" is sprayed on a column in the subway station. \"Delicate\" is the fifth track on Reputation.  There's a meaning behind Swift's blue dress. Swift endorsed the idea it's a nod to the \"Dancing With Our Hands Tied\" lyric, \"Deep blue, but you painted me golden,\" symbolizing the effect love has on her.  Swift gave the sexiest lyric of the song very interesting choreography:  Swift dancing in the rain in her blue dress is a literal call back to the lyric \"I don't know why but with you I'd dance / In a storm in my best dress\" from \"Fearless\":      Non-Taylor-Approved Notes  That the split Swift does on the car actually has history behind it. Swift originally couldn't do a split and explained in a 2016 interview that she worked on the skill every day for a year. \u201cI got it in my head that I couldn\u2019t do a split, and I was really upset about it,\" she said. \"And so I stretched every single day for a year until I could do a split. Somehow I feel better knowing that I can.\u201d On Tumblr, Swift liked several posts applauding her split.  YouTube  Joe's Deli appears to be a little easter egg nod to Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn. The sign comes up right before she enters the bar where she meets the guy who's presumably him.  Swift is wearing her snake ring (a nod to the snake emoji that became synonymous with her in the aftermath of the Kim Kardashian's Snapchat takedown). Right when she notices it, she becomes invisible, though you could arguably blame that on the magic note she was holding.  YouTube  YouTube  YouTube  While the dancing routine isn't identical to Gene Kelly's in Singing in the Rain, the sentiment is pretty similar, along with some of the frames:  YouTube      The graffiti on the walls behind her say \"Echoes of your footsteps\" (a \"Delicate\" lyric, where the full line is \"Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs\") and \"#5 Delicate.\"  YouTube  YouTube  The Golden Gopher, the bar Swift walks into, is a real bar in downtown Los Angeles. It could be one of the first places she and Alwyn hung out, or just where she shot that part of the video.  YouTube",

In the first verse, Swift sings that her \u201ccastle crumbled overnight,\u201d likely referencing her drama-filled 2015 that saw high-profile breakups with Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston and a reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.  \u201cAll the liars are calling me one / Nobody\u2019s heard from me for months / I\u2019m doing better than I ever was,\u201d she continues. After performing at a Super Bowl party in February, the star largely went under the radar for the rest of 2016 and secretly dated Alwyn for months before news of the relationship went public.  \u201cMy baby\u2019s fly like a jet stream/ High above the whole scene/ Loves me like I\u2019m brand new so call me what you want, yeah,\u201d the Grammy winner sings about her boyfriend.  \u201cI want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck, not because he owns me/ but \u2018cause he really knows me,\u201d Swift also sings.  While promoting the song on her social media accounts early Friday morning, Swift shared videos from her life over the last year.  Snapshots included her singing an acoustic version of the song, relaxing at her Rhode Island home, riding a horse, enjoying a bonfire, painting a watercolor, sipping on wine, hanging out with her mom\u2019s dog Kitty, recording new music and celebrating her birthday.  The Grammy winner, 27, teased the track Thursday morning on her Instagram account, posting select lyrics that immediately had fans speculating if it was a follow-up to her 2008 smash hit \u201cLove Story.\u201d  In \u201cLove Story,\u201d Swift sings: \u201cRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone / I\u2019ll be waiting, all that\u2019s left to do is run / You\u2019ll be the prince and I\u2019ll be the princess / It\u2019s a love story, baby just say yes.\u201d  And in \u201cCall It What You Want,\u201d Swift appears to reference those lyrics: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to save me \u2026 But would you run away with me? \u2026 Yes.\u201d  The entertainer also seems to reference her song \u201cClean\u201d off 1989, in which she sings \u201cWhen the flowers that we\u2019d grown together died of thirst.\u201d  In \u201cCall,\u201d Swift sings \u201cAll the flowers grew back as thorns / Windows boarded up after the storm / He built a fire just to keep me warm.\u201d  \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d marks the third love song Swift has released off Reputation. \u201c\u2026Ready for It\u201d and \u201cGorgeous\u201d are both reportedly about her relationship with boyfriend Joe Alwyn, whom she\u2019s been quietly dating for a year.

Like all Swift albums, though, fans will most likely care more about the words to these songs than the sonics.  So that's where we come in: We went ahead and scoured Swift's new album for all the Joe Alwyn, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston, and Kimye references\u2014and there are a ton of 'em. Swift isn't playing games this time around, and we love her for it. Dig in.  Joe Alwyn  \"Delicate\": This song is one of many odes to Alwyn on this album. She references his blue eyes (\"Damn, never seen that color blue\"), the women in England (\"Do the girls back home touch you like I do?\"), and the brevity of their relationship (\"Is it too soon to do this yet?\").  \"Dress\": \"Flashback to when you met me / Your buzz cut / And my hair bleached,\" Swift reveals toward the end of this song. Alwyn had a buzzcut while filming Billy Lynn's Halftime Walk, and Swift had bleached-blond hair for the first half of 2016. The \"gold tattoo\" reference could also be a nod to Alwyn's golden blond hair.  \"Don't Blame Me\": There's no specific references, but this entire song discusses how Swift's \"drug\" is her \"baby,\" so it's obvious who this is about.  \"King of My Heart\": The \"king\" in this song is not American, because Swift says she's his \"American queen.\" She also says this king \"fancies\" her, which is a British term. And we don't have to remind you that Alwyn is British.  \"Gorgeous\": \"Gorgeous\" is perhaps the most obvious tribute to Alwyn on the record. It includes lines explicitly referring to his accent (\"I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk\") and his eyes (\"Ocean blue eyes\").  \"...Ready for It?\": Our money's on this being yet another Alwyn song. The man on this track is \"younger than her exes\" (Alwyn is 26), and she references an \"island.\" (The U.K., where Alwyn lives, is an island.) Also, the concept of \"games\" comes up in this song, which might be a wink to Alwyn's movie Billy Lynn's Halftime Walk.",

        "doc_2_text": "Taylor Swift's \"Gorgeous\" is about her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, Swift confirmed to her fans, but a certain ex also makes a lyrical guest appearance. In the released song, the lyric is \"I've got a boyfriend/He's older than us/He's in the club doing I don't know what,\" which led some to believe the line was about Calvin Harris (DJ, who's 33) or Tom Hiddleston (British actor, 36, the last boyfriend Swift was with before getting with Alwyn; she dated Hiddleston immediately after Harris.)  But in a new behind-the-scenes, making of the song video that AT&T released today, Swift sings her original lyrics for the song. She toys with the \"I've got a boyfriend\" line for a bit, and, during one song-writing session, seems keen on this lyric, which leads into the \"You're so gorgeous\" chorus:  I\u2019ve got a boyfriend/he\u2019s older than us/I haven\u2019t seen him in a couple of months/I go through phases when it comes to love/I\u2019m nothing that you want, but I must say you're so gorgeous...  Watch it at the 3:00 mark:  At first glance, this could suggest the ex Swift is singing about is Harris; the two spent a lot of their relationship apart because of Swift touring for 1989 and Harris playing DJ gigs around the world. Swift went to the Met Gala, the night she and Hiddleston hit it off, alone.  But Swift dated Hiddleston right before being seen for the first time with Alwyn in October 2016. Hiddleswift first got together in June and lasted until September.  A lot of the time during their relationship, Hiddleston was in Australia shooting Thor: Ragnarok\u2014Swift even visited him over there and was spotted with the Thor cast at the movies\u2014after they had a pretty intense start.  Hiddleston and Swift arriving in Australia together in July 2017. Getty Images  At the time of the Hiddleswift split, a source told E! that Swift \"felt he wanted to take the relationship to be too public, and she was not happy about it and thought it was too much publicity.\" If this original \"Gorgeous\" lyric really is inspired by Hiddleston, it may have been that the flame the two had also burned out (perhaps Hiddleston's alleged thirst for publicity extinguished it), and Swift moved on.",

Swift has been open about her past relationships with Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston, and Joe Alwyn, and many of these references can be found in Reputation.\n\nOne of the most obvious references is \"Delicate,\" which seems to be about Alwyn.

The \"gold tattoo\" reference could be a nod to Alwyn's golden blond hair.\n\n\"Don't Blame Me\" is another song that could be about Alwyn. The song's theme of Swift's \"drug\" being her \"baby\" is obvious, and Alwyn is Swift's \"baby\" in the sense that he is her current boyfriend.

        "doc_1_text": "As with any project she's attached to, the premiere of Taylor Swift's \"Ready For It\" music video was preceded by heated anticipation, excited countdowns, and countless fan theories. The cyborg-showdown depicted in the three and a half-minute clip only unleashed more speculation concerning the \"hidden meanings\" she may or may not be folding into the work released during this Reputation era. (Why is \u201c8919\u201d written on the wall? Who are all of those robots? How many Joe Alwyn references are there, really?) All of these musings largely go back to how Swift presents herself because, on top of a new sound, she's got a brand-new aesthetic to go with it.  Amid all of the action in the \"Ready For It\" video, the implications of her Blade Runner-esque costume can be overlooked\u2014after all, she seemingly appeared nude in all the teasers for the clip, which obviously diverted the conversation slightly. But lo and behold, the futuristic storyline did provide some key fashion moments that indicate larger shift in how Swift uses clothing (or the lack thereof) to usher in the latest chapter of her career\u2014and, of course, how this all shapes her reputation.",

        "doc_2_text": "Ever since Taylor Swift vowed to stay out of the public eye, she\u2019s largely kept that promise. Well, her exact words were, \u201cAs far as I know I'm only doing one show in 2017, and as far as I know, this is that show,\u201d spoken during a pre-Super Bowl concert in February. So that\u2019s maybe less of a vow and more of a calendar update. Regardless. In October 2015 she ventured this thought: \"I think I should take some time off. I think people might need a break from me.\u201d And then, off-the-record, she told Kanye West in the infamous call tapes, \u201cI\u2019m like this close to overexposure.\u201d  Like many celebrities before her, Taylor recognized that it was possible to be too famous. But unlike many of them, she took action to fix it, and then actually kept her word.  Fourth of July came and went without her annual Rhode Island celebration, known colloquially as Taymerica. The only photos of the star released publicly since the February concert have been taken with new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, and they\u2019re grainy, as if taken with an incredibly long lens. (Unlike, say, the remarkably sharp paparazzi photos that first introduced Taylor and Tom Hiddleston to the world.) There\u2019s the one on a Nashville balcony and the one supposedly boarding her jet in the U.K. The only social media we\u2019ve seen from her is in service of her friends\u2019 music releases\u2014one Instagram for each, Selena Gomez, the sisters Haim, and Lorde, plus a small video shout-out to Russell Westbrook, this past N.B.A. season\u2019s M.V.P., and a word of support tweeted after the Manchester bombing.  So enamored were we with the idea that Swift has been acing the laying low directive that when a Splash News paparazzi claimed the singer was carried out of her Tribeca apartment in a big box, it didn\u2019t feel completely beyond the realm of possibility (the photo service since retracted the claim). And now, for further proof that Taylor Swift is still committed to giving the world a breather from Taylor Swift, compare what going to the gym in 2016 looks like to what going to the gym in 2017 looks like:  From left, by Raymond Hall/GC Images, by NCP/Star Max/GC Images, by Josiah Kamau/BuzzFoto, from Backgrid.  Swift is known for her creative paparazzi-avoidance tactics, like walking backward so they can\u2019t train their lens on her face. But all these hoodies and grainy photos just go to show that if the most famous people in the world don\u2019t wish to be seen, they won\u2019t be seen. Swift is no exception, and it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see her until she ready for us to see her\u2014with an album in tow.",

        "doc_1_text": "In August, Taylor Swift released a series of blurry, pseudo-artsy snakes on her social media. As fans struggled to find meaning in this serpentine imagery Swift upped the ante, sharing a promo image for her new album, Reputation\u2014a sultry, black and white portrait that managed to beautifully capture all the angst and font-play of a middle school computer class project. While Swift gets a solid B/B+ in graphic design, her ability to dominate the national conversation\u2014and in the midst of a solar eclipse, no less!\u2014is unparalleled. With some grainy reptile footage and a \u201cFake News\u201d narrative, Swift ushered in the next stage of her controversial career.  While Reputation isn\u2019t dropping until November, it feels like everything there is to say about TayTay has already been said. The new Taylor Swift era has been described as Trumpian, petty, self-aware, self-obsessed, aggressively bad, and not as good as Carly Rae Jepsen. Turns out, Taylor Swift doesn\u2019t need to actually put out good pop music to stay on top; her new strategy appears to be generating buzz through diss tracks and coded lyrics while padding her dream wedding fund with overpriced merch and corporate partnerships. Who needs to write a danceable chorus when you can just put your face on a bunch of UPS trucks? Delivering packages is the new delivering hits.  Take \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the first single off of Reputation, which effectively set the tone for Swift\u2019s new era. Musically, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is\u2026not good. But no one cares, since the track is chock full of not-so-subtle jabs at Swift\u2019s uber-famous enemies.  After listening to the song ten times and then once backwards combing for receipts, fans were invited to go further down the conspiracy rabbit hole with the Easter egg-heavy \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d music video. Like Arya Stark without rhythm, Swift brags that \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined.\u201d She bathes in a tub of diamonds (A dig at the Kim Kardashian jewel theft?), shades Kanye\u2019s \u201ctilted stage,\u201d and even gets a few insults in at the past iterations of Taylor Swift. While Swift\u2019s meta-commentary was clearly meant to show that she\u2019s in on the joke, it ends up underlining the pop star\u2019s lack of self-awareness. Laughing about your reputation for playing the victim isn\u2019t believable when you\u2019re still complaining about all the people who are mean to you. Releasing this diss track as her first single proved that Taylor Swift still sees herself as the injured party, despite the fact that she is quite literally on the attack.  Taylor Swift\u2019s failure to understand why people don\u2019t like Taylor Swift is also apparent in her latest music video, \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d The majority of the Joseph Kahn-directed joint is spent watching a cyborg Taylor Swift stare longingly at a second cyborg Taylor Swift, which sounds about right. The main message of the music video is that Taylor Swift knows that we think she\u2019s a robot; the second, subtler takeaway is that Taylor Swift definitely saw Ghost in the Shell. Unlike the genuinely clever \u201cBlank Space,\u201d Swift\u2019s seemingly satirical lyrics fall flat here, as she ineffectively straddles the line between a scary-sincere love song and a parody of a Taylor Swift single.  When Swift sings, \u201cYounger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so / I see nothing better, I keep him forever / Like a vendetta-ta,\u201d it seems obvious that she\u2019s mocking her reputation as a cold, ruthless serial monogamist with a Rhode Island basement full of future boyfriends. Then again, lyrics like, \u201cKnew I was a robber first time that he saw me / Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin\u2019 sorry / But if I\u2019m a thief, then he can join the heist, and / We\u2019ll move to an island, and / And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\u201d might actually be sincere. For all of her purported self-awareness, Swift is still writing corny lyrics about an interchangeable white boy who she\u2019ll probably break up with come Christmas. In other words, this is the same old Taylor Swift\u2014just with a higher visual effects budget.  Again, the video seems to be taking a good deal of visual cues from Ghost in the Shell, specifically Major Motoko\u2019s \u201cfull-body prosthesis\u201d\u2014which is fine since white people have already ruined that. A hooded, Hot Topic Taylor cyborg-struts through a gritty sci-fi garage, where she encounters her near-naked cyborg doppelg\u00e4nger. The two Taylors face off across an invisible barrier. At one point, a cyborg Taylor appears to be channeling her past selves, sitting on top of the white horse from Fearless and/or her \u201cBlank Space\u201d music video\u2014Taylor Swift\u2019s old horse can\u2019t come to the phone right now, \u2018cause it\u2019s a reanimated robot corpse.  The idea that the innocent, heartsick songstress from the Fearless era is now a ruthless cyborg girl on a creepy robot horse is very 2017. \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d is really just a music video for anyone who feels like a cold, hollowed-out shell of their former self, just going through the motions.  In the end, Taylor Swift (the naked robot) is the only one who\u2019s strong enough to defeat Taylor Swift (the robot with dramatic eyeliner). The moral of the story seems to be that no mere mortal can stop Taylor Swift and Joseph Kahn from slowly assembling a Lemonade-lite visual album (Minute Maid? Milk?). Time will only tell which Beyonc\u00e9 music video/Scarlett Johansson flop Swift will rip off next.",

Alwyn tries to attend her concert dates when he can, the source added.

And that outing was rare itself: Swift has only been photographed out with Alwyn a couple times and has never spoken about him besides in her songs.  Last August, a source told People that this whole keeping the relationship out of the press thing really works for her. \"Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy,\" the source said then. \"They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.\u201d  In People's new report today, its source also mentioned that Swift \u201chas a few days off for July 4th\u201d but gave no indication whether she'd throw the usual Taymerica party for her celeb friends at her Rhode Island estate.

        "doc_1_text": "Ahh, the snake emoji: It's become a piece of iconography and digital warfare for both Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian's seismic fan bases. Swift's critics were the first people to use it, of course. They dubbed her a \"snake\" in summer 2016 after Kardashian leaked a video of Kanye West and Swift discussing his song \"Famous.\" To recap, West included some pointed lyrics about Swift in the song, of which she said she didn't give her OK. But then Kardashian leaked audio that showed Swift seemingly approving the line where West says they had sex; Swift, however, says it was the \"that bitch\" line she didn't greenlight and had issues with. Who was right or wrong in this scenario is irrelevant. Swift's reputation took a hit as a result\u2014hence her new album\u2014and the general public branded her a liar.  After the incident Swift's social media feeds were quickly spammed with the snake emoji. But the singer reclaimed the image in 2017 when she released her song \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" It then became a source of power for Swift's fans\u2014and something they used against Kardashian. That's presumably why the reality star blocked the use of the emoji on her Instagram: The Swifties kept bombarding her with it.  And now the drama's continuing (groan) with a brand new emoji: the rat. Here's what's going on. I'm sure you all remember that West's \"Famous\" video included a naked wax figure of Swift. Well, Kardashian posted a throwback photo featuring the \"Famous\" image that included the Swift figure in it, and the pop star's fans were not pleased. They quickly started spamming Kardashian's Instagram with rat emojis because \"snakes eat rats.\"  Check out the photo in question, below:",

The video opens with a vacant-looking Swift on the red carpet, dressed in a flapper-inspired sapphire gown and mobbed by reporters and photographers.  She escapes to her dressing room, where the songstress makes funny faces at herself in the mirror. She\u2019s interrupted by a group of women, and when she turns back to the mirror, she realizes she can\u2019t see her reflection anymore.  This realization sets off a string of impromptu \u201cLa La Land\u201d-esque dance moves \u2014 some of which are painfully awkward to watch.  About a minute and a half in, things get crazy: The singer whips off the bottom of her gown, revealing a sassy, shorter version of her fringy frock.  The weird dance moves and the dramatic disrobing aren\u2019t even the most buzzed-about bits of the video, though.

And, Swift's fans claim she told them it's about her boyfriend Joe Alwyn during her Reputation Secret Sessions with them.  The lyrics describe how they met and she fell for him...when she was still dating someone else (Tom Hiddleston, perhaps?)  But the words, always open to interpretation, really speak for themselves. Here they are:  Intro  Gorgeous  Verse 1:  You should take it as a compliment  That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk  You should think about the consequence  Of your magnetic field being a little too strong  And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us  Swift's last boyfriend before 26-year-old actor Joe Alwyn was 36-year-old actor Tom Hiddleston. Swift and Hiddleston officially broke up in September 2016 (though a reconciliation rumor went around at the end of October last year.) While it's unclear when Swift and Alwyn officially first met and started dating, they were filmed leaving a private Kings of Leon concert together in October 2016. Swift went to the screening of Alwyn's film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk in November.  He's in the club doin' I don't know what  You're so cool it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)  Pre-Chorus:  Whiskey on ice, sunset and vine  You've ruined my life by not being mine  Chorus:  You're so gorgeous  I can't say anything to your face  'Cause look at your face  And I'm so furious  At you for making me feel this way  But what can I say?  You're gorgeous  Verse 2:  You should take it as a compliment  That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)  And you should think about the consequence  Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)  If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her  But if you're single that's honestly worse  'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts  (Honey, it hurts)  Pre-Chorus:  Ocean blue eyes looking in mine  I feel like I might sink and drown and die  Chorus:  You're so gorgeous  I can't say anything to your face (to your face)  'Cause look at your face (look at your face)  And I'm so furious  At you for making me feel this way (this way)  But what can I say?  You're gorgeous  Bridge:  You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah  There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have  You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad  You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah  There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have  Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats  Swift, of course, has two famous cats: Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey.

But when Beyonce's old group Destiny's Child comes on the radio, even Kim and her buddy Carla DiBello find themselves unable to resist joining in.  Kim, 37, posted a video to her Insta Story on Saturday of herself and Carla bopping along to the 2001 Destiny's Child song Bootylicious.  Having a ball: When Beyonce's old girl group Destiny's Child comes on the radio, even Kim Kardashian (right) and her pal Carla DiBello find themselves unable to resist joining in  Rumors of a feud between Kim and Beyonce have been circulating for years, ever since Kim took up with Kanye West, her third husband and father of her children.  Early in his career, Kanye was the protege of Beyonce's husband Jay-Z - though late in 2016, Kanye lambasted Jay-Z onstage for not paying a visit after Kim was traumatically robbed at gunpoint in a Paris hotel.  It was not the first time Beyonce and Jay-Z were regarded as having snubbed Kim and Kanye, a couple affectionately known as 'Kimye.'  Jay-Z and Beyonce neglected to attend Kimye's Florentine wedding in 2014 - an absence that was so widely discussed, Kim's mother Kris Jenner was asked about it on The Kyle And Jackie O Show, where she airily waved the subject off.  Side by side: The two sisters, both of whom welcomed baby daughters this year, were both wrapped up in denim jackets on their car trip  Kris said of Jay-Z and Beyonce's being a no-show that 'there was so much commotion and excitement, I never, ever even gave that a second thought. I know they sent really nice wishes to Kanye and Kim and I just assumed they were working, so I didn't hear anything other than that.'  She went on to say that 'I think that there was so much going on, if you would've been there, you would've thought that was the last thing on anybody's mind.'  Yet this April on The Breakfast Club, Kanye admitted that 'at the time I was hurt' by the Carters' decision to skip his nuptials at the Forte Di Belvedere - having had their names engraved into the marble table.  Duo: Rumors of a feud between Kim and Beyonce have been circulating for years, ever since Kim took up with Kanye West; the two women are pictured at the 2015 Grammys  'You know, I gotta say, you know, I was hurt about them not coming to the wedding. I understand they was going through some things, but if it's family, you know, you're not gonna miss a wedding, you know?' he said.  When Charlamagne Tha God asked why the Carters steered clear of the wedding, Kanye said: 'I'm not sure. I'm past it, but at the time I was hurt about it.'  Beyonce did wish them 'a lifetime of unconditional love' via Instagram, and there were outside circumstances rumored to have led to her and Jay-Z's non-attendance.  Throwback: Early in his career, Kanye was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Beyonce's husband Jay-Z; the two couples are pictured in the audience of the 2012 BET Awards  Only a few weeks before the wedding, on the night of the 2014 Met Ball, security footage in an elevator captured Beyonce's sister Solange kicking and striking Jay-Z, who gallantly declined to fight back.  Beyonce could be seen standing by, then eventually pushing her way between her sister and husband as a man in a suit pulled Solange away from her target.  On the night of her attack on Jay-Z, Solange also allegedly shouted at fashion designer Rachel Roy - a guest at Kimye's wedding.  Powerhouse: In 2016, Kanye lambasted Jay-Z onstage for not paying a visit after Kim was traumatically robbed; he is pictured playing a different concert the same month  In 2016, when Beyonce appeared to accuse Jay-Z of adultery on her visual album Lemonade, a rash of unsubstantiated Internet rumors flared that Rachel had been his other woman - 'Becky with the good hair,' as Beyonce called her.  There is the possibility that Beyonce and Jay-Z avoided the Kimye nuptials in order to maintain a low profile amid the elevator scandal.  Jay-Z and Beyonce released their joint album Everything Is Love last month, and a couple of Jay-Z's lines on the song FRIENDS were speculated to be about Kim and Kanye's wedding.  'God bless your beautiful family': Jay-Z and Beyonce neglected to attend Kimye's Florentine wedding in 2014 - though Beyonce did congratulate them on their nuptials via Instagram  'I ain't goin' to nobody for nothin' when me and my wife beefin'. I don't care if the house on fire, I'm dyin', n****, I ain't leavin',' Jay-Z explained in verse.  Between the wedding and Kanye's onstage outburst about Jay-Z's not visiting after Kim's robbery, the two couples kept their relationship publicly friendly.  Kim and Beyonce were glimpsed chumming about at public events including Kanye's show at New York Fashion Week in February of 2015.  The same year, Kanye even said that Beck should have given up his Album Of The Year Grammy to Beyonce - though he ultimately apologized to Beck.",

In 2016, Kanye lambasted Jay-Z onstage for not paying a visit after Kim was robbed at gunpoint. The two couples have since been spotted chumming about at public events, but the elevator scandal between Beyonce and Jay-Z, which occurred just a few weeks before the wedding, may have led to their non-attendance. Jay-Z and Beyonce released their joint album Everything Is Love last month, and a couple of Jay-Z's lines on the song FRIENDS were speculated to be about Kim and Kanye's wedding.",

        "doc_2_text": "View gallery  Tom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, \u201cReputation\u201c. But, come on, Tom; anyone\u2019s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks \u2014 \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d and \u201cGetaway Car\u201d. And, since the pair didn\u2019t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would\u2019ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.  \u201cTom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor\u2019s album,\u201d a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe thought they were on good terms,\u201d our insider says, adding, \u201cAfter their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone\u2019s saying she did and he\u2019s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.\u201d Well, maybe next time, Tom.  As soon as Taylor\u2019s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here\u2019s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201ctalks sh-t.\u201d Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a \u201cplayboy\u201d who she flew \u201caround the world\u201d with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.  The second Tom reference on \u201cReputation\u201d came on the track, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn\u2019t have a \u201creason.\u201d Then, when she goes to an event where \u201cthe ties were black and the lights were white,\u201d she found her reason \u2014 a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala\u2026 the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn\u2019t work out, and that the person [Tom] should\u2019ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.  Taylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue\u2018s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.  HollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor\u2019s new album?",

        "doc_1_text": "Taylor Swift is nothing if not a vengeful lyricist and a pro at image reinvention; her new, darker, self-satirizing persona makes that abundantly clear. The singer, who dropped the music video for her scathing new single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d at Sunday night\u2019s VMAs, hid numerous details in plain sight for her fans to see, interpret and discuss.  The song, which is an aural burn book of all of Swift\u2019s past (and current) critics, takes aim at several of her more high-profile detractors with lines like \u201cI don\u2019t like your tilted stage\u201d (a possible jab at West\u2019s tilted stage on his Saint Pablo tour) and moments like her faux phone call announcing that \u201cthe old Taylor is dead,\u201d reminiscent of her controversial recorded call with the rapper.  But Swift\u2019s symbol-drenched music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, adds another layer to her good-girl-gone-bad anthem. Here are 13 things you may have missed during Sunday night\u2019s premiere \u2013 and why they matter in the world of Swifties and perpetual shade-throwing.  1. The Nils Sjoberg tombstone in the opening scene. As many will remember, Nils Sjoberg was the pseudonym that Swift used for a songwriting credit on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris\u2019 2016 summer hit, \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d When it was revealed that Swift was, in fact, the creative mind behind the single, some short-lived drama ensued, with Harris slamming his ex and bringing up her ongoing beef with Katy Perry.  2. The \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d dress. When the music video opens, Swift bursts through the ground of a graveyard as a fully fledged zombie \u2013 wearing the iconic blue dress from her \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d music video. It\u2019s notable that the video for her fairytale-inspired single was the last from her 1989 era, possibly indicating from the get-go that that era is done for good now. (Zombie Taylor is also a nice tribute to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d video.)  Editor\u2019s picks  3. The 2014 Met Gala dress. Similarly, the Swift lying prone in the grave is wearing the very Oscar de la Renta gown that the singer wore to the Met Gala in 2014. At the time, the then-24-year-old pop singer called the opportunity to wear the designer\u2019s gown \u201ca daydream realized.\u201d  4. The single dollar bill in a bathtub full of diamonds. Swift\u2019s decision to bathe in jewels and not money \u2013 but to feature a single dollar bill just beyond her right shoulder \u2013 was a very calculated one. Fans speculate that the single bill represents the $1 she was awarded after she won her sexual assault case against former radio DJ David Mueller.  5. The \u201cEt Tu Brute\u201d etchings on her golden throne. The superstar looks regal sitting atop a gold throne covered in snakes, but there\u2019s one subtle detail that adds a layer to Swift\u2019s haughty posture. On the arm of the throne, as well as on the oversized columns on either side of her seat, is the phrase \u201cEt tu Brute,\u201d a quote from William Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar. The famous line was uttered by Caesar, who was literally stabbed in the back by his former friends.  6. A snake serves Swift tea. One lucky reptile slithered straight up to Swift\u2019s seat and poured the singer some piping hot tea at one point during her snake-charmer scene, a clear nod to the idea of Swift \u201cserving tea\u201d with the symbol-laden music video.  7. Swift transforms into a Katy Perry lookalike. If elements of the scene where Swift crashes a gold sports car into a pole look familiar, it\u2019s because they are. Swift\u2019s hair in the scene looks remarkably similar to nemesis Perry\u2019s \u2018do, and the sports car itself is undeniably reminiscent to the car in Perry\u2019s 2009 video for \u201cWaking Up in Vegas.\u201d Relatedly, following the slow-motion crash, the camera zooms in on a Grammy Award the singer is holding up; Swift has 10 Grammys while Perry has been nominated for several but has yet to win one.  8. Swift and crew rob Stream Co. The singer dons a hoodie (that reads, in bedazzled letters, \u201cBlind for love\u201d) and swings a baseball bat to break and enter into a bank vault that boasts the name \u201cStream Co.\u201d \u2013 a clear nod to her previous battle with streaming services. Her full discography was made available to Spotify, Tidal, and other services earlier this year.  9. Swift heads up a class of models at Squad U. The singer has gotten plenty of flack over the years for what some have dubbed her highly manufactured, model-perfect pack of close gal pals, and this scene was a direct hit back at those perceptions. She also writhes next to a pile of unmoving figures at one point during the scene, perhaps giving a nod to the idea that she surrounds herself with \u201cfake\u201d friends.  Related  10. Those \u201cI Heart TS\u201d shirts. There was no missing the spectacle that was Swift\u2019s whirlwind relationship with Tom Hiddleston, and in one particularly damning scene, the singer dances with a group of men (including close friend and YouTube star Todrick Hall) all donning \u201cI Heart TS\u201d crop tops, a nod to the now-infamous tank top that Hiddleston donned at one of Swift\u2019s July Fourth parties. Also of note: There are eight men dancing behind her in this scene \u2013 a possible reference to Swift\u2019s eight famous exes? (Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Conor Kennedy, Harry Styles, Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston.) One more note about this particular sequence in the video, set in a mansion: While an earlier preview of this scene had many fans comparing it to Beyonce\u2019s \u201cFormation,\u201d which director Kahn downplayed, in full context, it was more reminiscent of Lady Gaga\u2019s baroque \u201cPaparazzi\u201d clip.  11. Swift stands atop a mountain of former selves. The singer looks triumphant as she strikes a pose on top of a large pile of her former iconic personas, including a ballet dancer (\u201cShake It Off\u201d), a circus marshall (from her Red tour) and even a nerdy high schooler (\u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d). At one point, the latter even gets kicked in the head by what looks to be the Vetements boots she wore on the cover of Vogue in May 2016.  12. Her besties make a \u201ccameo\u201d in the video. Swift\u2019s \u201cJunior Jewels\u201d T-shirt from her geeky \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video now displays the names of her closest pals: Gigi [Hadid], Martha [Hunt], Abigail [Anderson], Blake [Lively], Ryan [Reynolds], Claire [Kislinger], Ed [Sheeran], Selena [Gomez], Lena [Dunham], Este [Haim], Danielle [Haim], Alana [Haim] and Todrick [Hall], among others. Glaringly absent from that list: Squad mainstays Karlie Kloss, Lorde and Ruby Rose.  13. She quotes some of her most headline-making moments. The multiple Swift clones that stand on the airplane tarmac all begin to squabble with each other during the last 40 seconds of the music video, with several of the Swift personas reciting some now-familiar lines, like \u201cI\u2019d very much like to be excluded from this narrative,\u201d referencing a line from her scathing response to her feud with West and wife Kim Kardashian over his hit \u201cFamous.\u201d  From Katy Perry\u2019s spotty debut as host to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s victory to a Chester Bennington tribute, here\u2019s VMAs 2017 highs and lows.

        "doc_1_text": "Getty  Taylor Swift's much anticipated album \"Reputation\" just dropped, and her references to the infamous Kanye West feud make it clear that \"if a man talks shit,\" she \"owes him nothing.\"  The almost decade-long drama first began at the 2009 VMAs, when Kanye stormed the stage during Swift's acceptance speech for Best Female Video, took the microphone away from her and told the audience the award should have gone to Beyonce for \"Single Ladies.\" (Beyonce won Video of the Year later that night and invited Swift back on stage to give her speech.)  The popular artists seemed to bury the hatchet six years later when Swift presented Kanye with the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2015 VMAs. But in the summer of 2016, Kanye released his hit track \"Famous,\" in which he referred to Swift as \"that bitch,\" said he still might have sex with her, and took credit for her rise to fame.  Swift responded by throwing shade at Kanye during her Album of the Year acceptance speech at the Grammys, and said she never gave permission for her name and likeness to be used in the song -- but then Kanye's loyal wife Kim Kardashian released a Snapchat video of Swift and Kanye amiably discussing the lyrics over the phone before the song was released. The rest is pop culture history.  Here are all the times Swift tries to get the last word in \"Reputation\":  \"Look What You Made Me Do\"  The most obvious Kanye-related song Swift released was \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" which pushed the stars' feud back into the public eye just in time for the release of her full album. She starts by singing that she is not a fan of the \"little games,\" \"your tilted stage\" or \"the role you made me play of the fool, no, I don't like you.\"  She sings that she's \"got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined,\" and all she \"thinks about is karma.\" In the chorus, she repeatedly states that she \"don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me.\"  The music video is even more obviously about the backlash, with different versions of herself from past music videos getting annihilated while the new Taylor tells someone over the phone that the Old Taylor is \"dead.\" She even sits in a bathtub full of diamonds while miming a gun with her hand, causing some people to wonder if she was savagely mocking Kim's traumatic Paris robbery in which she was tied up at gunpoint and left in a bathtub.  The video ends with her former selves yelling at each other to \"shut up,\" judging each other for every move, and throwing unrequested criticism each other's way.  \"I Did Something Bad\"  The lyrics on this track are most likely about that infamous phone call between her and Kanye, when the rapper said he asked the pop star for permission to include her in his song \"Famous.\"  The opening lines reference never trusting \"narcissists\" even though they love her, with a chorus that rings out a continuous, \"They say I did something bad / But why's it feel so good? / Most fun I ever had / And I'll do it over and over and over again if I could.\"  Kanye has consistently been named one of the biggest narcissists in the industry, and Swift seems to show no regrets calling him out: \"If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing.\"  The song is sung in autotune, one of Kanye's favorite musical styles. Swift also sings about \"receipts and reasons\" (Kim's Snapchat video) and likens herself to a witch being burned at the stake. \"They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one / They got their pitchforks and proof / Their receipts and reasons / They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one / So light me up.\"  \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things\"  This track opens with Swift reflecting on just how great life was before the tables turned against her. \"It was so nice being friends again / There I was giving you a second chance / But then you stabbed my back while shaking my hand / And therein lies the issue / Friends don't try to trick you / Get you on the phone and mind-twist you / And so I took an ax to a mended fence.\"  The lines about friends not trying to trick you and phone calls mind-twisting you is surely a striking reference to the Snapchat video that went viral after Kim used it to clear her husband's name and throw Swift under the bus. Swift even asks at one point, \"So why'd you have to rain on my whole parade?\"  She then takes a low but effective blow with an apparent reference to the broken friendship between Kanye and Jay Z after Kanye made negative comments about Beyonc\u00e9. \"But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately / If only you weren't so shady.\"  Swift then gives a toast to her real friends: \"They don't care about that he said, she said / And here's to my baby / He ain't reading what they call me lately / And here's to my momma / Had to listen to all this drama / And here's to you / 'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do / Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face!\"  \"Call It What You Want\"  This dreamy ballad is mostly about Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn staying by her side and ignoring all the drama, but there may still be a few sly references to the Kanye feud.  She opens the song by saying, \"My castle crumbled over night / I brought a knife to a gun fight / They took the crown but it's all right,\" describing how her career took a big hit after Kim Kardashian exposed her on Snapchat.  Later in the song, she mentions \"all the drama queens taking swings / all the jokers dressing up as kings\" -- another possible a reference to Kim Kardashian's reality TV career and Kanye's tendency to call himself a genius.",

It can strengthen you instead.\"\n\nSwift has also released several songs on her album that reference the feud. \"Look What You Made Me Do\" is the most obvious Kanye-related song Swift released, which pushed the stars' feud back into the public eye just in time for the release of her full album. The music video is even more obviously about the backlash, with different versions of herself from past music videos getting annihilated while the new Taylor tells someone over the phone that the Old Taylor is \"dead.\"\n\n\"I Did Something Bad\" is another track on the album that is most likely about that infamous phone call between her and Kanye, when the rapper said he asked the pop star for permission to include her in his song \"Famous.\" The opening lines reference never trusting \"narcissists\" even though they love her, with a chorus that rings out a continuous, \"They say I did something bad / But why's it feel so good? / Most fun I ever had / And I'll do it over and over and over again if I could.\"\n\nSwift also sings about \"receipts and reasons\" (Kim's Snapchat video) and likens herself to a witch being burned at the stake. \"They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one / They got their pitchforks and proof / Their receipts and reasons / They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one / So light me up.\"\n\nThe album also features \"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,\" which opens with Swift reflecting on just how great life was before the tables turned against her. The lines about friends not trying to trick you and phone calls mind-twisting you is surely a striking reference to the Snapchat video that went viral after Kim used it to clear her husband's name and throw Swift under the bus. Swift even asks at one point, \"So why'd you have to rain on my whole parade?\"\n\nFinally, there's \"Call It What You Want,\" a dreamy ballad that is mostly about Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn staying by her side and ignoring all the drama. However, there may still be a few sly references to the Kanye feud. She opens the song by saying, \"My castle crumbled over night / I brought a knife to a gun fight / They took the crown but it's all right,\" describing how her career took a big hit after Kim Kardashian exposed her on Snapchat. Later in the song, she mentions \"all the drama queens taking swings / all the jokers dressing up as kings\" -- another possible reference to Kim Kardashian's reality TV career and Kanye's tendency to call himself a genius.\n\nOverall, Swift's \"Reputation\" album is a clear response to her feud with Kanye West and a reminder that she is not afraid to speak her mind.",

Fans also realized her album release date, Nov. 10, is the 10-year death anniversary of Donda West, who died of heart disease while suffering multiple post-operative factors after plastic surgery.  Some accused Swift of being vindictive, while others stood up for the singer, saying she wouldn\u2019t stoop that low:  As soon as \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d was released, fans reacted to the specific lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t like your little games / I don\u2019t like your tilted stage,\u201d saying it was a reference to West.  Though Swift doesn\u2019t mention him by name in the song, the rapper used a tilted stage while on his Saint Pablo tour.  The lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t like your kingdom keys / They once belonged to me\u201d could also be a reference to West\u2019s album with JAY-Z, titled Watch the Throne. In a sneak peek of Swift\u2019s music video, she can be seen sitting on a throne with the words \u201cET TU BRUTE\u201d etched onto the arm.  Last summer, Swift\u2019s feud with West, 40, exploded after Kim Kardashian West, 36, leaked a phone call between the \u201cShake It Off\u201d singer and her husband on Snapchat. In the edited clips of the call, Swift appeared to give West her blessing over a line referencing her in his song, \u201cFamous.\u201d  However, Swift hit back at the couple afterwards on Instagram, saying West never told her he was going to call Swift \u201cthat bitch\u201d in his song. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world,\u201d she captioned her post. \u201cHe promised to play the song for me, but he never did.\u201d  Swift and West have had a complicated relationship since 2009, when the rapper interrupted the singer\u2019s best female video acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards. The duo appeared to have patched up their differences and were seen buddying up at the Grammy Awards in 2014 before Swift presented an award to West at the MTV VMAs later that year.",

It's been widely reported that Swift is currently in a relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, and by the looks of some of her lyrics throughout the album, they are very happy together.  That said, with reputation only hours old, we don't have nearly enough evidence to know the meanings behind these songs for certain. But even without knowing specific details and stories that led to the creation of this tracklist, one thing is plainly clear: Swift's songwriting has gotten quite risque.  Here are 10 of the sexiest lyrics from reputation.  \"...Ready For It?\"  \"In the middle of the night, in my dreams / You should see the things we do, baby\"  \"End Game\"  \"It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold / You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks / So here's a truth from my red lips\"  \"Don't Blame Me\"  \"Lord, save me, my drug is my baby / I'll be usin' for the rest of my life\"  \"Delicate\"  \"Do the girls back home touch you like I do? / Long night, with your hands up in my hair\"  \"So It Goes...\"  \"Lipstick on your face / So it goes\u2026 / I'm yours to keep / And I'm yours to lose / You know I'm not a bad girl, but I / Do bad things with you\"  \"King of My Heart\"  \"So prove to me I'm your American Queen / And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat / And we rule the kingdom inside my room\"  \"Late in the night, the city's asleep / Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep / Change my priorities / The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury\"  \"Dancing with Our Hands Tied\"  \"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis\"  \"Dress\"  \"Carve your name into my bedpost / \u2019Cause I don't want you like a best friend / Only bought this dress so you could take it off\"  \"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation / My hands are shaking from holding back from you\"",

Now, we know.  Released barely two weeks after welcoming twins with Bey, Jay spends 4:44 meditating on his fame, wealth, troubled upbringing and experience as a black man in America. But before he gets to all that, he has a certain elevator fight to address.  Jay doesn't waste any time in airing his grievances, referencing his infamous scuffle with his sister-in-law Solange only minutes into the album's first track KillJay Z, talking to himself about how he lost control that night and unexpectedly name-dropping '90s R&B singer Eric Ben\u00e9t.  \"You egged Solange on, knowin' all along all you had to say you was wrong / You almost went Eric Ben\u00e9t, let the baddest girl in the world get away / I didn't even know what else to say. Never go Eric Ben\u00e9t / I don't even know what you woulda done, in the future, other (expletive) playing football with your son,\" he raps, with the internet interpreting his \"football\" comment as a subtle jab at Future, whose ex Ciara married Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.  Hurry! Here's how you can listen to JAY-Z's new album, '4:44' for free  Jay continues his apology tour on 4:44, an unflinchingly honest track where he addresses Beyonce head-on, atoning for his various sins and indirectly referencing his alleged cheating.  \"And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do / If they ain't look at me the same, I would prolly die with all the shame / You did what with who? What good is a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois when you have a soulmate, you risked that for Blue?\" he says.  However, just like Jay made an appearance in Bey's All Night video, signaling to viewers of Lemonade's visual album that all was well with the Carter family, Bey shows up on the 4:44 song Family Feud. The track prominently features her vocals, and according to the 4:44 album credits, she's listed as a co-writer on the track.  \"My wife in the crib feeding my kids liquid gold, we in a whole different mode,\" Jay starts, before referencing Lemonade's most notorious lyric halfway through the track.  \u201cI\u2019ll (expletive) up a good thing if you let me / Let me alone, Becky! / A man who don\u2019t take care of his family can\u2019t be rich / I watched Godfather, I missed that whole (expletive),\" he raps, referencing to the mystery \"Becky with the good hair\" from Sorry, which many fans interpreted as an allusion to Jay's infidelity.  As Jay says on Family Feud, \"Nobody wins when the family lose,\" before bringing his oldest daughter, Blue Ivy, to contribute the introduction to the album's closing track, Legacy.  One of the album's more unexpected targets is Kanye West, who railed against his Watch the Throne partner during an onstage rant last November for apparently not returning his calls.  \"You gave him 20 million without thinking, He gave you 20 minutes on stage, (expletive) was he thinking?\" Jay raps during Kill Jay Z. \"'(Expletive) wrong with everybody?' is what you sayin', But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane.\"  On a lighter note, the second-to-last track Moonlight is named after the 2017 best picture-winning movie.  \"Ya'll stuck in La La Land / Even when we win, we gon' lose,\" he says in the chorus, explaining the song's Moonlight/La La Land connection in an interview with iHeart Radio.  \"The hook is \u2018We stuck in La La Land/Even if we win, we gonna lose,'\" he said. \"It\u2019s like a subtle nod to La La Land winning the Oscar, and then having to give it to Moonlight. It\u2019s really a commentary on the culture and where we\u2019re going.\"  Along with Beyonce, 4:44 also features guests including Frank Ocean and Damien Marley. Ready to listen? The album is available for free via iHeartRadio for its first 24 hours before going back behind TIDAL's paywall, so stream it here.",

But rewind back to 2009, and you\u2019d get a very different story.  Well, at least for Taylor and Kim. That was, of course, the year the drama between the Reputation songstress and Kanye started, when he interrupted her accepting the award for Video of the Year at the MTV VMAs.  Eventually, the two made up, but the feud was revived in 2016 when they fought over the rapper rapping \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d in his song \u201cFamous.\u201d  Of course, things only got worse after that, as Kim released a video of the phone call Taylor and Kanye had where she gave him permission to use that line.  So really, up until last year, there were no hard feelings between the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and singer \u2014 and now there\u2019s video proof!  In a resurfaced interview from 2009, the now-36-year-old reality star gushes about Taylor, calling herself a big fan of her work.  \u201cI love Taylor Swift, I\u2019m the biggest Taylor Swift fan,\u201d the mother of two tells a reporter on the red carpet.  She goes on to add that her \u201cnumber one song\u201d on her iPod \u2014 throwback alert! \u2014 is Tay\u2019s 2008 single, \u201cLove Story.\u201d  Blast from the past! Back in 2009, Kim Kardashian proclaims she was Taylor Swift's \"biggest fan.\" pic.twitter.com/RyBgeiyWqj EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) August 30, 2017  Cue another dated reference: \u201cI\u2019m watching her on Twitter, I just signed up on Twitter. I\u2019m watching you, Taylor, following.\u201d  Oh how time flies, right? It should be noted that at the time, Kim wasn\u2019t even dating her now-husband yet. In fact, she wasn\u2019t even dating Kris Humphries \u2014 they didn\u2019t meet for another year after that!  Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images  Interestingly, we hear Taylor\u2019s new music hasn\u2019t had the impact on the Wests she hoped it would have. Sources have said the couple \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about her attacks, are focusing on their family, and even note that she\u2019s not \u201con their radar.\u201d  Still, she\u2019s on Kim\u2019s radar when it comes to social media following, as the blonde recently surpassed the Instagram heavyweight in followers.  The two are neck-and-neck at 102.9 million IG fans, and with Taylor pulling ahead slightly, Kim seemingly retaliated with a risque post on Thursday.  In an apparent bid to gain more followers, she posted a sexy shot of her sunbathing in a nude string bikini.

        "generated_text": "In a surprising turn of events, Kim Kardashian has revealed that she was once Taylor Swift's biggest fan. The revelation comes from a resurfaced interview from 2009, where Kim gushes about Swift, calling herself a big fan of her work. \"I love Taylor Swift, I'm the biggest Taylor Swift fan,\" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star tells a reporter on the red carpet.\n\nKim wasn't even dating her now-husband, Kanye West, at the time, and sources have said that the couple \"don't care\" about Swift's recent attacks and are focusing on their family. However, Kim is still following Swift on social media, and the two have a similar number of Instagram followers, with Swift pulling ahead slightly.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor Swift fans have been busy investigating whether there is a hidden message in her new UPS commercial. Fans have slowed down the background music of Swift's new commercial and pointed out that it seems to be teasing a new song, perhaps titled \"Front Page,\" given the album cover's resemblance to a newspaper or tabloid.\n\nDespite the feud between Swift and Kanye, it seems that Kim was a big fan of Swift's work even back in 2009. It's interesting to see how tastes and priorities can change over time.",

When \"Look What You Made Me Do\" came out, fans spent hours decoding the lyrics and writing theories. They did the same for the music video and also for \"...Ready for It?,\" her second promo single, which dropped the next week. There's a lot to unpack with these releases too: Swift is a crafty wordsmith. She has a knack for writing lyrics that seem obvious at first but actually have secret, mysterious meaning.  And the same thing can be said for \"Gorgeous,\" the track she released last night. However, fans won't have to give up their weekends figuring out the subject of this one: Swift already spilled the beans.  Well, she (allegedly) spilled the beans to the 300 fans who attended her Reputation secret listening sessions. One of those lucky Swifties took to Tumblr and wrote, \"Basically Taylor made us all promise that if anyone made any accusations of who this song is about, we tell them it is 100 percent about her angel boyfriend of one year. This isn't a secret. She wanted us to tell people.\" (Swift's been dating actor Joe Alwyn for a year.) See their post for yourself, below:  X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.  It's great Swift's being so transparent about \"Gorgeous,\" but, honestly, the lyrics aren't that tough to crack. \"You should take it as a compliment / That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,\" she sings at one point. (Alwyn is British.) \"And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us / He's in the club doing, I don't know what,\" she sings again. Alwyn is 26, and the two men who Swift could be referring to as her boyfriend\u2014Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston\u2014are both older than him, though our money's on Harris, considering he's one of the highest-paid DJs in the world. Regardless, it's pretty obvious \"Gorgeous\" is about Alwyn, but, hey, at least now we know for sure.

She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.\u201d  Swift, for one of the first times in the public eye, has not talked about Alwyn in any interviews. She has barely been photographed out with him, though this week they were shot holding hands in Turks and Caicos. \u201cThey seemed genuinely happy,\u201d a witness there told Us of their interactions out and about there. \u201cThey were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.\u201d  Swift isn't about to say anything about Alwyn though, another source cautioned the outlet.

The stans were screaming, \u201cYAS,\u201d and everyone else was like, \u201cHmm, okay.\u201d No matter what you think of it, it\u2019s clear that Swift had a vision. One of those visions was seizing every narrative that\u2019s ever been crafted about her and monetizing it.  Swift\u2019s online shop features snake accessories and something a little more subversive. Remember that \u201cI Heart TS\u201d tank that Tom Hiddleston was spotted wearing in the ocean last July 4th at Swift\u2019s Rhode Island house? The very same shirts that were featured in her new music video on her backup dancers?  Yeah, Swift sells \u201cI <3 TS\u201d shirts now.  In her online shop, she sells them for $50 a pop.  She also sells a crop-top version. To think that a thing everyone made fun of is going to be worn on the backs of every pre-teen fan in the audience at her shows is mind-boggling. If this is something you\u2019re into, you can buy it here.  Also, just because the symbol needs to be mentioned, Swift has $60 snake rings in her online shop as well.  Back when \u201cI <3 TS\u201d was only a Hiddleswift meme, Hiddleston himself explained how he came to wear said shirt.  \u201cThe truth is it was the Fourth of July and a public holiday and we were playing a game and I slipped and hurt my back,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cAnd I wanted to protect the graze from the sun and said, \u2018Does anyone have a T-shirt?\u2019 And one of her friends said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 We all laughed about it.

        "doc_1_text": "Maeve McDermott  USATODAY  As one of hip hop's foremost elder statesmen, JAY-Z reserves the right to diss anyone he wants to. And on his new album 4:44 , he takes full advantage of his rap seniority, delivering blink-and-you'll-miss-it wordplay that punishes targets from Kanye and Future to Cosby and Bill Maher.  Below, revisit the long list of targets Jay slanders on 4:44.  JAY-Z: Before we get to any of Jay's other targets, let's be clear about the person he spends the most time beating up on the album \u2014 himself. 4:44 is full of self-owns, showing the rapper kicking himself about his infamous elevator fight with Solange in the elevator on KillJay Z: \"You egged Solange on, knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong.\"  Kanye West: Before he turns on himself, Jay tears into Kanye West, his once-frequent collaborator before their friendship soured. Minutes into the album, on 4:44's very first track, KillJay Z, he alludes to allegedly giving Kanye $20 million to stay with TIDAL, only to see the younger rapper slander him onstage during his Saint Pablo tour days before his hospitalization.  \"But you ain't a Saint, this ain't KumbaYe, but you got hurt because you did cool by Ye / You gave him 20 million without blinking, he gave you 20 minutes on stage, (expletive) was he thinking / '(Expletive) wrong with everybody?' is what you saying, but if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane.\"  Future: Many listeners interpreted this lyric on Kill Jay Z as a reference to his fellow rapper: \"I don't even know what you woulda done, In the future other (expletive) playin' football with your son.\"  Future went through a messy split with his ex Ciara, who later married Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. The exes made headlines with their spats over their son, whose dad allegedly didn't like spending time with Wilson. In this lyric, Jay seems to use Future's situation as a warning to himself to treat his family better, though he appears to slander his I Got the Keys collaborator.  Exclusive: Eric Ben\u00e9t responds to JAY-Z's '4:44'\u2014'Where are my royalties!'  Twitter is on fire with reactions to JAY-Z\u2019s \u20184:44\u2019 album  Becky with the Good Hair: \"I'll (expletive) up a good thing if you let me / Let me alone, Becky\" Jay raps on Family Feud, dispensing with the \"Becky\" that Beyonc\u00e9 notoriously mentioned on her Lemonade track Sorry.  O.J. Simpson: While Jay's The Story of O.J. track isn't entirely about Simpson, the track's first verse shows the rapper rolling his eyes at one of the disgraced football player's most notorious alleged quotes. \"O.J. like, 'I'm not black, I'm O.J.' ... Okay,\" he says.  La La Land: Jay was obviously rooting for Moonlight to win the 2017 best picture Oscar over La La Land. In addition to naming one of his 4:44 tracks Moonlight, he also dedicates the song's chorus to the losing film: \"We stuck in La La Land, even when we win, we gon' lose.\"    According to Jay's iHeartRadio interview, the song is a direct reference to the 2017 Oscars. \"The hook is \u2018We stuck in La La Land/Even if we win, we gonna lose,'\" he said. \"It\u2019s like a subtle nod to La La Land winning the Oscar, and then having to give it to Moonlight. It\u2019s really a commentary on the culture and where we\u2019re going.\"  Bill Maher: Jay mentions the Real Time host dropping the n-word on a recent episode. \"House (expletive), don't (expletive) with me / I'm a field (expletive) with shined cutlery,\" he says on The Story of O.J.  Bill Cosby: There's no love lost between Jay and Bill Cosby, with the rapper putting down the disgraced comic, along with Al Sharpton, on Family Feud: \"Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies / How is him or Pill Cosby supposed to help me?\"  Prince's former lawyer: As Jay raps on Caught Their Eyes, \"I sat down with Prince, eye to eye / He told me his wishes before he died / Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind / They only see green from them purple eyes.\"  Before Prince died, he made a deal with TIDAL to make his music exclusive to Jay's streaming service. After the late singer's death, McMillan, serving as the adviser to the late singer's estate, granted other streaming services like Apple and Spotify access to Prince's catalog.",

But is she already ready for another one? The BeyHive sure think so after the 36-year-old singer was photographed with what fans claim to be a very obvious baby bump.  To prove their theory, many fans are referencing a video from a recent concert on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s On the Run Tour II with Jay-Z. The video shows Beyonc\u00e9 in a sparkly white outfit with what fans are confident is a small baby bump sticking out of her midsection.  In addition to Star magazine (a not-so-reliable tabloid, if we\u2019re being honest) reporting that the singer is \u201cover the moon\u201d with her pregnancy, fans are also referencing a tour outfit that they believe is a secret message from Beyonc\u00e9 herself, proving that she\u2019s pregnant. The outfit, a skin-tight gold dress that Beyonc\u00e9 pairs with a giant cape, features a heart on her midsection, which many fans believe represents her baby\u2019s heartbeat.Given Bey and Jay-Z\u2019s love for the number four (4:44 is the title of Jay-Z\u2019s last album and their wedding anniversary is on April 4), it makes sense that the couple is expecting their fourth child, as fans have noted. Needless to say, the BeyHive is alive with speculation (and worry that Bey might cancel the rest of her tour to go on maternity leave.)  As excited as we would be for another Beyonc\u00e9 pregnancy, it\u2019s important to note that neither she nor Jay-Z have confirmed anything. And until they do, all rumors are speculation. Likewise, as Lili Reinhart, Drew Barrymore, Blac Chyna, and dozens of other celebrities who have fought off pregnancy rumors have proven, bloating is a real thing and assuming that someone is pregnant based on how much their stomach resembles a \u201cbaby bump\u201d is dangerous and a form of body-shaming.

Federal prosecutors in Nashville said in a press release Thursday that Eric Swarbrick, of Austin, has been charged with interstate stalking and sending interstate communications with the intent to threaten.  He is currently in custody in Texas and will be brought to Tennessee at a later date.  Under lock and key: Suspected stalker Eric Swarbrick, 26, (left), has been arrested on federal charges of interstate stalking and sending interstate communications with the intent to threaten Taylor Swift (pictured on August 25 in Nashville, right)  According to prosecutors, Swarbrick personally delivered letters threatening to rape and kill the Reputation songstress and himself to the Big Machine Label Group office on multiple occasions and was arrested by Nashville police on August 2.  He was released from custody, but continued to send letters and emails.  'Too often, we have seen the consequences of ignoring signs of escalating violent behavior by some individuals,' said US Attorney Cochran. 'The attention given to this matter by our law enforcement partners and the resulting federal charges we have brought should serve to prevent a future tragic event.'  According to the complaint, in January 2018, Big Machine Label Group in Nashville began receiving letters from Swarbrick expressing his desire for BMLG CEO Scott Borchetta to introduce him to Swift.  In one letter, Swarbrick acknowledges that he has been wandering around the offices of BMLG in the past. Over time, the letters became increasingly violent and sexual in nature, with at least 40 letters and emails being received by the music label, according to the complaint.  The Grammy winner previously has been granted a restraining order against Swarbrick. The Austin man had allegedly been sending threatening letters and emails to her music label since 2016  On three separate occasions, the 26-year-old Swarbrick allegedly drove from Texas to Nashville and personally delivered letters to BMLG, including on August 2, at which time he was arrested.  After being released from custody, Swarbrick allegedly proceeded to send at least 13 threatening letters and emails before the end of August.  In many of the letters, the complaint states, Swarbrick talked about wanting to rape and kill Swift, and in one he stated he would kill himself in front of Borchetta and his staff.  If convicted, Swarbrick faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.  Last week, TMZ reported that the 28-year-old Grammy winner previously has been granted a restraining order against Swarbrick, who had been allegedly stalking her since 2016.  Court documents quoted Swarbrick as writing in one letter sent to the pop star: 'I want to rape Taylor Swift. This is why I hate Taylor herself... This is how I know I am Taylor's soulmate.'  He continued: 'I have learned to absolutely repress the metaphorical monster in me, but, very soon, I will become completely responsible for myself ... What logical conclusion is there other than death.'  Crime of passion: In August, Bruce Rowley attempted to impress Swift by holding up a bank and throwing the stolen cash into her yard  Perhaps the most shocking of all was a threat that he will kill her and there is nothing authorities can do.  He stated: 'I will not hesitate to kill her ... and there's nothing you, your lawyers, or the law will be about to do about it. Remember who I am.'  In August, another alleged stalker was arrested while trying to break into Swift's Beverly Hills mansion carrying a knife, live ammunition and black rope.  Swift, who has been traveling around the country with her Reputation Stadium Tour since May, was not home at the time.  The man, 38-year-old Julius Alexander Sandrock, from Colorado, was wearing a mask and rubber gloves, and had additional masks, bullets and drugs in his car.  He was charged with felony stalking but later released on bail.  Days before this, a third man, Bruce Rowley, attempted to impress to the singer by allegedly robbing a bank in Connecticut before driving to her Rhode Island home and tossing the stolen cash over the fence.",

He has slowed down a little and is not the same old Kanye that was always ready to fight on a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  \u201cBut Kim is feeling fine, alert and she watching Taylor like a mama bear protecting her cubs. Kim will be listening closely as Taylor continues to release new music. Kim and Kanye were willing to let the first song slide, but if Taylor wants to pick another fight, Kim is ready for it,\u201d our insider adds. T-Swift\u2019s new track has the same title as Kanye\u2019s 2010 song off of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, so everyone\u2019s wondering if it\u2019s going to be another diss at the rapper in their ongoing feud.  Taylor came out swinging hard against Kim and Kanye in \u201cLWYMMD,\u201d where she made it abundantly clear in her lyrics that \u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d She dissed his tilted concert stage, Kim\u2019s Paris armed robbery and saying karma was coming back around to bite them after the reality star released the tape of a private conversation between Tay and Yeezy where she appeared to give consent to being shaded in the lyrics to his song \u201cFamous.\u201d Come ON, just the lines \u201cThe world moves on, another day, another drama, drama. But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma. And then the world moves on, but one thing\u2019s for sure. Maybe I got mine, but you\u2019ll all get yours,\u201d show Taylor is willing to come hard. See pics of the singer\u2019s \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video looks, here  All we know so far is that \u201cGorgeous\u201d features a deep synth beat from the teaser she shared with fans on Oct. 19. Interestingly enough, she also showed off the song title in the same font that she\u2019s using for her new album Reputation, which practically mirrors the lettering that Kanye used to market merchandise from his St. Pablo tour. Oh man, midnight can not come fast enough!  HollywoodLifers, do you think \u201cGorgeous\u201d will be another diss track at Kanye?",

The reality star doesn't want her husband, Kanye West, to be the subject of another diss track from Swift, who has been feuding with the couple for years.

        "doc_1_text": "Taylor Swift MIA: 7 Legit(ish) Theories To Explain Where The Popstar Has Disappeared To  WHERE IS SHE?!  We\u2019ve got a real quick question for you:  Where the F is Taylor Swift at the moment?  We\u2019re used to seeing her all over Instagram with her girl gang, or leaving the gym looking sweaty yet stylish (shout out to that time she used a \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 Celine handbag as her gym bag).  But recently, our favourite pop princess has been a little MIA, so we thought it was about time that we figured out where on earth she is.  Or, at least, speculate and put together some outlandish theories - basically the same thing right?  So, here it goes.  Last Spotted: 11th January 2017  Last Performed: 4th February 2017  Last Posted (On Instagram): 4th May 2017  Current Location: New York (we think\u2026)  Recent Meetings: We saw Ed Sheeran leave her apartment in Manhattan back in March\u2026 Other than that, not much to report.  Until the 4th May 2017, we hadn't seen or heard of Taylor on Instagram for at least two months. How did she mark her come back? With an Instagram post dedicated to her BFF's in girlband, HAIM on the release of their new song, 'Want You Back'. Naturally, the Instagram photo was a screenshot of the song playing on her phone (much like when Lorde released 'Green Light') and it was stopped on 0:13secs. Not exactly a coincidence when she has been known to make it very obvious in the past that 13 is her lucky number. That said, it's nice to see the squad leader back on social media.  On. Repeat. Til. The. End. Of. Time. @haimtheband A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) onMay 3, 2017 at 8:25pm PDT  But will she stick around?  Theory #1: She\u2019s Living A Quieter Life.  Back in March, police arrested a man for burglary, stalking and trespassing in Taylor\u2019s apartment. A criminal complaint stated that the guy turned up at least four times in the past two months.  Whilst we really hope that it\u2019s not the reason she\u2019s been living a quieter life, we don\u2019t blame her for wanting to take a small break.  Theory #2: She\u2019s Exhausted.  Just us or did her 1989 world tour seem to go on FOREVER? Thus, we\u2019re not really surprised that she wanted a bit of downtime.  Theory #3: She\u2019s Pulling An Ed Sheeran.  \u2018An Ed Sheeran\u2019: When a popstar goes in hiding for a period of time before coming back and releasing ALL the music and getting ALL the number ones.  See also: Adele.  Theory #4: She\u2019s In The Studio.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise us if she had built a studio in her apartment so she has no reason to leave the house. Much like other artists, perhaps she is locking herself away from the world to focus on her next album. An album of which her BFF, Ed Sheeran, hinted that we could be getting around Christmas time.  And according to sources, we might not be too far off the jackpot with this theory as apparently she is now recording new music! They commented that \"Taylor has been writing and recording her new album in Nashville for the last several months. She has been working on it quietly around the clock and will be making an announcement soon. She is really excited about her new music and can't wait to share it with her fans. She has been entirely focused on that and not much else. She has been 100% dedicated to making music the last few months and that's it\".  NEW TAYLOR SWIFT MUSIC?! YES. PLEASE.  Theory #5: She\u2019s Gone Missing.  Some fans are seriously concerned about Taylor\u2019s absence from all things to do with life and are even speculating that she\u2019s gone missing. Oh, and that her record label is currently looking for a clone to replace her.  Theory #6: She\u2019s Still Mourning The Hiddleswift Break-Up.  Others think that ex boyfriend Tom Hiddleston is the reason that we haven\u2019t heard much from Taylor recently. Perhaps she\u2019s sticking to her lyric \u201cwe are never ever getting back together\u201d and is now seeing someone new that she wants to keep hidden from the world.  Theory #7: She\u2019s The Founder Of The Church Of Satan.  Okay, we\u2019re sorry but this one is surely the most ridiculous nonsense ever?!  Rumour has it that Taylor Swift (in this case, the clone) was created in order to get more people into the Church of Satan. Taylor Swift was born in 1989, and Schreck (the person that Taylor is meant to be a clone of) left the church in 1990.  can we talk about how taylor swift really fckn look like zeena lavey....? \u2014 beby (@baecteria) January 5, 2017  I fully support the theory that #taylorswift is a clone of a former satanic priestess Zeena LeVey. \u2014 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043a (@fag_plague) January 19, 2017  Here\u2019s the video that everyone is basing speculation on:  You May Also Like...",

        "doc_2_text": "Many stars saw great success in 2016, but the year wasn\u2019t without its major celebrity scandals. Here are some of the worst celebrity scandals of the year:  1. Chumlee\u2019s home raided  \u201cPawn Stars\u201d favorite Austin Lee Russell, better known as Chumlee, was arrested in March after police serving a search warrant in a sexual assault investigation found methamphetamine, marijuana and a gun at his southwest Las Vegas home. The 33-year-old was booked on 19 drug-possession charges and one weapon charge. In May, the reality star took a plea deal and agreed to counseling and three years' probation.  2. Taylor Swift\u2019s image questioned  Hollywood good girl Taylor Swift came under intense scrutiny in 2016 after her messy breakup with Calvin Harris and her reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.  First, Harris slammed Swift for comments her PR team made about a song they\u2019d worked on together. Referencing Swift\u2019s long rumored feud with Katy Perry he wrote on Twitter, \u201cI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry...\u201d  Then, Swift slammed Kanye West at the Grammys for his lyrics to \u201cFamous,\u201d in which he rapped about her \u201cI made that bitch famous.\u201d At the Grammys, Swift cautioned her fans about \u201cpeople\u2026 who try to undercut your success or take credit for\u2026 your fame.\" West insisted he\u2019d had the pop star\u2019s permission to include her in his song, and in July, Kim Kardashian was ready to prove it. She released a recording of Swift speaking with West, approving of her name being used on the track.  The incidents left Swift fans wondering if the starlet was secretly a celebrity mean girl.  Since then, however, she has avoided controversy and done charity work that likely has her back in the good graces of the Twitterverse.    3. Ryan Lochte\u2019s lie  Ryan Lochte had a lot going for him as he headed to Rio for the Olympics over the summer, but the spotlight-hungry swimmer was branded a liar after he claimed he\u2019d been robbed at gunpoint while out in Brazil, and then recanted the story once inconsistencies became apparent. Lochte lost his sponsorships over the incident, and the Olympic Committee banned him from swimming through June 2017. He also lost $100,000 in bonuses.  Still, the swimmer landed a short-lived slot on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and got engaged to his Playboy model girlfriend, so all in all he didn\u2019t have the worst 2016 ever.  4. Accusations against Johnny Depp  In May, Johnny Depp made headlines for all the wrong reasons when his ex Amber Heard accused him of abusing her. In the weeks that followed, a video leaked of a violent clash between Heard and Depp and fans quickly turned on the actor. His camp denied the abuse allegations and several of his famous exes came forward to defend his character. In August, Depp and Heard quietly settled their divorce. He has since landed a role in J.K. Rowling\u2019s upcoming sequel to \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\u201d  5. Brad Pitt abuse allegations  Brangelina fans were shocked when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced they were going their separate ways in 2016. The pair announced they were calling it quits in September, and things turned even more dramatic when rumors swirled that Pitt was being accused of abusing their oldest son Maddox. In November, the FBI wrapped their investigation into an alleged argument between Pitt and Maddox that took place on a plane, and the agency announced no charges would be filed against Pitt.  6. Kimye turmoil  Both Kim Kardashian and Kanye West faced serious struggles in 2016. Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in October in Paris and thieves made off with millions of dollars in jewelry. The Instagram addict removed herself from the public eye after the traumatic experience. She stopped sharing things on social media and avoided public appearances, opting to stay home with her family.  Then, at the end of November, her husband Kanye West\u2019s trademark erratic behavior took a serious turn when he was hospitalized for a reported psychotic breakdown. The rapper had been ranting more than ever during his concerts \u2013 something he is known for \u2013 and abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour. He was then suddenly hospitalized and Kim rushed to be by his side. 2016 wasn\u2019t the best year for the Hollywood hot couple to say the least.  7. Gigi mocks Melania  In November, model Gigi Hadid faced backlash after she mocked Melania Trump during her speech at the American Music Awards. \"I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children Sasha and Malia,\" Hadid said through pouted lips and a fake accent, mocking Melania's RNC speech that lifted material from a speech given by Michelle Obama.  The 21-year-old sort of apologized and said that her impression was \"done in good humor.\"",

        "doc_1_text": "Around 11AM ET, all traces of Taylor Swift disappeared from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, and her official website.  She\u2019s been relatively quiet on social media all year, and last fall she broke with her tradition of releasing an album every other October. So, fans and amateur sleuths started digging through the source code of her website within minutes, looking for clues as to what was going on. Some guessed new music; some guessed a hack. Then Tumblr spat out hundreds of screenshots of the same dubious-looking DirecTV Now listing of a Swift appearance on tomorrow\u2019s Good Morning America. There\u2019s very little evidence to support anyone\u2019s theory, but it\u2019s fun to spend an otherwise-sleepy Friday afternoon trying to sort the riddle out.  And though all of the evidence we\u2019re going to see today is definitely baloney, you can see why fans would get dragged into this rabbit hole. The best thing about a new Taylor Swift album is the fact that she leaves hidden messages in all of the liner notes, often with clues about the subject of each song. This recurring treat is gossipy, salacious, and satisfying like a crossword puzzle \u2014 essentially the modus operandi of Swift\u2019s entire career and public persona.  Theory 1: She got hacked  While celebrities often wipe their social media accounts before big announcements, it\u2019s strange that Swift\u2019s Instagram and Twitter both show that she now follows no other accounts. That kind of purge isn\u2019t common. Also, this guy says he hacked her:  It\u2019s very unlikely, given that this post went up about two hours into the online frenzy. Plus, that wouldn\u2019t explain the absence on any other platform, or her site. Swift\u2019s team is notoriously web savvy, pulling down the slightest copyright infringement in minutes and proactively buying up every domain name that could conceivably host porn about her. A security screw-up big enough to take down her entire web presence seems unlikely.  Given the non-evidence, the possibility of a hack made me nervous for only one second, but I\u2019ve reached out to Swift\u2019s record label and will update if I hear back.  Theory 2: She\u2019s announcing a new album  On top of all the posts going missing, Swift\u2019s Tumblr theme has changed, from a peachy-pink background with white type to all black. That move has some Tumblr fans pretty worked up, and the hashtag #T6 (for her theoretical sixth album) trending.  It\u2019s not a ridiculous conclusion. Her website has also gone dark, as it did before she revamped it in 2012 preceding the release of Red, and again in 2014 before the announcement of 1989. \u201cShake it Off,\u201d the lead single of that album, was announced three years ago today, and Swift has a habit of celebrating minor anniversaries and milestones in showy ways. Earlier this summer, she put her entire discography on Spotify to celebrate 1989 selling 10 million copies worldwide.  Once the idea of new music was floated, Reddit sleuths claimed to have found support for it in the source code of her site. With some finagling, they pulled out a lyric from \u201cShake it Off.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why Swift would promote a new album with an old song lyric, but it\u2019s also unclear why the sun refused to come up this morning in New York and it has been raining all day with no reprieve.  Another fan claimed to have found a message reading \u201cI\u2019ve got a blank space\u201d in the same source code.  The Verge was unable to find either of these things, but I think we can all agree that it is better to be exhilarated for a fraction of a second and disappointed for the rest of your life than it is to feel nothing.  Finally, Reddit user sigsigsignify suggested an even more obtuse message from Swift:  \u201cI think this is by design. She deleted every tweet she sent/retweeted after September 27th, 2015. I think she's hinting at September 27th the release date, 20:15 the drop time.\"  Anything is possible.  Theory 3: She\u2019s performing with Katy Perry at the VMAs  The popular Twitter account Pop Crave tweeted, then deleted, a screenshot appearing to show that Swift\u2019s Twitter account was suddenly following Katy Perry\u2019s. Even with the tweet taken down, fans interpreted that as an end to the years-long tabloid-mediated beef between them. Two years ago, Swift settled a controversial spat with Nicki Minaj with a surprise collaborative performance at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards. The weirdest music awards show of the year, and the tackiest, loudest live event of August, the VMAs are coming up again this Sunday, with Katy Perry set to host.  It\u2019d be an old trick, but who says drama has to be new and innovative every time? I think we can all agree that it is better to watch the \u201cI\u2019ll Take a Pinot Grigio\u201d episode of Vanderpump Rules 100 times than it is to watch it only one time.  It would be a classic Swift move to try to upstage the new episode of Game of Thrones. But then again, would it be more of a classic Swift move to wait another day and time whatever she may or may not be planning to coincide with Monday\u2019s solar eclipse? That\u2019s one theory we don\u2019t need to go into, because I made it up right now based on no evidence.  Theory 4: Taylor Swift is done with us  From Reddit user Sansabarnaby94:  \u201cwhat makes you think this means a new album?? maybe she just wants to quit forever??\u201d  Let\u2019s hope not. This wasn\u2019t the first boring Friday afternoon in history and it won\u2019t be the last. We need the antics of celebrities and the thrill of harmless conspiracy theory to keep our blood pumping.",

Kim Kardashian could take a major loss when Taylor Swift drops her new song at midnight tonight, and Beyonce is \u2018curious\u2019 to see what happens if she does.  \u201cBeyonce is curious to see what Taylor [Swift] may have in store for Kim Kardashian, as Taylor\u2019s about to drop some new music. Kim could take a major L when Taylor drops her new song and Beyonce is intrigued by it all. Beyonce has always been a fan of Taylor\u2019s music and will be grabbing some popcorn tonight to watch the eruption of diss track drama, which may ensue online with Taylor\u2019s new song,\u201d a source close to Beyonce tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  As Taylor previously announced, she\u2019ll be dropping the first single from her forthcoming new album (Reputation) at midnight tonight! At this time, little is known about the sure-to-be-epic new track, but rumors claim it\u2019s called \u201cTimeless.\u201d And based on Taylor\u2019s history with subtly dissing people in her songs, there\u2019s a good chance she may clap back at Kim and Kanye West for trying to annihilate her after the 2016 Grammy Awards.  As you\u2019ll recall, Kanye released his song, \u201cFamous,\u201d in which he rapped, \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that b**** famous.\u201d Taylor was upset, but Kanye later came out and said he asked her for permission before releasing the song. She denied it, but then Kim released tapes (phone conversations between Kanye and Taylor), proving Taylor was okay with the track all along. It\u2019s a complicated beef among these three, and that\u2019s exactly why Taylor may diss Kim and Kanye in her new song. And if she does, Beyonce is definitely ready to hear (and jam out to) it! She and Kim never had that great of a relationship. Especially not now, as JAY-Z and Kanye are in the midst of their own feud. So it makes sense why Beyonce\u2019s living for this moment.  HollywoodLifers, are YOU excited for Taylor\u2019s song like Beyonce is? Tell us how you feel below!",

With Beyonce and Kanye West currently in the midst of their own feud, it is possible that Swift may use her new song to clap back at Kim and Kanye. As fans continue to speculate about what Swift's new song could be about, they will have to wait until midnight to find out for sure.",

But there were hundreds of other fans in the stadium over the weekend who didn\u2019t get the same attention but probably should have.  So, Swift gave hundreds of free tickets to local police officers and firefighters following the tragic death of Weymouth Sgt. Michael Chesna, who was shot and killed on July 15. The Patriot Ledger reported that Swift sent the town \u201ca significant number of tickets\u201d to her concert. And it was a hard ticket to get.  \u201cThe gesture was absolutely generous, significant and appreciated,\u201d Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund told the Ledger, adding that Swift didn\u2019t do it for the press. Sure enough, Swift\u2019s camp hasn\u2019t said anything about the gesture when asked by the local media.  \u201cMy understanding is that they did it low-key and weren\u2019t looking for publicity,\u201d Hedlund said. \u201cThere were enough to send every police officer, firefighter and extended family to the concert, and then some.\u201d  It\u2019s a classy gesture by Swift for a grieving community and a great way to honor the men and women who serve.  Plus, as an added bonus, it meant that if she got stuck up in a basket again there were fans who work in law enforcement there to help her. Maybe one of those fire trucks with the really big ladder.

But, first let's get to that buzzy clip.  On Sunday August 27, Taylor dropped the full-length version at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, and it's a glittering, self-aware visual that tears down everything fans think they know about Taylor Swift while poking fun at every, single thing you've ever poked fun of her about, from always being surprised at award shows, to public perception that she's always playing the victim. Taylor acknowledges \u2014 and makes fun of herself for \u2014 every one of those things during the eye-popping video by bringing back to life all of her personas. Of course, this includes Taylor from the 2009 VMAs AKA the night that Kanye West bum rushed the stage. (Oh, you remember it.)

And after breakup rumors started spreading among fans, Swift also took the opportunity to make a statement about the status of her and Joe Alwyn's relationship through her necklace choice:  Splash News  Getty Images  Fans were worried that Alwyn and Swift had hit a rough patch when photos of her Sunday look\u2014a Faith Connexion dress, Elie Saab sunglasses, a Stella McCartney bag, and Jimmy Choo knee-high boots (below)\u2014very visibly didn't include Swift wearing her silver \"J\" pendant necklace, the one she appears to be wearing again today (above).  Splash News  Swift always wears the necklace as a tribute to her boyfriend and their so-happily-private romance. She explained everything about the necklace in her song, \"Call It What You Want\" with the lyrics, \"\"I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck/Chain round my neck/Not because he owns me/But 'cause he really knows me.\" Swift told some fans that all of Reputation's love songs were about Alwyn.  LaineyGossip pointed out that Sunday was just the second time Swift had been seen without her necklace; she also didn't wear it while performing last Tuesday in Maryland either. Maybe that meant something since Swift thinks about the details with her image; maybe it doesn't because it's just a necklace.  Swift performs in Maryland last week, sans necklace. Getty Images  Buzzfeed, meanwhile, noted that Swift didn't wear the pendant to the Billboard Music Awards in May, so it's not like this week was the first time in history she's ever publicly left the pendant at home. Also: She posted an Instagram (below) wearing it just four days ago. All in all, an abundance of evidence that the necklace is not any official sartorial indicator of her relationship health. It's not an engagement ring, and even those can come on and off without people breaking up.  Up until the ultimately non-dramatic necklace saga, Alwyn and Swift's romance only made headlines for how happy, private, and well it's been going.

Swift's new single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" was also featured in ABC's Thursday night TGIT lineup promos, with accounts for the three TGIT shows pumping hashtags for #TGITaylor, #Reputation, and #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo. Swift is no secret that she is a big fan of Shonda Rhimes, who produces the TGIT shows, and named her cat Meredith after a character on the show played by Ellen Pompeo.",

But now a tabloid has claimed that the Wests \u201cbarely made it this year\u201d and that Kim Kardashian said that herself. While the story could sound credible to some because of the drama that Kim and Kanye have been involved in this year, celebrity rumor watchdog, Gossip Cop, says that the story is untrue.  As Gossip Cop reports, OK! Magazine recently reported that Kim confessed that her and her husband\u2019s relationship almost didn\u2019t survive this year. They based their reporting on a tweet that Kim posted to celebrate Kanye\u2019s Birthday.  \u201cKim Kardashian Wishes Kanye A Happy Birthday \u2014 Says They Barely Made It This Year,\u201d one headline for the article declared. Another headline read, \u201cMarital Problems? Kim Kardashian Wishes Kanye A Happy Birthday \u2014 Hints They Barely Made It Through The Year.\u201d  But that\u2019s not what Kim tweeted at all. Here\u2019s what she said:  \u201cHappy Birthday babe @kanyewest!!!!! It\u2019s been a wild year but we\u2019re here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams. You inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you.\u201d  Happy Birthday babe @kanyewest !!!!! It\u2019s been a wild year but we\u2019re here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams. You inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you ? pic.twitter.com/lflFE6ePdQ \u2014 Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) June 8, 2018  As you can see, Kim never mentions that they barely made it this year. In fact, the message is pretty positive, which isn\u2019t surprising since it was sent on her husband\u2019s birthday. Kim does say that it\u2019s been \u201ca wild year,\u201d but it\u2019s a stretch to say that she really meant that their marriage was so fraught with turmoil that she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d make it through 2018.  While the tabloids keep speculating that a Kim and Kanye divorce is on the horizon, the rapper and the reality TV star have been showing that they at least have an affection/admiration for each other.  As People Magazine reports, Kanye was part a tribute video for his wife to commemorate her Influencer Award from the CFDA.  \u201cSay \u2018Hi!\u2019 We are making this video for the most influential person on the planet,\u201d the Ye rapper said as he held their son, Saint, in the short video.  Gossip Cop notes that the husband and wife duo went to Japan this year after they took a trip to the Bahamas with their family. Just last month, they were filmed kissing with a friend in the background calling them \u201cthe best married couple\u201d they knew.  Despite these outward displays of a affection, there\u2019s a chance that Kim and Kanye could get divorced in the future. That\u2019s a possibility that faces all married couples. But, contrary to that OK! Magazine cover, Kim Kardashian never said that it could have happened to her marriage this year.",

In fact, Kim recently tweeted a birthday message to Kanye that was interpreted as a sign of marital troubles, but Gossip Cop points out that the message was actually incredibly positive and celebratory. Kim simply wrote, \"Happy Birthday babe @kanyewest!!!!! It's been a wild year but we're here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams. You inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you.\"\n\nWhile it's certainly possible that Kim and Kanye could experience marital issues in the future, the tabloid's claim that their marriage was on the verge of collapse this year is simply untrue. As evidence, Gossip Cop notes that the couple has been spotted showing affection for each other and even went on a trip together after taking a family trip to the Bahamas. Additionally, Kanye even participated in a tribute video for Kim to celebrate her Influencer Award from the CFDA, further suggesting that their relationship is strong.\n\nWhile Kim may have been spotted wearing snake merchandise, this does not necessarily mean that she is referencing the \"Bad Blood\" hitmaker's new single or her feud with Swifties. It could simply be a nod to her love of snakes and her desire to support her friends. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide what they believe about the state of Kim and Kanye's marriage, but Gossip Cop stands by its reporting that the couple is not on the verge of a divorce.",

Fans have been left scratching their heads over the event, with some claiming that the entire thing was \"fake\" and \"planned.\" However, others have defended Swift and her friends, stating that they are real and that Swift makes and keeps friends.\n\nDespite the mixed reaction to the party, Swift and her friends were seen decked out in patriotic swimwear as they rode a giant inflatable slide in her garden. They also celebrated the holiday with a huge group shot, which showed off their patriotic outfits and fireworks. Swift's boyfriend Tom Hiddleston was noticeably absent from the party, leaving fans to speculate about the status of their relationship.",

As you may remember from the music video, Taylor donned some of her most memorable old looks (curly hair and all) to film the scene in which she stands atop a mountain of her \u201cformer selves.\u201d In the behind-the-scenes vid, we get to see her meet a gaggle of blonde-haired extras dressed in her old clothes and marvel, \u201cThis is the trippiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d  She continued, \u201cSeeing all of them together is the weirdest feeling but it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a phase I went through when I was 16, but like, a girl is wearing it who looks just like me.\u2019 We\u2019re having a great time. We\u2019re all just chatting about life. That\u2019s gotta look weird.\u201d  Wearing her new-and-improved Junior Jewels shirt from the \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d video, she and director Joseph Kahn decide which Taylors will fight each other, which culminates in a hilarious scene where Fearless-era Taylor screams, \u201cI HATE YOU, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\u201d at Red-era Taylor. Even more fun than seeing the throwback costumes and the choreographed fight scenes, though, are the moments when the Taylor we know and love shines through. She jokes about being graceful! She names a falling technique after a cat! Maybe the \u201cold Taylor\u201d isn\u2019t so dead and gone after all.",

        "doc_2_text": "The Met Gala is a special time when every celebrity under the sun puts on a extravagant gown, looks fabulous, and talks about how fabulous their fellow celebs look, too. While I love checking out the themed fashion, there are often events outside of the clothes that make the event memorable. Remember elevatorgate? Yep, that happened after the 2014 Met Gala. At the 2016 event, Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston spent the night dancing together, and a summer fling followed that set the internet on fire. Now that a year has passed since that night of dancing, I wonder: Are Swift and Hiddleston still friends?  Before we get to that, let's do a quick recap of the history of their romance. According to Hiddleston, in an interview with the Press Association, he and Swift were seated at the same table during the 2016 Met Ball. She was there sans her boyfriend at the time, Calvin Harris, but asked Hiddleston for a friendly dance, which was eventually recorded and spread around the internet. About a month following the Met Gala, Harris and Swift announced their breakup. Then, in mid-June, photos of Hiddleston and Swift cuddling on a beach in Rhode Island were released and fans went wild.  After a whirlwind summer that included travels all over the world, Hiddles and Swift broke up around Labor Day 2016, the timing which was pretty much the textbook definition of a summer romance.  Now that it's been several months, what is Swift and Hiddleston's status? Based on what Hiddleston has shared about their romance, it sounds like there are fond memories and that they are still friendly, but not incredibly close, which is understandable.  In February 2017, Hiddleston opened up about Swift in a GQ profile. His first comment on her was just overwhelmingly sweet and he said,  \u201cTaylor is an amazing woman. She\u2019s generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time. Of course it was real.\u201d  Later in the interview he also explained that now-infamous 'I Love T.S.' tank top that he was spotted wearing during her annual Fourth of July party. Hiddleston continued on the subject of Swift,  \u201cI only know the woman I met. She\u2019s incredible. A relationship in the limelight\u2026 A relationship always takes work. A relationship in the limelight takes work. And it\u2019s not just the limelight. It\u2019s everything else.\"  While Hiddleston has sung Swift's praises post-breakup, she has kept very mum about their relationship and, well, everything. She hasn't explicitly commented on Hiddleston, so it's tough to know if they're actual friends or not. Hiddleston was spotted at an event with Ed Sheeran in early March 2017, which could hint that there is no \"bad blood\" in the friend group, considering Sheeran and Swift are very close.  It is tough to tell, but Hiddleston and Swift seem to have had an amicable breakup. I just wouldn't hang on to any hope for a reconciliation anytime soon.",

It could also be a nod to that time when Taylor made the following statement about the media:  \"Every single article had these descriptions of my personality that were very different from the actual personality and my first reaction was like, that's a bummer, this isn't fun for me. But then my second reaction ended up being like, hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about.

Love you @taylorswift  Fans swooned over the sweet message and left comments like, \"This is the cutest thing ever,\" \"I STAN THIS,\" \"my queens,\" and \"I love you both so much.\" There were some questions raised before Reputation came out as to whether or not Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez were still friends, but Swift cleared that up in the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video. At the end of the video, one of the \"old Taylors\" is wearing a T-shirt with the names of the people she loves written on it. Selena's name is right in plain sight, so yeah, they're good.  Gomez's birthday Instagram for Swift is seriously sweet.  And she's not the only celebrity who wished the singer a happy birthday yesterday.  HAIM, who opened for Swift on the 1989 tour, tweeted at Swift.  The tweet said, \"happy birthday @taylorswift grateful to have someone that shares the same love of most of the emo catalogue from 2003-2005.\"  YouTuber/singer/broadway star Todrick Hall posted a series of photos of him and Swift together.  His caption read, \"Happy Birthday @taylorswift LOVE YOU TONZ.\" Some of Hall's pictures were of him and Swift in the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video. Yes, he was in it.

She said, \"Happy birthday, @taylorswift13! Remember the first time you were here?\"  Ryan Seacrest also got Swift's cats involved in his birthday message.  He tweeted what looks like a boomerang of Swift handing her cat, Olivia, to him. The tweet said, \"Happy bday @taylorswift13! Enjoy today. If you need a cat sitter for Olivia, you know where to find me.\"  Ruby Rose also posted on Instagram to say happy birthday to her friend.  She posted a simple, \"Happy birthday magical unicorn!!!\"  And last but not least, Swift's buddy Martha Hunt posted a funny photo of the two of them goofing off.  She tweeted, \"Baby girl does not judge my funky chicken. HBD sis @taylorswift13.\"  One birthday post for Swift we didn't see was from her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. But he doesn't have social media, so we were obviously never going to see it in the first place. But what we did get to see was Swift and Alwyn cozy up at iHeartRadio's Jingle Ball last week.  Fans swooned when they saw Swift and Alwyn swaying and singing along while Ed Sheeran was on stage performing \"Perfect.\"  Then they freaked out even more when they saw Swift and Alwyn singing along while Sheeran performed \"Thinking Out Loud.\"  According to sources, Swift and Alwyn are planning on spending the holidays together. He's apparently also going on tour with her! A source told People that Alwyn might even be ~the one~. The source said,  It\u2019s a great relationship that everyone hopes will last. Joe could definitely be the one. Their relationship is very different from Taylor\u2019s past ones. Just like Taylor, Joe is a homebody. He loves being an actor but doesn\u2019t like the celebrity part of it. It\u2019s pretty special to find someone you\u2019re on the same page with.  Hope you're OK, Swifties!",

Instead, her music references \u201980s and \u201990s sounds in its own style of minimalist rock-pop: a little bit punk, a little bit rap-sung, and plenty of catchy melody for good measure. And the lyrics? As ever, Swift stays personal, as past lyrics have alluded to the headlines and personalities that have influenced her path through stardom.  Some super-fans have already listened to Reputation at private sessions hosted by Swift in London and her home in Rhode Island.

On the music front, Taylor Swift released her new song \"Gorgeous\" off of her upcoming album Reputation, her third single from the album following \"Look What You Made Me Do\" and \"Ready For It.\" The song is a mix of beat-forward electro-pop and references to the 80s and 90s. Some fans have already listened to the song at private sessions hosted by Swift, but the rest will have to wait until next month.",

But what if they were actually all about a fictional character instead? A corner of the Internet is convinced the lyrics actually tell the story of Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, and the idea makes a lot of sense, if you think about it.  Both Mashable and Entertainment Weekly broke down just how similar the lyrics are to Arya\u2019s character on the HBO show. And they really do reflect Arya\u2019s transformation from a little kid into a badass assassin with a list of grudges.  Just a few examples: \u201cI don\u2019t like your tilted stage/The role you made me play/Of the fool\u201d could be a reference to the actors in Braavos who put on a version of the Stark family\u2019s life\u2014and painted her father, Ned Stark as a buffoon. \u201cI don\u2019t like your kingdom keys/They once belonged to me\u201d could be a reference to Cersei Lannister, who rules the Seven Kingdoms after her family\u2019s treachery killed Ned, who was the hand of the king. \"You ask me for a place to sleep / Locked me out and threw a feast\" could be a reference to Walder Frey, who locked members of her family in his home for the Red Wedding massacre, while she was locked out. And of course, \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined/I check it once, then I check it twice\u201d could be a direct reference to Arya\u2019s list of people she intends to kill.  Clearly, Twitter took notice of this pretty quickly, and either lived for the comparison or rolled their eyes at the idea that a pop star like Taylor could be as ruthless as Arya. But who knows: Maybe Taylor is a huge Game of Thrones fan and sees herself in the girl who was wronged\u2014and who now wants to take down all her enemies.  View full post on X    And even the official Game of Thrones Twitter account acknowledged the idea. But given the snake imagery used to promote Taylor's new music, wouldn\u2019t she be more like a Sand Snake than a Stark, anyway?",

After their viral Met Gala dance-off, MTV UK interviewed Tom about Taylor in a video posted on May 16. (Taylor and Calvin announced their breakup on June 1, for reference.)  Just how many times did Tom compliment Taylor in 53-second segment? Four.  1. \"I sat next time to her at dinner that night, and she was very charming.\"  2. \"She is amazing.\"  3. \"I mean, I've seen a couple of her videos, and I think, I remember 'Shake It Off' was released around the time we made I Saw the Light. She's very cool, yeah.\"  4. When asked about doing a duet with her, \"I don't know that I could stand up to her vocal talents, to be honest. That's what she does. She's a professional musician and I'm an actor. We'll see. You never know. But I'm pretty sure we won't do it.\"  Right before Taylor and Calvin dated, for comparison, Calvin told an interviewer he would swipe left on her on Tinder because \"she looks lovely [but] she's the opposite of my type.\" Then, post-awards-show kisses/months later, he told a radio station Taylor checks off \"boxes I didn't even know existed.\"",

The theory makes sense, given the similarities between the lyrics and the character of Arya Stark. For example, the line \"I don't like your tilted stage/The role you made me play/Of the fool\" could be a reference to the actors in Braavos who put on a version of the Stark family's life, and the line \"I don't like your kingdom keys/They once belonged to me\" could be a reference to Cersei Lannister.\n\nTwitter users have been quick to notice the similarities and express their opinions on the matter.

Others are more skeptical, pointing out that the snake imagery used to promote Taylor's new music suggests that she is more like a Sand Snake than a Stark.\n\nOverall, it seems like Taylor Swift has a lot of admirers, both in the real world and in the virtual world.

June Steenkamp, speaking to the BBC World Service, said that Pistorius treated Reeva like \"his arm candy\" and tried to dictate what she wore, how she behaved and how she spoke prior to killing her on Valentine's Day in 2013.  Steenkamp described the time when Reeva, 29, called her during their three-month relationship to say that Pistorius was driving dangerously at 161mph with her in the car.  She said: \"One day she phoned me and said, 'Mummy, Oscar's driving like a lunatic.' And I said, 'Well, you just put him on the phone.'  \"And I said to him, 'if you hurt my baby, I will have you wiped out' - just trying to scare him. And apparently he slowed down straightaway.\"  Pistorius, a double-amputee Olympic sprinter, was convicted of culpable homicide on 12 September for which he received a maximum prison sentence of five years, with the possibility of serving the rest under correctional supervision after 10 months.  June and Barry Steenkamp, parents of Reeva, during the sentencing hearing of Oscar Pistorius at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria  Steenkamp said about sitting near him in the trial: \"That was scary. Because he was the one who killed her, and he hurt her and he terrorised her.  \"We all love our children and we adored Reeva. And to sit next to the person who killed her - and she didn't do anything and she had no protection - horrible.\"  Pistorius, 28, pleaded not guilty to murder and said that he mistook Reeva for an intruder in his bathroom before he shot four times through the door, with three bullets hitting his girlfriend.  Steenkamp, whose book Reeva: A Mother's Story is out in the UK, also said that her only child Reeva kept quiet about their relationship at the beginning as \"she wasn't sure if they were compatible\" and she told her mother that she could not understand why they were fighting so early on.  She said: \"She didn't tell me about Oscar - the first time I saw them together was on the red carpet at a sports award. And I thought: \"Now, who is this man?\" Because I'd never heard of him.\"  In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Show all 20 1 / 20 In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp listens to the testimony of Oscar Pistorius during his ongoing murder trial in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp looks on during the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius at the high court in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp (2nd L), Reeva Steenkamp's mother listens to Oscar Pistorius' testimony in the Pretoria High Court in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva, is comforted by unidentified relative after her dead daughter's picture was shown on screen during the trial of Oscar Pistorius at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp hides her face as she listens to Oscar Pistorius' testimony in the Pretoria High Court In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp, mother of the late Reeva Steenkamp listens to evidence by a pathologist during the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius in court in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp attends the trial on Souh African paralympian Oscar Pistorius before his murder trial was postponed at the high court in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Gina Myers in court Gina Myers, Reeva Steenkamp's best friend, is overcome with emotion as she listens to Oscar Pistorius' testimony in the Pretoria High Court In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Relatives of Reeva Steenkamp in court Relatives and friends of Reeva Steenkamp, Gina Meyers (C) and her mother Desiree (R) attend a hearing of Oscar Pistorius on the sixth day of his trial In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court Reeva Steenkamp's mother looks on inside the Pretoria High Court In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp (L), mother of the murdered Reeva Steenkamp, sits in court ahead of the trial of Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp in court June Steenkamp reacts as she awaits start of the first day of proceedings in court In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp arrives in court June Steenkamp (C), the mother of Reeva Steenkamp, arrives at North Gauteng High Court for the trial of Oscar Pistorius in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' June Steenkamp arrives in court June Steenkamp (R), the mother of Reeva Steenkamp, arrives at North Gauteng High Court for the trial of Oscar Pistorius in Pretoria In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Daily News front page day after the shooting Oscar Pistorius was arrested in South Africa in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Reeva Steenkamp Reeva Steenkamp in a publicity shot for Tropika Island of Treasure AP In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Reeva Steenkamp Reeva Steenkamp cooks Getty Images In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Reeva Steenkamp The model was shot four times by Oscar Pistorius AP In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Reeva Steenkamp Reeva Steenkamp, girlfriend of Oscar Pistorius GETTY IMAGES In pictures: June Steenkamp's 'court hell' Reeva Steenkamp Reeva Steenkamp who was shot dead on the Valentine's Day 2013  Reeva moved from her parents' home in Port Elizabeth aged 22 to the bigger and more dangerous South African city of Johannesburg to continue a successful career in modelling - which she had done since the age of 14 - after graduating with a law degree and working as a paralegal.

(Video: Natalie Jennings, Bastien Inzaurralde, Alice Li/The Washington Post, Photo: Susan Walsh/The Washington Post)  Share Add to your saved stories Save  President Trump ripped into a federal judge's decision to temporarily block enforcement of his controversial travel ban, sending tweets throughout the day. \u201cWhen a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security \u2014 big trouble!\u201d Trump posted on Twitter early Saturday morning.  He also appeared to question the legitimacy of the federal judge who issued the ruling.  \u201cThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump tweeted.  The tweets came hours after a federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked enforcement of Trump\u2019s ban on entry to the United States for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and refugees from around the world.  Advertisement  U.S. District Judge James L. Robart wrote in his opinion that \u201cfundamental\u201d to the court\u2019s work was \u201ca vigilant recognition that it is but one of three equal branches of our federal government.\u201d  Robart, a judge appointed by George W. Bush, said in his written order that U.S. officials should stop enforcing the key aspects of the ban: the halting of entry by citizens from certain countries and by refugees from around the world. He did not specifically address the matter of those whose visas already had been revoked.  Following the Friday-night ruling, government authorities immediately began communicating with airlines and taking steps that would allow travel by those previously barred from doing so, according to a U.S. official.  At the same time, though, the White House said in a statement that the Justice Department would \u201cat the earliest possible time\u201d file for an emergency stay of the \u201coutrageous\u201d ruling from the judge. Minutes later, it issued a similar statement omitting the word \u201coutrageous.\u201d  \u201cThe president\u2019s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\u201d the White House said.  Advertisement  Trump signed orders on Jan. 27 not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \u201cnew vetting measures\u201d to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 is suspended for 90 days. Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees over those of other religions, according to the Christian Broadcasting Network.  Hours after it was signed, Trump's executive order sparked massive protests at airports across the country, as reports surfaced that dozens of travelers from the affected countries, including green-card holders, were being detained.  Share this article Share  The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit the following day challenging Trump\u2019s order after two Iraqi men with immigrant visas were barred from entering the United States at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Within hours, federal judge Ann M. Donnelly issued a stay to stop the deportations nationwide, noting there was a strong likelihood the order had violated the petitioners' rights to due process and equal protection by the Constitution.  Travelers affected by ban begin to arrive in U.S. after Trump order is suspended + 22 After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.  Since then, the travel ban has evolved as Trump's administration has attempted to clarify exceptions to the order. The Department of Homeland Security said the ban would not apply to permanent residents or green-card holders, dual citizens who carry a passport from somewhere other than one of the banned countries and those with NATO or U.N. visas.  Advertisement  Robart's ruling Friday, which was broader than similar ones before it, sets up a high-stakes legal confrontation between the new president and the judicial branch.  The ruling is temporary, and the ultimate question of whether Trump\u2019s executive order will pass constitutional muster will fall to higher-level courts. Legal analysts have said the ban could be difficult to permanently undo because the president has broad authority to set immigration policy.  Later Saturday morning, the State Department announced it would reverse its visa revocations, allowing previously banned travelers to enter the United States.  Trump, presumably responding to the latest development, resumed tweeting his displeasure hours later.  And then again, an hour later:  Though his tweet implied that \u201canyone\u201d could now come into the United States, the State Department's announcement applied to travelers from those countries who already held valid visas.  Advertisement  \u201cThose individuals with visas that were not physically canceled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid,\u201d a State Department spokesman said Saturday, adding that Department of Homeland Security personnel \u201cwill resume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy and procedure.\u201d  Matt Zapotosky, Lori Aratani and Justin Jouvenal contributed to this article.

After spending over 20 years separated behind bars, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of killing their parents after notorious trials in the 1990s, are finally being housed at the same prison -- and their reunion was an emotional one.  Until this week, the last time Lyle and Erik Menendez saw each other was Sept. 10, 1996, said Robert Rand, a journalist who has covered the case since 1989 and was a consultant for NBC's 2017 TV series on the brothers.  The Menendez brothers: A look at their childhood, the murder, the trial 1 of 15 Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez at their Beverly Hills mansion. Erik, left, and Lyle, right, are pictured in this undated photo together with their father Jose, who was a successful Cuban-American business executive. Before the wealthy family moved to Beverly Hills, the Menendez brothers grew up in an affluent neighborhood of Princeton, New Jersey. Brian Andersen  That day in 1996, the brothers could see each other across prison a yard but couldn't talk to each other; they had hoped to be placed in the same prison but were put in separate vans, which took them to separate facilities, Rand told ABC News.  While in separate prisons, they couldn't talk on the phone, but they did write letters to each other and would play chess by sending moves to each other through snail mail, Rand said. And while behind bars both brothers found wives: Erik has been married for 20 years and Lyle for 14, Rand said.  This Wednesday, after decades apart, the brothers finally came face to face at R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.  An undated image from Google Maps shows the San Diego's R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility.  Rand, who is still in touch with the Menendez family, said a family member told him that as guards led Lyle down a hallway to see Erik, Lyle \"was surprised he wasn't feeling more emotional.\"  But once the guard opened the door and Lyle saw his brother, both Lyle and Erik \"burst into tears immediately,\" Rand said.  An Oct. 31, 2016 photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Erik Menendez (L) and a Feb. 22, 2018 photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Lyle Menendez. The Menendez brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion nearly three decades ago, have been reunited in the Southern California prison San Diego's R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility.  \"They just hugged each other for a few minutes without saying any words to each other,\" Rand said. \"Then the prison officials let them spend an hour together in a room.\"  Jose and Kitty Menendez are seen here in this undated family photo.  Their story began on Aug. 20, 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, then 18, opened fire on their wealthy parents inside the family\u2019s Beverly Hills mansion, using shotguns they bought days before the murders.  Their father, Jose Menendez, a successful Cuban-American business executive, was shot point-blank in the head. Their mother, Kitty Menendez, was shot several times in her torso and face.  Authorities arrested the brothers in 1990 after their psychologist\u2019s girlfriend went to police claiming Erik had confessed the murders to the psychologist during a session and Lyle had threatened the doctor\u2019s life, thus voiding doctor-patient privilege.  In this file photo, brothers Erik Menendez and Lyle Menendez listen to a charge of murder conspiracy against them, Dec. 29, 1992, in Los Angeles. The brothers pled innocent to the new indictment which dropped the original charge that they killed their parents for money. The indictment was returned nearly three years after Joseph and Kitty Menendez were found slain in their home.  At trial, prosecutors alleged that the brothers, who lived a life of privilege, murdered their parents out of greed, hoping to get their hands on the family fortune. The defense argued the brothers\u2019 acted in self-defense after years enduring their parents\u2019 abuse.  In this file photo, Lyle Menendez looks back at the spectators in the courtroom during final arguments in the second murder trial of Lyle and his brother Erik in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles, Feb. 22, 1996. For the second time in as many days, final arguments prompted a motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor's suggestion there wasn't enough evidence to show the brothers were abused by their parents.  Erik Menendez gestures during lengthy testimony in Van Nuys courthouse in Los Angeles, Jan. 4, 1996, in this file photo. He and his brother Lyle are being retried for the 1989 murder of their parents in Beverly Hills, Calif.  Their first trials ended in mistrials, but at the end of a second trial in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole.  Erik, left, and Lyle Menendez are seen here as a young men in this undated family photo.  Their reunion began when Lyle was transferred from Northern California's Mule Creek State Prison to San Diego's R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in February 2018, corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton told ABC News.  Erik had been at this San Diego facility since July 2013, she said.  But when Lyle was transferred in February, they were housed in different sections so they could not interact, Thornton said. On April 4, Eric was transferred to Lyle's housing facility within that prison, and in that facility, all the inmates have the ability to interact with one another, she said.  They can now see each other every day at meals and in the exercise yard, Rand said.  Rand said the last few years Lyle told him that he \"missed his brother so much. And Erik had also talked about how much he missed Lyle. So this is just an overwhelming, emotional, happy moment for not only the brothers but their entire family.\"",

Jennifer's seven-year-old nephew Julian King, the son of her elder sister Julia Hudson, was initially reported missing and an AMBER Alert was issued; Julian King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description.[2] Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to \"multiple gunshot wounds.\"[3] A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police.[4]  Investigation [ edit ]  On the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Chicago police took Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 27, into custody and he confessed .[5] Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.[1]  After the Chicago police had held Balfour for the maximum 48 hours allowable without charging him with a crime, he was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation.[5] At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred.[5] Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.[5]  Montes said that the allegations from the woman included that Balfour had admitted to her that he was involved in the murders, but those allegations were not part of the parole review hearing.[6] Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime.[5]  Arrest and Conviction [ edit ]  On December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion.[7] At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man.[8] Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes.[7] Balfour was indicted on December 30.[9] On January 20, 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges.[10] He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.  Legacy [ edit ]  In the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation \"to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,\" according to a statement released to the press.[11]",

His body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description. Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to \"multiple gunshot wounds.\" A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police.\n\nOn the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour was taken into custody and he confessed to the murders. Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking, and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.\n\nAfter being held for the maximum 48 hours without charging him with a crime, Balfour was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation. At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred. Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.\n\nBalfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion on December 1, 2008. At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man. Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes. Balfour was indicted on December 30 and he pleaded not guilty to all charges on January 20, 2009. He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.\n\nIn the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation \"to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,\" according to a statement released to the press.\n\nOn the other side of the world, South African Paralympic gold medallist Oscar Pistorius was taken to hospital on Thursday after falling ill and was kept at the medical facility overnight for observation. Last August, Pistorius denied trying to kill himself after he was treated in hospital for wrist injuries. The athlete was sentenced to six years in prison in July last year after being found guilty of murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day 2013.",

        "doc_1_text": "Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for \u201ctraditional values.\u201d Offred is not the narrator\u2019s real name\u2014Handmaid names consist of the word \u201cof\u201d followed by the name of the Handmaid\u2019s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have ritualized sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred\u2019s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead\u2019s secret police force, watch her every public move.  As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. Luke divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred\u2019s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred\u2019s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women\u2014when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women\u2019s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.  After her capture, Offred\u2019s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead\u2019s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead\u2019s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.  Once Offred is assigned to the Commander\u2019s house, her life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the \u201cCeremony,\u201d in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where Serena and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.  The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky\u2014she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.  During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of \u201cMayday,\u201d an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t make an omelette without breaking eggs.\u201d  After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander\u2019s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes with horror that Serena has always known where her daughter was. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel\u2019s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel\u2019s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and others who pose a threat to Gilead are sent. After that night at Jezebel\u2019s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.  Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel\u2019s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick\u2019s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone\u2019s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen\u2019s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.  Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred\u2019s trip to Jezebel\u2019s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander\u2019s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom\u2014she does not know which.",

Erik Menendez, 47, was transferred to 50-year-old Lyle Menendez\u2019s designated section at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, online records show.  The brothers last saw each other in 1996, when they were found guilty of murdering their father Jose and mother Kitty as they watched TV inside their $5 million estate in Beverly Hills on Aug. 20, 1989.  Authorities said they shot Jose Menendez several times in the head. Initially, their mother was only wounded.  But when she tried to crawl away, Lyle Menendez reloaded his shotgun and shot his mother several more times, officials said.  The brothers claimed they killed their parents after enduring years of abuse, but prosecutors argued they wanted access to their parents\u2019 millions. They were each found guilty of two counts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Lyle Menendez reportedly asked to be moved closer to his brother during his last hearing on his inmate classification status. He was then transferred from Mule Creek State Prison in Northern California to the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego on Feb. 22.  Erik was then moved to the same unit as his brother Wednesday.  \"He had been asking for it, and the department could find no reason they could not be at the same prison,\" Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections, told the New York Daily News. \u201cThere are people who are related who may also be crime partners, and it's not unprecedented for them to be living in the same prison or even sharing the same cell.\"  The brothers, who are believed to have kept in contact only through letters, will now be able to spend time together at meals, during recreational periods and while exercising.  Tammi Menendez, who married Erik three years after his sentencing, told TheBlast.com that her husband is \"settling in\" and described the brothers' reunion as \"heartfelt.\"  RELATED STORIES",

The former \"Baywatch\" actress has frequently been photographed visiting Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he's been living in exile since 2012 in an effort to avoid bail violation charges in the UK and extradition to the US, where he's wanted to leaking classified documents.  At the end of March, the embassy revealed that it had revoked Assange's visitor privileges and access to the internet because he went against \"a written [agreement] not to issue messages that might interfere with other states.\"  Reacting to the news, Anderson released a statement to the New York Post expressing her disapproval of the embassy's latest move.  SEE ALSO: Vanessa Trump 'went gangster' on Aubrey O'Day after learning about alleged Donald Trump Jr. affair: Report  \"I'm deeply concerned about his health and well-being,\" the actress said. \"His human rights have been abused before without sunlight, but this is extraordinary. Incommunicado. No visitors. No internet. No phone calls. No access to outside world. This is torture -- a slow, painful death [at] the hands of the US [and] UK. I feel for Ecuador.

We are all Julian Assange.\"  With her visits to Assange suddenly halted, Anderson is once again drumming up speculation around the nature of her relationship with the controversial figure. Though the actress has been dating 32-year-old soccer star Adil Rami since 2017, it's unclear whether or not that romance is exclusive.  \"I don't want to say anything about whether there's a romance,\" Anderson once told Grazia of her relationship with Assange. \"So, let's say we're just 'good friends.'\"  Sources close to the WikiLeaks founder say that he has a \"deep crush\" on the actress because \"she's just out of reach.\"  \"Julian has a thing for blondes and he's always been quite the womanizer,\" a source told Page Six. \"But Pam's much more intelligent than most women with that kind of look -- she's no bimbo.\"  Assange has reportedly \"had a lot of so-called 'girlfriends' visit him there before Pam,\" but \"they were the kind of groupies who fall for men in prison.\"  Though neither has done much to quell rumors of a romance between them, sources familiar with the \"Baywatch\" actress question her motives in getting involved with Assange and her highly-photographed visits to see him.  \"Pam thrives on attention from famous men, and she thrives on press,\" one source said. \"It's no accident she shows up to the embassy in those sexy outfits. They are all very contrived.\"  Indeed, the outfits that Anderson has worn to visit Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy are always glamorous, often skin-baring and definitely thought-out. The paparazzi are frequently already there catching her enter and exit the property, often carrying bags full of food.  See photos of Julian Assange:    \"She needs to stay in the public eye,\" another source added. \"She doesn't have enough money to be a full-time philanthropist. [...] It's not like she's on TV or movies recently. And she's got expensive taste. That look doesn't come cheap at age 50.\"  Designer Vivienne Westwood reportedly first introduced the unlikely pair back in 2014, after having been a fan and friend to both. (Westwood regularly visited Assange at the embassy before the visitor ban. Other past visitors have included Lady Gaga, Maggie Gyllenhall and John Cusack.)  \"She loves Pam and knew they'd have mutual interests,\" a former employee of the designer told Page Six. \"She didn't introduce them as a proper setup. But Viv does fantasize that he and Pam would really be together.

The five-member panel concluded that Burke Ramsey, then 9 years old, accidentally killed his sister in a fit of rage over either a toy or a pineapple. Twitter took special interest in the pineapple theory.  \u201cStill don\u2019t definitively know who killed #JonBenet but my question is, who tf eats a bowl of pineapple with milk?! #ThatsCrazy,\u201d said one twitterer.  \u201cIf having pizza with Burke Ramsey make sure you get him the Hawaiian. Guy would kill for some pineapple. #thecaseofjonbenet #JonBenet,\u201d joked another.  Uproar over the pineapple stems from a bowl filled with pineapple and milk found on a table by investigators, who said autopsy results revealed partially-digested pineapple in JonBenet\u2019s stomach. Theory holds that Burke was eating the pineapple when his sister swiped some, and then he struck her with a flashlight in a fit of rage, accidentally killing her. The theory also maintains that parents John and Patsy Ramsey covered up the incident.  The investigators also revealed that Burke had hit JonBenet with a golf club a year earlier after \u201closing his temper.\u201d  Naturally, there were those who wanted to believe.  \u201c@CBS I really believe your team solved the murder. #Burke killed his sister.

However, there were those who felt no closer to closure than they did before the series aired.  \u201cSo the A&E documentary and CBS mini series on JonBenet Ramsey basically contradict each other,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.  \u201comg wtf ~one documentary convinced me it was an intruder + another documentary convinced me it was her brother,\u201d tweeted another, understandably perplexed.

        "doc_2_text": "Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately \u2014 not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the \u201ccrazy and manipulative\u201d estranged wife who has become increasingly \u201cunpopular in Hollywood.\u201d She\u2019s \u201cout for blood\u201d in the divorce fight, or she \u201cwants to embarrass and punish\u201d the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed \u201can insane jealousy\u201d jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes \u201cAmal has stolen her identity\u201d as the world\u2019s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency\u2019s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children \u2014 girls especially \u2014 whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can\u2019t read or write and has been \u201crobbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.\u201d  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university \u2014 while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  \u201cThere are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,\u201d Jolie wrote. \u201cThere are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.\u201d  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: \u201cNot with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.\u201d  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  \u201cHardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,\u201d Jolie wrote. \u201cIt is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.\u201d  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a \u201cpatient, long-term manner, guided by our values.\u201d She concluded her piece by writing: \u201cIf we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.\u201d",
        "generated_text": "In recent times, Angelina Jolie has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt has taken a dark turn, with the actress being accused of being \"crazy and manipulative\" and \"out for blood\" in the divorce fight. Jolie has also been portrayed in court papers as a deadbeat dad by the actor, which has led to a family law judge suggesting that she may be trying to undercut her relationship with their children.\n\nAdditionally, Page Six reported that Jolie had developed an \"insane jealousy\" of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes that Amal has stolen her identity as the world's most glamorous and admired humanitarian, according to a source close to the actress.\n\nDespite all of these negative headlines, Jolie reminded the world of her world-class humanitarian credentials when she published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency's efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children. The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given the recent headlines about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.\n\nIn her piece, Jolie shared moving accounts of what education means to children, particularly girls, whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war. She wrote that there are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries.\n\nJolie also argued that wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war by providing education and other resources. She stated that it is important to help refugees in a \"patient, long-term manner, guided by our values.\"\n\nJolie's message is clear: if we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.",

But the boy from Bristol also harbored demons of the sort that would one day lead him to drugs, accusations of cold-blooded murder and, finally, his own death. Authorities said he hanged himself with a bed sheet early Wednesday in the prison cell where he was serving a life sentence without possibility of parole. He was 27 and had lived an operatic hybrid of American dream and ghastly nightmare. His death came the same day his former team visited the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory two months ago.  Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl in early 2012 \u2013 and the next year found himself accused of killing a semipro football player, Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Motive remains unclear, though it may have been that Lloyd had some knowledge of Hernandez\u2019s link to a double homicide in the summer of 2012.  Last week, Hernandez was acquitted of the most serious charges in that case, which would have only added to his life sentence because Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Though, in the end, Hernandez apparently imposed his own.  MORE COVERAGE:  NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.  Mass. Appeals Court likely to vacate Aaron Hernandez's murder conviction  Aaron Hernandez lawyer: 'Determined to find truth ... about untimely death'  Armchair psychologists will long speculate what took Hernandez from a top target for Tim Tebow in college football to a top target for Tom Brady in the NFL and from there to a dark side of malevolent violence and unfathomable anger. Answers are ultimately unknowable but clues abound, beginning with the unexpected death of his father in 2006 when Hernandez was 16.  Dennis Hernandez was a high school custodian who died of complications arising from routine hernia surgery. The aftermath \u201cwas a mess with a lot of family issues, fighting and disagreements,\u201d Hernandez told USA TODAY Sports in 2009, when he was playing at Florida.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do for him,\u201d his mother Terri said in the same story. \u201cHe would rebel. It was very, very hard, and he was very, very angry. He wasn\u2019t the same kid, the way he spoke to me. The shock of losing his dad, there was so much anger.\u201d  Trouble 'finds this guy'  Hernandez was an honor student at Bristol Central High School, though Doug Pina, his high school coach, told the Hartford Courant in 2010 that he\u2019d personally \u201calways had concerns\u201d about him.  Hernandez had originally planned to play college football for Connecticut, where his father and older brother played, but changed his mind and chose Florida. Before his first college game, Hernandez, then 17, punched a restaurant manager in the side of the head, busting his eardrum in a dispute over the bill. The case apparently settled out of court.  Hernandez also was among several Gators players interviewed by police after a shooting at a nightclub that left two men wounded. No one was ever charged.  Hernandez won a national championship and the John Mackey Award for the nation\u2019s best tight end during his time at Florida. He declared for the 2010 NFL draft where the Patriots took him in the fourth round, lower than his talent suggested he\u2019d go, apparently because of multiple failed drug tests and unsavory friends. CBSSports.com quoted an unnamed NFL scout: \u201cWe stayed away because we hated the people he hung out with and how trouble always finds this guy.\u201d  MORE COVERAGE:  Aaron Hernandez: How he spent his four years in prison since murder conviction  Aaron Hernandez's death brings chilling end to tragic story  Aaron Hernandez: What we know on day of his death  Published reports at the time said Hernandez had told teams at the NFL scouting combine that he\u2019d begun using marijuana to cope with the death of his father.  \u201cWho do I talk to?\u201d Hernandez said of the uncertainty after his father\u2019s death in that 2009 USA TODAY Sports story. \u201cWho do I hang with?\u201d  He often hung with a bad crowd in years to come, including Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. Rolling Stone styled them as \u201ctwo stumble-bum crooks with long sheets of priors.\u201d Wallace and Ortiz were with Hernandez when Lloyd was killed near Hernandez\u2019s Massachusetts home in 2013.  Family relationships were often complicated. Hernandez\u2019s cousin Tanya married Jeffrey Cummings in 2005; they had a son together and got divorced. Then, in 2009, Cummings married Hernandez\u2019s mother on a trip to Las Vegas. A year later, about a month before Hernandez reported to his first Patriots\u2019 training camp, Cummings slashed Hernandez\u2019s mother with a knife and she had lacerations to her face, shoulder and wrist. Cummings would wind up in jail and they would divorce.  Hernandez married Shayanna Jenkins in 2012 in the same month their daughter was born. That came only months after two Cape Verdean immigrants were gunned down in their car drive-by style after one of them bumped into Hernandez at a nightclub and spilled his drink.  Alexander Bradley would say at trial that it was Hernandez who shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado \u2013 and Hernandez\u2019s lawyers would say it was Bradley who shot them. Bradley, not incidentally, had filed a civil suit in 2013 alleging that Hernandez shot him point-blank in the face months earlier, costing him his right eye. They were best friends before they were mortal enemies.  Tattoos tell story  Last week, Hernandez wept after he was acquitted. It seemed out of character for a man who so often seemed devoid of any emotion. Reports at the time of his father\u2019s funeral said that Hernandez didn\u2019t cry, even as his brother and so many others did.  \u201cThere was such hunger in that kid for a father\u2019s hand, and such greatness itching to get out,\u201d Rolling Stone\u2019s story said after Hernandez\u2019s arrest in 2013, \u201cthat coach after coach had covered for him whenever the bad Aaron showed \u2014 the violent, furious kid who was dangerous to all, most particularly, it seems, to his friends.\u201d  Kelly Whiteside wrote in her 2009 story in USA TODAY Sports that a guided tour of the tattoos on Hernandez\u2019s body reads like his autobiography.  Starting from his right shoulder, she wrote, \u201cthere was a tattoo representing God\u2019s hands, a nod to his big brother and to his father and the day he died. There\u2019s the sun representing all the good days he had with his dad. Beneath those rays are clouds and rain.\u201d  Hernandez then pointed to the angels near his wrist. \u201cIt all ends in heaven,\u201d he said.  He\u2019d add more tattoos in the years ahead. One was of a smoking semi-automatic pistol. Another was of a six-shot revolver. That one accompanies two words, written in reverse: \u201cGod Forgives.\u201d  PHOTOS: Aaron Hernandez's life",

        "doc_2_text": "This year has been a pretty wild one already, but it just got stranger.  Kim Kardashian West -- like, beauty mogul and reigning queen of reality TV Kim Kardashian West -- visited the White House on Wednesday to talk about prison reform with President Donald Trump.  Trump tweeted this painful photo after the meeting:  Naturally, the photo quickly became a meme on Twitter, because how were there two reality TV stars in the Oval Office?  The meeting took place after months of discussion between Kardashian and Jared Kushner, according to Vanity Fair. Kardashian asked the president to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.  Before the meeting, Kardashian tweeted a birthday message for Johnson.  But people on Twitter just couldn't believe that this was actually happening.  Apparently prison reform hits home for Kushner, who has firsthand experience with an incarcerated family member after his father Charles was charged with tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering. Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.  The young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.  Since the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.  Kardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.  She also shared a tweet about a man who was sentenced to only 90 days of house arrest after raping a child.  Kardashian has also hinted at political aspirations. In an unaired clip from Khloe and Lamar, she pondered running for mayor of Glendale, a town in the greater Los Angeles area, because of its prominent Armenian population. (It's worth noting that Glendale doesn't have mayoral elections -- instead, its city council appoints a member to serve as mayor for one year.) Despite her past misinformation about the town's bureaucratic structure, it's possible that she used this meeting to sow seeds for future political gain.  Kardashian hasn't made a public statement about the meeting yet, aside from tweeting the birthday message for Alice Marie Johnson. Is there a chance we'll get to see a behind the scenes of the meeting on the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians? Possibly -- although season 15 doesn't have a premiere date yet. A Variety report revealed that the Kardashian/Jenner/West empire milked a deal with E! that will keep them on the air until 2020.",

The Canadian-American actress, 51, said Assange is one of her favorite people in an interview with Harvey Levin that aired on Fox News on Sunday night.  Describing him as 'imperfect', the former Baywatch star said: 'He's definitely an interesting person and there's definitely a romantic kind of connection 'cause it's a romantic struggle.  'We have this closeness\u2026 he's not close to people like he is to me.'  Scroll down for video  Pamela Anderson spoke of her 'romantic' connection with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in an interview that aired on Sunday night  Anderson, who is in a relationship with French footballer Adil Rami, said she had first met Assange to figure out how to be a 'more effective' activist \u2013 and brought him vegan food.  Since then, she says she has visited Assange a number of times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  'Now it's a tradition that I bring him vegan food every time I see him, and I see him a lot,' she added.  They have deep conversations about everything from the Bible to animal rights and jealousy, she said.  Now, the pair are planning to work together to create 'career activists' by choosing 10 activists from across the globe and pay their salaries for 10 years, she said.  Anderson says she has visited Assange a number of times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London (above)  She previously spoke about her concerns for Assange's health and well-being after Ecuador announced it had taken away Assange's Internet access and visitor privileges.  The Australian was undergoing 'a slow, painful death' at the hands of the US and UK, Anderson told the New York Post in March.  Last month, Ecuador's president said it was in talks with Britain over Assange's fate.  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum.  'The issue of Mr. Assange is being treated with the British government and I understand that we have already established contact with Mr. Assange's lawyers so we can find a way out,' Ecuador President Lenin Moreno told Spanish daily newspaper El Pais.  Anderson, who is in a relationship with French footballer Adil Rami, said she had first met Assange to figure out how to be a 'more effective' activist  'Mr. Assange has been in this situation for over five years and we have to find a way out for him.  'A way out that defends his rights, mainly his right to life, and which at the same time can give Ecuador the possibility to not have what, without a doubt, represents a problem for our country.'  Assange, 47, sought refuge in Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations, which he denies.  The Australian computer programmer claims the accusations were politically motivated and could lead to his extradition to the United States to face imprisonment over WikiLeaks's publication of secret US military documents and diplomatic cables in 2010.  Assange has been holed up at Ecuador's embassy in London since 2012 when he was granted political asylum  Swedish authorities dropped their investigations last year, but British authorities still want to arrest him for breaching bail conditions.  US intelligence agencies have also concluded that WikiLeaks co-ordinated with Russian intelligence to release hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election campaign.  Last year, Attorney General Jeff said arresting Assange was a 'priority.'  In March, Ecuador cut off Assange's ability to communicate with the outside world after he broke a 2017 promise to not interfere in other countries' affairs while in the mission.  Assange particularly drew the ire of Ecuador by angering the Spanish government with his support for separatist leaders in Spain's Catalonia region who sought to secede last year.  Moreno said the 'ideal' solution would involve Assange accepting a 'penalty' for having breached British bail conditions and then be 'extradited to a country where he does not face any danger.'",

Advertisement  \u201cI\u2019m hoping that through this Letterman show that (my classmates and friends) will be more aware of the things that happened back in Iraq,\u201d Avdal told the Tribune.  Avdal, 23, grew up as part of the Yazidi religious minority in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq. He graduated high school in 2013 and was accepted to the University of Mosul but was unable to begin his studies because al-Qaeda violence against Yazidis made Mosul unsafe. In 2014, the Islamic State, or ISIS, began the Yazidi genocide.  Advertisement  Thousands of Yazidis were massacred or kidnapped. Women were turned into sex slaves, while children were separated from their families and forced to convert to Islam.  Avdal told the Tribune he was working about six hours from his hometown when the attacks began. He said his family escaped just minutes before ISIS arrived. They went to a refugee camp in Turkey. His mother now lives in Germany, while other relatives are still in Iraq. Avdal\u2019s father died when he was a young boy.  Avdal ended up working in Iraq for Yazda, an organization devoted to supporting the Yazidi community in the aftermath of the genocide. A self-taught programmer, Avdal designed and programmed database management software that helped the organization manage its clients \u2014 hundreds of Yazidi women rescued from sexual enslavement.  It is through this organization that Avdal connected with Amal Clooney, an international human-rights lawyer who represents Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman who survived enslavement. Avdal said he met Clooney at a ceremony for Murad when she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations in September 2016.  \u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege of representing a number of Yazidis who have been the victims of genocide perpetrated by ISIS over the last couple of years; that\u2019s how I met Hazim,\u201d Amal Clooney told Letterman on his show. \u201cAnd when I met him, I remember being so struck by his courage but also just this amazing spirit and how he spoke about, even after everything he lost, he spoke about a desire for justice, not revenge.\u201d  Avdal also met Matthew Barber, a University of Chicago doctoral student focused on Islamic thought and Syrian and Iraqi history. Barber, the former executive director for Yazda in Iraq, talked up the University of Chicago to Avdal while they worked together for a year. Barber, meanwhile, worked behind the scenes with George Clooney to try to get Avdal into the school.  Yazidi refugee Hazim Avdal, left, is pictured on the day in May 2017 he found out he was admitted to the University of Chicago. (Courtesy of Matthew Barber / Handout)  \u201cI was really impressed with his character and his work ethic when I was there, but also his intelligence,\u201d Barber told the Tribune. \u201cIraq has a standardized high school examination that\u2019s given to all graduating seniors from high school. \u2026 The year that Hazim graduated from high school, he was the seventh-highest-scoring student in the whole country of Iraq.\u201d  Avdal found out he was accepted to the University of Chicago in May 2017 during a visit to the admissions office. Barber said Avdal buried his face in his hands and couldn\u2019t speak for several minutes.  Advertisement  Barber and one of George Clooney\u2019s cousins helped move Avdal into his dorm in September before he began classes. During breaks and holidays, Avdal stays at Clooney\u2019s home near the Oscar winner\u2019s parents in their hometown of Augusta, Ky. Avdal gave Letterman a tour of the home for his show.  Avdal has mixed feelings about appearing on Letterman\u2019s show since it will affect his anonymity. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published in September, George Clooney mentioned he and Amal took in a Yazidi refugee who was attending the University of Chicago, but Avdal was not named.  \u201cI want people to know about what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world, particularly in my experience, what happened in my part of the world,\u201d Avdal told the Tribune. \u201cOn the other hand, I also want to live my life as a student here at the University of Chicago, just quiet and have my own privacy. So it\u2019s like a trade-off. I will have to find a way to make a balance after (Letterman\u2019s) show comes out.\u201d  Avdal is too busy with his studies to think about potential fame. He plans to graduate with the class of 2021 and do \u201csomething meaningful\u201d that would make a difference in Iraq. Barber said thousands of Yazidis whose homes and villages were destroyed by ISIS are still waiting for reconstruction support, while survivors of the genocide and enslavement are trying to put their lives back together.  Avdal is also still settling into his new life in Chicago.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big city. I\u2019m a small-town boy. This kind of environment is kind of new to me. The weather is crazy cold. Where I grew up it was warmer and more quiet,\u201d Avdal said. \u201cIt was a little bit hard at the beginning, but now I love it.\u201d  Advertisement  tswartz@tribpub.com  Twitter @tracyswartz  [ Documentary that follows Syrian family resettling in Chicago to air on WTTW ]  [ Chelsea Handler headlining Chicago fundraiser for Syrian refugee programs ]  [ John Stamos kept a piece of Chicago history from his 'ER' days ]",

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  1/7/2013: Related Story: Four Women Found Shot To Death In Tulsa Apartment, 3-Year-Old Unharmed Inside  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a \"lick\" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  1/11/2013 Related Story: Person Of Interest Located, Questioned In Tulsa Quadruple Homicide  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  1/8/2013 Related Story: Tulsa Police ID Four Women Killed At Fairmont Terrace Apartments    Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    \"The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.\"  \"We can now get to the essence of this issue and that is much bigger than crime, it's about poverty. We're moving forward on our mission to establish a method to hold out-of-state apartment owners accountable for safe, secure and peaceful places to live. We continue to look down every possible avenue on how we can improve our city.\"",

On Tuesday, a Massachusetts judge overturned Hernandez's murder conviction per state law, because he died before he exhausted the appeals process. The decision could open the door for Hernandez's former team, the New England Patriots, to issue payments to his family. The former football star signed a $40 million contract extension with the team in 2012, though the Patriots denied him a signing bonus payment after he was arrested for the murder of Lloyd in 2013.

Daniel Kerrigan, 70, became known to the world when he carried his injured, sobbing daughter after a vicious attack at a skating competition nearly derailed her Olympic dreams in 1994.  Nancy\u2019s brother Mark, 45, was charged with assault after he admitted locking his hands around his father\u2019s throat in an early-morning melee over use of the telephone in the house they share in Stoneham, Mass., authorities said.  Cops said he thought his dad was only pretending to be hurt when he fell to the floor.  Charges against the son could be upgraded after the release of autopsy results that will determine the cause of death.  The skater\u2019s legally blind mother, Brenda, said that he had suffered a massive heart attack, but officials have not confirmed that. Other family members \u2014 who were not present for the attack \u2014 insisted his death was not related to the fight.  \u201cThe present charges are based on the facts as we presently know them,\u201d said local district attorney Gerard Leone.  \u201cAny further charging developments will be based in large measure upon a reliance on the final opinion issued by the Chief Medical Examiner regarding the cause and manner of death of the decedent.\u201d  The fight happened in Nancy Kerrigan\u2019s childhood home, where she first dreamed of Olympic stardom.  She was a self-described tomboy with two hockey-playing big brothers until her parents began to nurture her love of figure skating  Daniel Kerrigan, a welder, drove a Zamboni ice-cleaning machine at the local rink in exchange for her practice time on the ice, and the parents took out a second mortgage on their home to help pay for her skating lessons.  Nancy, who still skates at exhibitions, was spotted yesterday enter- ing the bright yellow house on Cedar Avenue, hours after an emergency crew carried her father out.  Her pained expression contrasted with the electric smile that warmed fans all over the world after she pirouetted her way to Olympic eminence, winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Games.  She got a silver medal at the Olympics two years later in Lillehammer, Norway.  But before her second appearance, rival skater Tonya Harding hired a goon to attack her during an Olympic qualifying session.  He whacked her with a collapsible baton just above her right knee. The attacker was jailed, Harding paid a $150,000 fine and Kerrigan recovered completely.  \u201cI hate the fact that the Kerrigan\u2019s laundry is aired out in newspapers all around the world and everybody has to know all about us,\u201d her other brother, Michael, said at the time.  Nancy married her manager, Jerry Solomon, in 1995. They live in Lynnfield, Mass., and have three children.  Neighbors in the suburban Boston town remembered Daniel Kerrigan as a man who doted on his daughter and was completely devoted to all his children.  \u201cIt is a terrible, terrible thing,\u201d said neighbor Betty Svendsen. \u201cHe is the loveliest man. He sacrificed all of his life for his children.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom. I\u2019m in shock.\u201d  Stoneham resident Jim Sarno said, \u201cI\u2019ll always remember how he helped young skaters at the Stoneham rink. I can still visualize him on the Zamboni making ice.\u201d  Neighbors recalled a close-knit family, but court papers filed in 2008 revealed severe problems brewing under the surface.  According to records, Nancy\u2019s parents sued Mark in 2006, claiming he owed them $105,000 for taking care of his dogs, paying his mortgage and for hiring a lawyer to represent him on assault charges in 2006.  Mark\u2019s address at the time was listed as the Middlesex County House of Correction, where he was serving a sentence for the assault.  Mark was held on $10,000 bail yesterday after an arraignment during which he hung his head and wept.  Prosecutors said he had a long criminal record that included arrests for assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, malicious destruction and violation of a restraining order.  He was released in November and has been living in his parents\u2019 basement ever since.  Family and friends came to the house in the steady rain yesterday, delivering food and heartfelt prayers.  Some recalled how the media flocked to the neighborhood when Nancy\u2019s career peaked. Now the spotlight was back, and no one was happy.  \u201cWe were all so thrilled for Nancy then,\u201d Svendsen said. \u201cShe\u2019s devoted to her mother and will be her strength.\u201d  leonard.greene@nypost.com  ",

Some of the excitement as that familiar John Williams tune (\u201cJourney to the Island\u201d) plays over the end credits is in wondering just how the next sequel will play out after this latest film\u2019s game-changing finale. Then you realize that much of what you\u2019ve seen has been a feature-length prologue for the next sequel. Jurassic World 2 spends two hours to get the chess pieces into position before promising that you\u2019ll get the payoff in Jurassic World 3.  This kind of franchise filmmaking usually bugs the hell out of me. One of the things I appreciated about Jurassic World was that it was both a sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy and a self-contained action-adventure movie that offered few clues about where the sequel might go. Whether or not Colin Trevorrow and friends had the long game mapped out or not, that first $1.672 billion-grossing summer sequel worked as a newbie-friendly popcorn entertainment first and as a world-building franchise installment second. To their credit, neither the filmmakers nor the studio dropped any sequel hints before or after Jurassic World opened.  J.A. Bayona\u2019s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, again written by Trevorrow and Derek Connelly, tries to have it both ways. It is a stand-alone adventure for folks who haven\u2019t seen any of the Jurassic Park movies and for those who at least saw Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. But, as revealed in the third act, it is also feature-length set-up for the real game, a game that presumably begins in summer 2021. Jurassic World 3 is seemingly the movie that Trevorrow has been waiting to make from the beginning, and that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were partially about getting the pieces into place.  That it gets away with this \u201cdon\u2019t worry folks, you\u2019ll get the movie you came to see next time\u201d gambit is due to two particular factors.  First, it works as a singular movie featuring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt dealing with deadly dinos and duplicitous humans in a way that improves Jurassic World. If you thought that Clare and Owen were villains the last time, or that the dinosaurs should be left to die, this movie\u2019s got your back. Even once it\u2019s revealed as a feature-length prologue, it still offers plenty of in-the-moment thrills, chills and spills, along with some gorgeous widescreen cinematography that looks great in IMAX and Cinemark XD. It may be set up, but it\u2019s a solid, three-star blockbuster in its own right.  Second, most importantly, we\u2019re actually getting a sequel. The movie doesn\u2019t spend its entire running time to set up a sequel that will never actually happen, since we all know there will be a \u201cnext time, on Jurassic World.\u201d To be fair, this is a problem more common with origin story reboots or franchise-starters. Think Universal's Jem and the Holograms, WB's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and Fox's Fantastic Four, where the entire \u201cfirst\u201d film is a pure set-up before we see the iconic characters as we wanted to see them, all ready to kick butt in a sequel that will never actually happen.  Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom isn\u2019t so different from \u201cpart two\u201d sequels like Fox's Independence Day: Resurgence or Universal and Legendary's Pacific Rim: Uprising. They both end on a quasi-cliffhanger which promises a rather exciting and unique sequel that won\u2019t actually happen since they bombed. Instead of making the \"neat new idea\" movie, they spent an entire sequel doing a poorly-received rehash of the first film to set up that third flick. It\u2019s not quite the same, but imagine how much better Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc.'s Justice League would have performed if it was a \u201cJustice League versus the Legion of Doom\u201d movie teased by its post-credits sequence as opposed to a soft remake of The Avengers.  Fallen Kingdom still tells a story that is unique unto itself compared to its franchise predecessors. It starts off as an island adventure, shifts into an Indiana Jones-like second act and finally goes shockingly intimate and plays like a glorified haunted house movie in the finale. Oh, and since Jurassic World earned $1.672 billion three years ago, the filmmakers correctly had faith that enough moviegoers would show up to this one to justify at least a third installment. Unlike so many \u201cyou\u2019ll get what you want next time\u201d sequels and reboots, Treverrow, Bayona and friends wrote a check that they\u2019ll be able to cash.  I have no idea where the third film will go with this story and these characters, and that's pretty exciting. Unlike so many movies that promised a fantastic sequel fully aware that they might not get to make that movie, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a feature-length prologue to a film that will actually get made. It commits one of the gravest sins in franchise filmmaking but gets away with it just the same. That\u2019s at least partially because they gave us a crowd-pleasing and standalone Jurassic World before getting into the long-term world-building. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom changed the game, but not before Jurassic World made sure that moviegoers wanted to play.",

Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff is the most prolific female heroine in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has appeared in a number of its films.  First appearing in a small role in Iron Man 2, the character achieved great popularity following her major turns in Avengers Assemble and then Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  In recent years, Black Widow has continued to play a major role in the Avengers line-up, appearing in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and also in Avengers: Endgame, where the character tragically lost her life.  It had been long hoped for, however, that the MCU would produce a solo entry for the flexible Russian spy, and now it's almost here.  With the film now finally on its way (after multiple delays), The Mirror breaks down all we know about the Widow spinning her own web...  Black Widow UK release date  Black Widow will now be released in cinemas and on Disney+ Premier Access on July 9, 2021.    Image: Marvel Studios/Disney) Marvel Studios/Disney)  This enables both a theatrical and digital release, but the Premier Access release will require further fees to be paid.  It was originally planned for May 2020 and later delayed until November 2020 and then to May 2021 due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.  Black Widow trailer  We finally have the first action-packed teaser trailer for the film.  It looks set to be an action-packed battle for Black Widow - or should that be Widows?  Catch it at the top of this article.  Black Widow director  Australian director Cate Shortland helmed the film.  She is the first solo female director on a Marvel Cinematic Universe film.  Black Widow cast  Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff  ScarJo is back to play the founding female Avenger, who was killed off in Avengers Endgame.  Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova  Image: Marvel Studios) Marvel Studios)  The British rising star has been cast as the second female lead, described as Natasha's \"moral opposite\".  She will portray Yelena Belova, a fellow Black Widow trained in the Red Room like Natasha.  In the trailer the pair fight but then aid each other, having a sisterly bond.  David Harbour as Red Guardian/Alexei Shostakov  Image: Marvel Studios) Marvel Studios)  The Stranger Things star will play the role of Russian super-soldier, Alexei.  He will apparently go on a big journey throughout the film as the character has a complex relationship with Natasha.  He is seen in the trailer reuniting with Natasha, Yelena, and Melina.  Rachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff  Image: Marvel Studios) Marvel Studios)  The Oscar-winning star of The Favourite will play the role of a seasoned spy trained from the Red Room who is deeply involved in a scientific experiment.  Weisz has revealed that Melina is also a Black Widow.  O-T Fagbenle as Rick Mason  The Handmaid's Tale star will portray a figure from Natasha's past at SHIELD who she has a romantic history with.  As with most spies, we are still suspicious about this character.  Ray Winstone as Dreykov  The Sexy Beast star has been cast in the Black Widow film, according to Variety.  It has now been confirmed that he will portray the commander of the Red Room where the Black Widows are trained.  The character was referenced in Black Widow's first scene in the first Avengers film.  Taskmaster  Image: MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT) MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT)  The latest reports suggest that the main villain that Natasha will face is the classic Marvel Comics villain Taskmaster, which was later confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con.  So who will be the Taskmaster?  Unless a casting is revealed then we reckon that either Rick Mason or Melina will be the Taskmaster.  He is glimpsed in the trailer with a bow and arrow.  William Hurt as Secretary Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross  Image: MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT) MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT)  The architect of the Sokovia Accords is glimpsed in the trailer and is likely pursuing Natasha after the events of Captain America: Civil War.  Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man/Tony Stark  Iron Man himself is due to appear in the film for a cameo role.  Black Widow plot  Image: MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT) MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT)  The film takes place following the events of Captain America: Civil War and before Avengers: Infinity War and sees Natasha's past catch up with her as a deadly experiment threatens the world.  Marvel producer Kevin Feige has stated to Deadline that \u201cWe think she\u2019s an amazing character. We think Scarlett Johansson\u2019s portrayal of her is amazing. She\u2019s a lead Avenger and has amazing stories in her own right to tell that we think would be fun to turn into a standalone franchise\u201c.  What would you like from a Black Widow film?

Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe's maternity clothing (which she was giving to Rachel earlier in the episode) to ease the strain on his stomach. The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. Despite being extremely full, Joey still has room for pie.  Production [ edit ]  It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood,[2] though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen.[3] Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.[4] When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway.[3] The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.[5]  Reception [ edit ]  As the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: \"Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness \u2013 despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the audience did, too.\"[6] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was \"definitely ... going against type\"[7] and Matt LeBlanc called him \"really great on the show\".[4] USA Today rates Will's line \"Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates\" one of the best of the episode.[8]  The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode \"ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional\". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society's website and read an on-air apology before future episodes.[9] In a retrospective article about the episode, openly intersex writer Matt Mitchell further criticized the story for its anti-intersex overtones, stating that \"I can't think about Friends without thinking about the intersex joke that was written and greenlit by people who held my community up to the light and tormented us for somehow being, by their own standards, less human than everyone else.\"[10]  Primetime Emmy Award nominations [ edit ]  Pitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.[11]  References [ edit ]",

The club, which was solely driven by Will's hatred of Rachel, spread a rumor that Rachel was a hermaphrodite. The episode, directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan, aired on NBC on November 22, 2001, and continues the series' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition.

The episode features Joey Tribbiani struggling with an enormous turkey, and the reveal that Rachel and Will are having a baby together. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals. Despite receiving criticism, the episode was admired by the main stars, with Schwimmer calling Pitt \"definitely ... going against type\" and Matt LeBlanc calling him \"really great on the show.\" The episode's rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, and the episode was ranked one of the worst guest star appearances in Friends by Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times.",

What will allow the World trilogy to always have an upper hand over that of the will-always-be-superior original and its two less than successful follow-ups is that of the coherency this new set of films will seemingly possess and thus is what initially makes Fallen Kingdom so intriguing. Intriguing in a morbid curiosity kind of way as the first act of the film would have one believe it was something of a task to bring together our protagonists from the first film. Bryce Dallas Howard's no longer high-heel wearing Claire Dearing has become a voice for the dinosaurs left abandoned on Isla Nublar as a volcano is set to erupt at any moment threatening another extinction-level event. Convenient, right? Well, as it turns out this is not only an opportunity for writers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow to move the action off of the island (a good thing), but it also creates inspiration for Claire to reach out to now ex-boyfriend and \"raptor wrangler\" Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) so that they may reunite in an effort to rescue as many dinos from the island as they can. Is it necessary that Owen be brought back into the action? Not entirely and Fallen Kingdom does Pratt's character no favors by giving him little to do other than become a human super hero who in turn becomes more of a dinosaur whisperer than a trainer that is also doomed to repeat the romantic beats of the first film with Claire, but to not have the star of the first film return would feel weird as well. It makes sense to a degree, but this contradiction of sorts in need versus obligation is symbolic of what seems will come to define the shortcomings of this new trilogy as well. Owen is a fun and charismatic character that functioned well for the plot of the first film, but who is only called on to be fun and charming in this sequel despite the function of his character within the plot being largely pointless (though this wouldn't be as glaring if there were more depth to the character). The movies themselves are breezily enjoyable and often times massively entertaining, but the plots on which they function will seemingly only feel more and more strained the further they push this. In essence, other than for financial reasons is there a story worth telling that justifies the existence of more of these movies? The moral dilemma of should man do something simply because it is capable has been obliterated as yet another genetically engineered dino is at the heart of Fallen Kingdom with this film moving more into should these dinosaurs be regarded in the same way as other endangered species despite being created in a lab. Much in the same way Owen is charming and fun to have around even if his presence is mostly unnecessary Fallen Kingdom only brings up said points to try and validate its existence without ever exploring them enough to make this movie feel necessary. read the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com  Show Less  Show More",

The studio has been building up a shared cinematic universe in recent years featuring characters from the DC comics. Launched in Man of Steel, then truly kickstarted in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, the franchise has come to feature some of DC's most iconic heroes and villains. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Harley Quinn and more have been heavily featured in the films. Still, Warner Bros. has plenty more movies in development.  One such film revolves around Barbara Gordon aka. Batgirl, which was initially being developed by Joss Whedon. Then, Whedon stepped down from Batgirl earlier this year, and it was thought Barbara Gordon's solo movie would be delayed as a result. However, Warner Bros. is still moving forward with the Batgirl movie, hiring writer Christina Hodson, who wrote Paramount's upcoming Transformers spinoff Bumblebee and fellow DC movie Birds of Prey. Now, a new rumor offers insight into who Warner Bros. may be looking to cast as the titular superhero in Batgirl.  Related: Why Joss Whedon Left Batgirl Explained  DanielRPK, the Twitter user who has reported a number of DC-related rumors (though not all turned out to be true), tweeted over the weekend that Warner Bros. is looking to cast a \"Kristen Stewart prototype\" for Batgirl. His tweet further implies the studio may be looking to cast Stewart herself and, if that doesn't happen, they'll look for an actress in the same vein. It should be noted that this rumor comes from an unsubstantiated source and, as such, it should be taken with a major grain of salt. See the tweet below.  The tweet further confirms what was reported last week, that Batgirl won't be in Birds of Prey, which disappointed fans of the comics' female team-up. However, if Warner Bros. is beginning to talk about who they want to cast in the role of Barbara Gordon, that should indicate the studio is preparing to move forward with it. It's unclear where Hodson is at in the script-writing process, but if she's putting the finishing touches on Batgirl, finding a director and star are Warner Bros' next steps.  While this rumor indicates Warner Bros. is looking at Stewart or someone along those lines, it remains to be seen if that's truly who they'll cast. The Batgirl movie is still in the early stages of development. As previously stated, it's unclear if the studio even has a finished script yet, so plans may change. That said, at the very least, this rumor seems to reveal Warner Bros. is dedicated to bringing Batgirl to the big screen. With so many projects in various stages of development, it can be difficult to tell what the studio really plans to move forward with in the coming years. However, with four movies officially announced, and more getting closer to being ready to be officially confirmed, hopefully Warner Bros. will reveal more of their upcoming DC slate soon.

        "doc_1_text": "1 SHARES Facebook Twitter  A few months ago, we received a teaser trailer for the upcoming Christopher Robin film. It didn\u2019t show a lot of the premise of the film, but what it did show was Winnie the Pooh in live action setting. While there were people the criticised how Pooh looked, the overall thoughts were positive. Having a film that has Pooh search out an older Christopher Robin seems like the exact film we need. Then came the release of a new trailer today, and I can say it hit every emotion it needed.  Christopher Robin is a film that will show an older Christopher Robin, but showing a person who\u2019s forgotten about his past. Winnie the Pooh and friends seem to never forgetting about him, which makes the trailer seem so much more tragic. Anyone who watched cartoons or films of these characters can surely feel this. The film seems to follow a timeline that will allow Christopher Robin to help Pooh, but then make Pooh and friends help Christopher Robin. This is a great concept as it seems while Christopher Robin has forgotten about his furry friends, his friends never forgotten about him. It seems the only conclusion can be a sad one.  Why should fans be excited for this film? Disney is bringing us to a place where we have been in other films, but it\u2019s different since we never saw this with Winnie the Pooh. A film that could be used as a comparison is the 1991 film, Hook, starring Robin Williams as Peter Pan. In Hook, Peter forgets about Neverland and the Lost Boys, but the longer he stayed there, the more he remembered. Christopher Robin will probably be more of a drama than Hook, as Hook was an action film.  Overall, this is the perfect film for the family. The older generations that grew up with Winnie the Pooh, like myself, can enjoy this film with their families. The nostalgic factor is there, but the film doesn\u2019t seem it since this is a live action film. And with today\u2019s technology, Disney can really show us something we\u2019ve never seen before with these characters.  Christopher Robin will be released on August 3, 2018, starring Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, Tigger and Ewan McGregor (who should be starring in an Obi Wan film soon).

        "doc_2_text": "Lionsgate  Well, this is a nice surprise. Halle Berry just dropped word via Instagram that the actress will be joining the cast of the third John Wick flick. Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the (presumably) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti-hero, but A) it's cool that the (presumed) female lead will be about as old the male lead (she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27) and B) I'm a huge fan of Berry's recent pulp fiction endeavors (The Call and Kidnap), so this is pretty cool casting.  Lionsgate also just announced that Angelica Houston, Asia Kate Dillon (TVs Billions and Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Lucky Day, Hawaii 5-0, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and Jason Mantzoukas (The Long Dumb Road, The House) will join the cast of John Wick: Chapter 3. Yes, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick will return as well. I'm not sure if Ruby Rose survived her encounters with Mr. Wick in part two, but I kinda hope she comes back too. What this arguably means is that Lionsgate may end up emphasizing an ensemble cast this time out, as opposed to the first two films which were (understandably) the Keanu Reeves Show.  That's no shade on Mr. Wick or the actor who plays him, but as I noted in the last post about the Mission: Impossible franchise, there is perhaps a greater value, at least for overseas box office, in ensemble action flicks as opposed to solo/lone-wolf movies. Think Deadpool 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Fate of the Furious and Avengers: Infinity War. Even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was sold as a four-person adventure, highlighting Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.  So, if Lionsgate feels that they can get more overseas bucks the third-go around (John Wick: Chapter 2 made $92 million domestic and $79m overseas) by offering something resembling an ensemble cast, well, that's one option on the table. That doesn't mean that John Wick will go about recruit a super-assassin squad to deal with that pesky \"everyone wants to kill me now\" status quo from the end of the last John Wick, but I will be interested to see how these new cast members are integrated into the new movie. And yeah, bringing Halle Berry onboard is a nice touch.  Come what may, John Wick: Chapter 3 opens next year. Even as someone who thought that John Wick: Chapter 2 ended on a pretty definitive note (not unlike The Dark Knight or The Last Jedi), I'm still curious to see what the Wick crew has up their sleeve for a threequel.",

        "doc_1_text": "Update (Dec. 14): Disney has announced that it will acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox assets, including the rights to X-Men, Avatar, FX Networks, and The Simpsons.  Original story: Disney and 21st Century Fox are expected to close a deal this week giving Disney ownership over Fox\u2019s TV and film properties.  This means Disney will own the rights to certain Marvel franchises, such as The X-Men, Deadpool and The Fantastic Four. The film rights to Marvel Comics characters have been divided for quite some time; Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man, for example, which meant that up until very recently, Marvel Studios couldn\u2019t use Spider-Man in its movies. It was only when a deal was struck between Disney and Sony Pictures in 2015 that the former company could license the character for its Marvel Cinematic Universe films. This upcoming acquisition is a little different.  Unlike the Spider-Man situation, in which Sony still owns the rights to the character, Disney would fully own the rights to every Marvel superhero currently under Fox\u2019s banner. The company won\u2019t have to rely on licensing to feature Wolverine in an Avengers movie.  For some actors and directors, the move to create a unified cinematic universe in which every Marvel superhero can play in is a step in the right direction. For others, including Logan director James Mangold, there is some concern about what this could mean for their future.  \u201cIf they\u2019re actually changing their mandate, if what they\u2019re supposed to do alters, that would be sad to me because it just means less movies,\u201d Mangold told Deadline. \u201cThe real thing that happens when you make a movie rated R, behind the scenes, is that the studio has to adjust to the reality that there will be no Happy Meals. There will be no action figures.\u201d  20th Century Fox found a lucrative business model in R-rated movies. Both Deadpool and Logan benefited from the creative freedom to explore adult topics and use vulgar language, which many Marvel movies by definition can not. Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told investors in a recent call that Disney, including subsidiaries like Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios, would never make a hard R-movie.  A Bloomberg report says otherwise. Acquiring 21st Century Fox would give Iger the opportunity to release more mature movies under a different umbrella. There\u2019s no reason that Iger would get involved with character cross-pollination if he saw the deal as a means to an end for cashing in on the release of movies he can\u2019t produce at Disney. Bloomberg notes:  At Disney, Iger scaled back film releases, focusing on a handful of key brands. His strategy with the Fox assets could be very similar, using the 20th Century Fox label for some of the more edgy movies, for example.  That\u2019s not to suggest that Disney and Marvel Studios couldn\u2019t incorporate some of Fox\u2019s more popular characters for their own movies. This acquisition will give Disney a chance to explore what the Avengers and the X-Men or Spider-Man and Deadpool look like on screen together. Could the Fantastic Four team up with a new Avengers team in the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe?  No one\u2019s quite sure, but that hasn\u2019t stopped actors like Hugh Jackman, who played Wolverine for 17 years and came to define the character, from feeling the slightest bit of resentment over what the future cinematic superhero landscape looks like. Jackman told Collider:  It\u2019s interesting because for the whole 17 years I kept thinking that would be so great, like I would love to see, particularly, Iron Man and the Hulk and Wolverine together. And every time I saw an Avengers movie I could just see Wolverine in the middle of all of them like punching them all on the head. But it was like, \u201cOh well, that\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d and it was interesting just when I first saw that headline \u2014 it was just the possibility of it and who knows what\u2019s gonna happen, obviously \u2014 I was like, \u201cHang on!\u201d But I think, unfortunately, the ship has sailed for me, but for someone else I would like to see Wolverine in there.  It\u2019s an uncertain time and that means people are concerned about what happens next with some of the most beloved franchises in film right now. Fans are worried, directors are on edge and actors are reminiscing over could have been. There are a few actors, however, who are more than happy to see if the deal can reunite friends once and for all.  So who do I talk to about a Cap/Human Torch buddy comedy spin-off? I\u2019m thinking Planes, Trains and Automobiles meets Parent Trap. https://t.co/3KRPZOVzq2 \u2014 Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) December 6, 2017  If the deal goes through, it will be one of the biggest ever in the film industry. A Disney-Fox deal is estimated at more than $60 billion; Iger\u2019s last major acquisition \u2014 the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012 \u2014 pales in comparison.",

        "doc_2_text": "The immediate future of the James Bond franchise is in chaos after the sudden departure of the director Danny Boyle.    Three months before shooting on the as-yet-untitled film was scheduled to start, the Oscar-winning film-maker behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting quit, leaving producers scrambling.  A delay to the scheduled release date of 25 October 2019 looks inevitable; there is also speculation the fallout could stretch further, claiming star Daniel Craig as another victim.  A tweet from the franchise\u2019s official account announced on Monday evening: \u201cMichael G Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25.\u201d  Industry insiders suspect these differences revolve around the script, which Boyle wrote with his long-term collaborator John Hodge. The pair previously collaborated on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle\u2019s debut, Shallow Grave.  The Bond script was reportedly a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2012 before returning (having previously quit) for 2015\u2019s Spectre.  Daniel Craig in the most recent James Bond film, Spectre. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists  The producers were reportedly so keen to secure Boyle that they put an already completed screenplay, by the longtime 007 writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, on the back-burner. Purvis and Wade have previously written six Bond films, including all four Craig outings, as well as the final two starring his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan.  Hodge and Boyle\u2019s script \u2013 which is different in all respects \u2013 was thought to have been a work-in-progress until recently, and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a Bond film.  A leaked casting-call sheet indicated that the key villain would be Russian, and Boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era.  \u201cYou write in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world \u2013 but you also write in the modern world as well.\u201d  Boyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a great idea so hopefully it will work\u201d \u2013 which some speculated could involve a high-concept plot in which Bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time \u2013 or, potentially, die.  The high-stakes nature of such a twist, and the controversial real-life issues the film may have explored, may well have proved a sticking point with producers. Bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality, with Spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage. However, grappling with issues such as sexual assault and Russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble.  Although Mendes and Craig\u2019s tenure has put Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m (\u00a3232m), little compromise for the film\u2019s commercial prospects can be countenanced.  Boyle and Hodge\u2019s script is unlikely to survive the director\u2019s exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade\u2019s draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest.  Producers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Although there were four years between Craig\u2019s second outing, Quantum of Solace (2008) and his third, Skyfall (2012), the longest break between Bond films is only six years \u2013 between Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) \u2013 and that involved a change of actor in the leading role.  This makes it yet more likely that Craig, 50, will call it a day. Until there was confirmation he would return alongside Boyle, speculation had been rife that the actor, a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer, would move on, with Idris Elba and Tom Hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him.  Promoting Spectre in 2015, Craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role; months later, his departure seemed all but certain following that of Mendes.  In 2016, Craig was reportedly offered $150m to star in another two Bond movies by Broccoli, and this year he was confirmed for at least one more.  Craig and Boyle have worked together once before: when the former appeared as Bond, alongside the Queen, in a brief film that featured in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, which Boyle directed.  Mark Tildesley, Boyle\u2019s favoured production designer, was also recruited to the Bond film this year. His future on the project is now unknown.  Boyle\u2019s latest film, a romcom scripted by Richard Curtis, is scheduled for release in September 2019 \u2013 just a month before the Bond movie was due to come out. It is distributed by Universal Pictures, which recently took on UK distribution rights to the Bond films from Sony Pictures, which was responsible for getting Boyle\u2019s most recent big screen release, T2: Trainspotting, into cinemas.  Possible replacements for Boyle include Christopher Nolan, Christopher McQuarrie and Susanne Bier. McQuarrie\u2019s latest film, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, was widely praised for its Bond-style plot and stunts. The film, which stars Tom Cruise, has so far made $500m at the box office.",

However, Hodge and Boyle's script was thought to have been a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2012 before returning (having previously quit) for Spectre.\n\nWith Mendes and Craig's tenure putting Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m, little compromise for the film's commercial prospects can be countenanced.\n\nBoyle and Hodge's script is unlikely to survive the director's exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade's draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters, and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest.\n\nProducers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Craig, who recently celebrated his 50th birthday, had previously indicated that he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role.\n\nUpdate (Dec. 14): Disney has announced that it will acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox assets, including the rights to X-Men, Avatar, FX Networks, and The Simpsons. This means Disney will own the rights to certain Marvel franchises, such as The X-Men, Deadpool, and The Fantastic Four. The film rights to Marvel Comics characters have been divided for quite some time; Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man, for example, which meant that up until very recently, Marvel Studios couldn't use Spider-Man in its movies. It was only when a deal was struck between Disney and Sony Pictures in 2015 that the former company could license the character for its Marvel Cinematic Universe films.",

Hey @EW I\u2019m bored.

Yes! Meet us here at noon ET. We\u2019ve got something Marvel-ous in mind. \ud83d\ude09 \u2014 Entertainment Weekly (@EW) September 5, 2018  It's anyone's guess as to exactly what reveal will be breaking the internet, whether its a few official promo photos \u2014 similarly to how the magazine has covered upcoming releases Aquaman and Shazam! \u2014 or something else entirely. But with rumors swirling around that the film's first trailer could arrive sometime this month, fans will surely be excited to see the promotional campaign officially beginning.  Captain Marvel will see Larson's Carol Danvers making her highly-anticipated big screen debut, as she becomes a superhero in the 1990s amid the Kree-Skrull War. The film is co-directed by Mississippi Grind and It's Kind of a Funny Story's Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and will also star Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Jude Law, and Lashana Lynch.  \"We really were bringing so much of what was already in the comics onto the screen, it felt like, in terms of the amazing character who's so funny and sassy and talks back, and she's fearless,\" screenwriter Geneva Robertson-Dworet said in a previous interview. \"I love that Carol Danvers is so funny. She has a blast when she kicks ass. Those comics are amazing! It's an amazing world and sandbox to play in. You're working with incredible creative people, every day. I had a total dream experience.\"  \"I think the way the film opens is much different than an origin movie, and because she is a heroine that you haven't seen before, we're able to tell this story structurally in a way that will feel unexpected and hopefully will keep audiences off balance,\" producer Nate Moore said of the 1990s-set adventure. \"Still balanced enough that they can enjoy the film, but even just making it a period film is sort of interesting in that it's not just a function of the world as we know it in the MCU today.\"  Are you excited by Larson's Captain Marvel tease? What do you think the surprise could be? Let us know what you think in the comments below.  Avengers: Infinity War is now available on digital platforms, DVD, and Blu-ray. Ant-Man and the Wasp is in theaters now.

The new issue of Entertainment Weekly offers our first look at Nicole Kidman's character in the film, Queen Atlanna, alongside Momoa and Amber Heard as Mera. Check out the cover below.  (Photo: Entertainment Weekly)  Atlanna debuted in 1959's Adventure Comics #260, which focused on the early years of Arthur Curry. The comic depicted Atlanna getting washed ashore by a hurricane, ultimately falling in love with lighthouse keeper Tom Curry, resulting in Arthur's birth.  It's unclear exactly how closely to her comics origins the film will stick, though Kidman has professed her enthusiasm over the experience.  \"I got to be [like] a mermaid!\" Kidman revealed to The Hollywood Reporter last year. \"I got to be a queen, I got to wear a crown...I have a particular way of looking.\"  The upcoming film was directed by James Wan, who mastered the horror world with films like The Conjuring and Insidious before making the leap to big-budget actions films with Furious 7. Kidman teased that Aquaman will appeal to fans of a variety of demographics.  \"I got to lie on a rock with my hair strewn, and blood,\" Kidman pointed out. \"And I kind of liked it.\"  Wan also teased that the world he's exploring in the film marks uncharted territory for the filmmaker.  \"The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it's like I'm making my own sci-fi fantasy film,\" Wan shared with Entertainment Weekly. \"This is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.\"  Fans of Aquaman enjoyed his appearance in Justice League, though the ways in which his underwater encounters were handled left much to be desired. According to former president of DC Entertainment Geoff Johns, the new film will appease devout fans.  \"The underwater stuff has never been executed like this before,\" Johns confessed. \"The visual effects shots coming in are just beautiful. James can switch modes from horror to big bright colorful action to really emotional scenes. He's so able to hit all these different genres.\"  Footage from the film was recently screened at CineEurope, likely confirming audiences' first look at an Aquaman trailer debuting in the near future.

Since premiering during the Warner Bros Hall H panel, the Aquaman trailer has more than 19M views from the WB upload alone, far outpacing any other trailer revealed during Comic-Con 2018.  In his second appearance in the DCEU, Jason Momoa's Aquaman finally takes on a leading role in his own film, which Warner Bros. hopes will rekindle fan excitement after the disappointing critical reception and box office performance of last year's Justice League.  \"I wanted our film to be more unique.

The Mission: Impossible 6 star also revealed that the movie's title confirming that Top Gun 2 will adopt the lead character's name in the title. The sequel will be called, Top Gun: Maverick.  Following the announcement, no other official announcements regarding the movie's cast or plot were shared thereafter as the actor got involved in wrapping up MI6. With no more official word available, a report by Star claims that Cruise has approached John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston to co-star in the movie. Fans would remember that Preston was Cruise's co-star in Jerry Maguire.  Trending: Mission: Impossible 6 trailer  Bizarrely, the news report associates his request to the actress who is associated with Scientology. A source allegedly claims, \"Tom thinks she's super talented, not to mention sexy\" and wants her in the movie. But Travolta is apparently opposing Cruise's offer because the former resents the fellow Scientologist.  \"John's always been jealous of the church giving Tom top billing. Tom already gets whatever he wants, but John draws the line at his wife,\" the insider said.  Meanwhile, Gossip Cop claims otherwise. The site reports that there is no tension between the two actors. The website also clarifies that Cruise hasn't even approached Preston about a role in the July 2019 release.  While fans wait to watch things unfold, Justin Marks teased the plot of the sequel. The screenwriter, who has penned down the early draft of Maverick, recently told Slash, hinting towards a love angle in the movie.  \"Without getting into details, that was something that was important to everyone to avoid, to find something new,\" Marks said. \"I think [Producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer] would kill me if I told any specific details.\"  He added, \"Here's what I can say about what I brought to it. I know I want it to be a story about Maverick where we get to see Maverick being Maverick in the way we want him to be. I feel like times have changed in 30 years but the desire for that kind of hero still remains the same. That doesn't mean he's a perfect character. That's the fun of it.\"",

        "doc_2_text": "Changing the writer and director for this third Iron Man movie turns out to be the best thing that could have happened, because Shane Black is a much more focussed filmmaker, and he gives this franchise a badly needed kick. We know that he and Downey work well together (see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), but we could never have anticipated how Black would bring clarity to Downey's comical riffs. He also makes the action scenes much more human, and therefore a lot more thrilling.  The story takes place in the overall Marvel chronology. Wealthy arms manufacturer Tony Stark (Downey) is feeling badly shaken by his experience working with the Avengers to fight off an alien invasion. So he dives into his work and neglects his relationship with Pepper (Paltrow), who also runs his company. Then two faces from the past reappear: bio-scientist Maya (Hall) is an old colleague of Tony's, while technical genius Aldrich (Pearce) has a past with Pepper. And both seem somehow connected to a wave of nasty bombings that is terrorising America, masterminded by a menacing man who calls himself the Mandarin (Kingsley). And the Mandarin's next target is Tony.  Intriguingly, the script keeps Tony out of the Iron Man suit for much of the film's running time, which makes his character feel much more grounded than ever before. It also makes the action set pieces even more spectacular, since they're not mere robot-vs-robot animated battles. So even if the dialog is peppered with technical gibberish, at least it has a personal dimension. Which not only deepens Tony and Pepper as characters, but makes the surrounding people more interesting. These include Tony's old pal (Cheadle), two self-healing goons (Dale and Szostak) and a pre-teen (Simpkins) who helps Tony. And with his constantly surprising character, Kingsley very nearly steals the show.  Continue reading: Iron Man 3 Review",
        "generated_text": "Iron Man 3 Review\n\nIron Man 3, the third installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is a breath of fresh air for the franchise. With Shane Black taking over as both writer and director, the movie brings a much-needed kick to the series. Black and Robert Downey Jr., who have previously collaborated on the movie Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, work seamlessly together, providing a comedic edge to Downey's character that was previously lacking.\n\nThe story follows Tony Stark, played by Downey, as he struggles to balance his relationship with Pepper Potts (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and his work as a wealthy arms manufacturer. After working with the Avengers to fight off an alien invasion, Stark neglects his duties and finds himself in the crosshairs of a wave of bombings terrorizing America. The mastermind behind these bombings is the menacing Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the movie is the decision to keep Tony out of the Iron Man suit for much of the running time. This decision makes his character feel much more grounded, and the action set pieces are even more spectacular because they are not just robot-vs-robot battles. The movie also features a diverse cast of characters, including Tony's old friend Happy Hogan (played by Don Cheadle), two self-healing goons (played by Dale and Szostak), and a pre-teen (played by Ty Simpkins) who helps Tony.\n\nOverall, Iron Man 3 is a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It provides a much-needed breath of fresh air and keeps the franchise feeling relevant and exciting. With its diverse cast of characters and action-packed scenes, this movie is sure to please fans of the franchise and moviegoers alike.",

        "doc_1_text": "When Sony agreed to make a deal allowing the rights to Spider-Man extend to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, owned by rival Disney, they only signed over the Spider-Man character, not the Spiderverse. So though Spider-Man: Far From Home will be a co-production with the MCU, Sony still can make standalone superhero films of its own. The first, Venom, is heading into theaters this coming October, with Tom Hardy starring as the anti-hero lead. How does a superhero movie work with the villain as the protagonist? The new Venom trailer takes a deep dive into the monster hiding inside.  For those who have been trying to keep track of which Spider-Man character is which, Sony has introduced Venom before, about two rebooted Spideys ago, in the Toby McGuire-era Spider-Man 3. There, he was played by Topher Grace, who looked enough like McGuire to be his evil nemesis semi-doppelganger.  Since then Sony rebooted Spider-Man twice, once by itself with Andrew Garfield, and now a second time with the MCU and Tom Holland. It makes a sort of twisted sense it can reboot villains too, and even make them the hero of their own story.  Check out the trailer and the symbiote who takes over star Tom Hardy's character, reporter Eddie Brock and turns him (them?) into Venom.  It's a clever angle in a movie landscape where the MCU releases no less than three superhero movies a year, and 20th Century FOX has their own schedule of X-Men and X-Men spin-off films. (At least, they do until the Disney-FOX merger is completed in 2019, and probably for another year or two after as the two companies sort things out.) That's not to say the market is saturated yet, but the tagline \"The World Has Enough Superheroes\" is both a smart one for the film, with the benefit of also being correct in 2018.  There's a good way to take a villain and turn him into the protagonist: set him up against someone even worse. Brock doesn't mean to be terrible, he just has a parasite he's currently self-medicating. Compare to Riz Ahmed's character, who's company Brock is investigating when the film begins. He embraces everything evil about the symbiote he's joined with and happily joins others with the alien parasite without so much as a by-your-leave. Ahmed's evil antagonist is still unnamed, but fans are guessing will turn out to be Carlton Drake, the evil head of the Life Foundation.  This new trailer also gives us a look at Brock's love interest, Ann Weying, played by Michelle Williams. The movie also stars Jenny Slate and Woody Harrelson, as well as Reid Scott, Scott Haze, and Kelly Marcel.  As for whether Tom Holland will be eventually showing up in a Venom sequel, that's still up in the air. The MCU doesn't currently think the co-production characters should mix with Sony's stand-alone films. (Considering how confusing having three different studios making three different Marvelverse series is already, this is understandable.) But no one should ever say never. If Venom turns out to be a massive hit, Holland's Spider-Man might just find himself dropping in.  Venom arrives in theaters on October 5, 2018.",

John Ratzenberger's underground-obsessed antagonist didn't look like he'd be easy to defeat, but as far as the wider Incredibles 2 story goes, he's not serving as the lead villain. Disney and Pixar have been staying silent about just who the main threat in this movie is, but we finally have our first look at this mysterious baddie thanks to the latest Incredibles 2 poster.  See more  While Jack-Jack's adversary in Incredibles 2 is presumably that raccoon, judging by how the baby's trying to incinerate the pest with his heat vision, it's the individual above the movie's logo who will be causing trouble for the folks with special abilities. Granted, the poster doesn't technically label them as the villain, but with a look like that, it's hard to imagine they're going around doing good deeds. Are the glowing goggles just for show or do they allow the villain to hypnotize people? Does the villain have any natural superpowers or do they rely solely on technology/other resources? There's still a lot that needs to be revealed, but at least now we have an idea of what Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and the rest of the protagonists will be up against in Incredibles 2.  Looking at the background of this new Incredibles 2 poster, you can also make out some of the new superheroes who are being introduced in the sequel. The Incredibles went over how following the public being fed up with collateral damage, superheroes were forced to go into retire from their crimefighting activities and stay hidden in plain sight through their secret identities. However, Incredibles 2 will see a campaign to officially bring back the \"supers\" being launched, with Helen Parr, a.k.a. Elastigirl, spearheading the charge on behalf of businessman Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk). One of the new heroes we'll meet in Incredibles 2 is Voyd (Sophia Bush), a longtime Elastigirl fan who can make objects appear and disappear, but the other heroes haven't been officially identified yet. I can't help but worry that one of these \"heroes\" might actually be serving the villain. Just because it's a Pixar movie doesn't mean there can't be deception and betrayal.

The \u201cBarbie\u201d movie is said to be in the vein of \u201cSplash\u201d, \u201cEnchanted\u201d and \u201cBig.\u201d In it, the main character gets kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough and lands in a real-world adventure.  Schumer recently did a polish of the script. It\u2019s unknown whether the same tone will be kept with the comedian no longer attached.  Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Amy Pascal are producing the film. Parkes and MacDonald initiated the original deal with Mattel in 2014.  Schumer can be seen next in the action-comedy \u201cSnatched,\u201d which opens on May 12, 2017, and also has \u201cThank You for Your Service\u201d opening in October. She is repped by UTA, Carrie Byalick at B Company and Maverick Management.",

Following a box-office run where it made just over its budget with a $33 million gross, Death Wish 2018 is coming home digitally on 4K Ultra HD May 22nd, and then Blu-ray/DVD/VOD June 5th. It's all in good time to pay tribute to your dad by letting him imagine he'd be an action hero on your behalf, if circumstances ever arose.  The Blu-ray will include a commentary track by director Eli Roth and producer Roger Birnbaum, a grindhouse-style trailer, a featurette focusing on Roth's direction, extended scenes featuring deejays Mancow and Sway, and deleted scenes with optional Roth/Birnbaum commentary. I'm pleased to premiere one of those scenes right here. It takes place shortly after Paul Kersey (Willis) has had an uncomfortable run-in at a school sporting event for his daughter:  You can see why it didn't quite make the final cut--it feels like it's over-telling you Paul is a pacifist rather than showing you, and frankly nobody is going into this movie with any doubts about how things end up. As an audience member, you're waiting for him to get pushed over the line and do what Bruce Willis does, and it's a waste of time to take too long establishing the line itself.  It'll be interesting to see what else got deleted, though--perhaps there was an earlier cut with more ambiguity, one that played against Roth's natural instincts for grindhouse exploitation fare. Really, though, if you want something less gung-ho, watch the Charles Bronson version. The remake is unapologetic righteous fury, and will be best enjoyed if you know that going in.",

        "doc_1_text": "Another Comic-Con has come and gone. As always, it was full of delightful experiences and some so-so ones. So who came out of the show looking best? Let\u2019s look back on how this year\u2019s show went.  Winner \u2014 DC Wonder Woman did a lot to help the image of the DC movieverse, but all the drama of the past couple years doesn\u2019t go away easily. For the moment, at least, they made us forget with a Comic-Con trailer that looked much better than all the previous marketing and a glowing Ben Affleck on stage shooting down the rumors that he\u2019s on the way out as Batman. DC was a ton of fun.  Loser \u2014 DC With the DC Extended Universe really ramping up now, it kinda sucks that DC doesn\u2019t get its own Hall H presentation separate from the rest of the Warner Bros slate. Marvel has a big leg up in that regard.  Loser \u2014 \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d Another casualty of jamming the DC slate in with the rest of WB\u2019s lineup. For a nerd-aimed blockbuster to make a real splash in Hall H, it\u2019s gotta bring the goods, but Warner Bros didn\u2019t really do that with Blade Runner. They\u2019d already released a new trailer the Monday before Comic-Con, and there wasn\u2019t much to the brief clip that they showed. The return of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d is a huge deal, and it deserved better than a panel everybody had forgotten about an hour after it happened.  Winner \u2014 David Lynch The \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d co-creator didn\u2019t show up for the Showtime revival\u2019s panel in Hall H, but he certainly left an impression with a bizarre but incredibly funny video message to fans.  Winner \u2014 \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d There\u2019s an art to talking at length about your show without providing any details whatsoever but also not being boring \u2014 and the cast of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d pulled it off. Showtime also did fans a real solid with an early screening of Part 11 on Friday night. It\u2019d be tough for a TV show to show up to Comic-Con any better than that.  Loser \u2014 20th Century Fox Deadpool and X-Men were nowhere to be found in Hall H this year, much to the chagrin of the folks who has stayed up all night in line to see Fox\u2019s presentation.  Winner \u2014 \u201cKingsman: The Golden Circle\u201d The absence of \u201cDeadpool\u201d was good for \u201cKingsman,\u201d though, which got the entirety of Fox\u2019s Hall H hour to serve up fun antics (like Halle Berry chugging a pint of bourbon) and some lengthy and really impressive clips.  Loser \u2014 \u201cStar Wars\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d doesn\u2019t come to Comic-Con aside from merch booths on the show floor, but in 2016 you couldn\u2019t look in any direction without seeing somebody wearing \u201cStar Wars\u201d gear. This year, the amount of fans repping \u201cStar Wars\u201d was way, way down, indicating perhaps that enthusiasm for the mega-franchise has come back down to earth.  Loser \u2014 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d They came out and showed a very long trailer full of context-free shots, then a retrospective video, then went immediately to audience Q&A for the rest of the hour they had in Hall H. That\u2019s not exactly substantial content.  Winner \u2014 Marvel Film Comic-Con is kinda hellish in a lot of ways, but Marvel\u2019s Saturday-night showcase never fails to make it all seem worth it. This year was definitely not an exception, with fans in Hall H being treated to spectacular and really substantial clips from \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d as well as the \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d sizzle reel they showed at D23 the week before. If I were to call any presentation the overall winner of SDCC 2017 it would be this one. But that\u2019s usually the case.  Winner \u2014 \u201cThe Defenders\u201d Netflix really treated the fans in Hall H on Friday night, premiering the entire first episode of \u201cThe Defenders.\u201d And it was good! After a long day of mostly uneventful Hall H panels, it was a very welcome surprise.  Winner \u2014 Netflix Aside from \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Netflix showed off four minutes of its upcoming \u201cPunisher\u201d series and treated the Hall H crowd to some meaty clips from the films \u201cBright\u201d and \u201cDeath Note.\u201d Oh, and they also held a screening of \u201cDeath Note\u201d on Thursday night. Netflix really brought its A-game to Comic-Con this year.  Loser \u2014 \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Normally, Comic-Con takes place a months after the season has ended, meaning there isn\u2019t usually anything meaty for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to bring. We\u2019d hoped that this year would be different, since the panel took place a week into season 7. But aside from a new short trailer, this year\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d panel was as insubstantial as always. But, hey, at least Alfie Allen brought a puppy who is a good boy and won everything yes he did yes he did!",

        "doc_1_text": "advertising  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. \"If David Gordon Green called me up and said let\u2019s do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,\" Curtis said.  advertising  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  advertising  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

Disney\u2019s streaming service is expected to launch late next year.  Why is Marvel doing this? Well, when Netflix streams an MCU movie, Disney, which owns Marvel, only gets a cut of the money, since the company licensed the film rights to a third party. But by taking all its toys back and putting them on its own streaming service exclusively, Disney gets all of the subscription money that fans will pay because it\u2019ll be the only way to stream Avengers 4 or literally any other Disney movie. All the animated classics and new Star Wars movies will also live on Disney\u2019s streaming service, to say nothing of all the new franchises the House of Mouse now owns after having bought Fox.

Ben Affleck has become strangely evasive over his future as the DCEU's Batman after unconfirmed reports started circulating that he'd be stepping down from the role in the near future.  There's been something of a snowballing effect with rumours over the past few months, growing out of the shadows of Batman vs Superman's critical lashing, and reaching a new peak when Affleck stepped down as director of The Batman solo film.  War for the Planet of the Apes' Matt Reeves has since stepped in, essentially throwing Affleck's script out of the window and starting again. But what of Affleck himself?  \"Batman is the coolest f*cking part in any universe. DC, Marvel...\" he told fans in Hall H. \"I'm so thrilled to do it. I know there's this misconception that because I'm not directing it, maybe I wasn't enthusiastic about it. It's f*cking amazing... I would be a f*cking ape on the ground for Matt Reeves.\"  Ready Player One - Trailer  However, off stage, his stance seemed less sure. \"My status remains what it always is,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \"I\u2019ve done the two movies.

Certainly, if the Batphone rings, I will answer.\"  A more evasive approach which doesn't seem to even confirm his appearance in The Batman, and certainly doesn't hint that Affleck has any intention on further instalments down the line.

        "doc_1_text": "The Incredibles is one of Pixar's most acclaimed entries out of its impressive animation roster, praised for its many complex themes: familial tumult, what it means to be a superhero, and the perils of hiding one's true identity.  The family returns to the big screen 14 years later, picking up exactly where the last film left off \u2014 The Underminer is about to wreak havoc in the city, and Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, Violet, and Jack Jack are all there to save the day.  Except Incredibles 2 faces a unique challenge in this new era of superhero saturation. When the first film premiered in 2004, superhero movies weren't big spectacles \u2014 or at least not as significant as they are today, with Marvel's films alone raking in billions of dollars in the box office. Now, audiences are starved for big-budget, larger-than-life superhero movies, but they're also parched for good stories; those cleverly upend the superhero formula but also take advantage of it in ways that feel novel surprising.  Is 'Incredibles 2' Worth The Wait?  Make no mistake: this is a superhero film. The usual suspects are present: a world is in peril, a villain is causing trouble, many things are at stake, and the Parr family must save the world. But this is also a film with Pixar's stamp of quality, which means the tropes are never just mere embellishments, but part of a larger ploy to tell a story with enormous heart and ingenuity. As such, even with the film industry inundated with superhero stories that have been told many times over, Incredibles 2 feels fresh, smart, and keen. But is it a worthy sequel?  Here's what the critics are saying.  Incredibles 2 Review Roundup  Cinemablend: \"Rather than being a disappointment, it is instead a shining example of how to do a follow-up properly \u2014 wonderfully advancing the fantastic established characters and world, playing with smart, modern themes, and featuring beautiful, engaging and fascinatingly-consistent animation.\"  Vox: \"Incredibles 2 lacks some of the tight plotting, well-choreographed action, and emotional moments of its predecessor, but it's still a boatload of fun.\"  Screen Rant: \"It's a mostly fun and enjoyable summer family movie \u2014 though, with a nearly two-hour runtime, some children may struggle to stay engaged. Still, considering the strong and forward-thinking films Pixar has produced in recent years, Incredibles 2 is a sequel that arrived a decade too late.\"  Chicago Tribune: \"Others will disagree, but to me, Incredibles 2 falls short of the level of Toy Story 2 or Finding Dory. Those Pixar sequels wholly justified their existence in many satisfying ways, while doing their corporate duty and making hundreds of millions.\"  Consequence of Sound: \"It's as bright and visually inventive as its predecessor, and finds cheeky new outlets for [Bard] Bird's unbridled cinematic sensibilities.\"  RogerEbert.com: \"Incredibles 2 understands something that most family sequels, even the Pixar ones, fail to comprehend \u2014 we don't just want to repeat something we loved before. We want to love it all over again. You will with Incredibles 2.\"  Vulture: \"Brad Bird's Incredibles 2 is, much like its predecessor, delightful as an animated feature but really, really delightful as a superhero picture. It's proof that someone (not anyone, mainly Bird) can make a Marvel-type movie that's fleet and shapely, with action sequences rich in style rather than tumult.\"  Slate: \"Incredibles 2 is a movie that lavishes attention on the details but loses sight of the whole, where you can't see the forest for the meticulously rendered trees.\"  The Village Voice: \"Pixar's not-so-secret secret has always been that they understand parenting better than anyone else who makes movies for children. And Incredibles 2 is at its best \u2014 which is to say, it's funniest and most exciting \u2014 when it tackles the internal dynamics of the family itself.\"  Variety: \"The new movie, energized as it is, too often feels like warmed-over sloppy seconds, with a what-do-we-do-now? Riff that turns into an overly on-the-nose plot.\"  Incredibles 2 opens June 15.  \u24d2 2023 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.",

When Universal decided to make American Reunion, the fourth theatrical film in its lucrative American Pie franchise, it was determined to meet two goals: Produce the movie for less than the $55 million that 2003\u2019s American Wedding cost, and reunite the entire cast of the original 1999 comedy for a story that would see the characters congregate for their 10-year high school reunion.  VIDEO: \u2018American Reunion\u2019 Photo Montage Brings Back Old Memories  How the studio met those challenges is a study in prolonging a franchise on a sensible budget. Production on the $50 million film, which wrapped this summer in advance of an April 6 release, was moved to Georgia to take advantage of a generous tax credit.  Then the studio played hardball with the actors, who have experienced mixed levels of success outside of the franchise.

        "doc_1_text": "By the time Avengers: Endgame comes out, there will be 22 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you\u2019ve skipped one or two, there may be some lingering questions after watching Endgame\u2019s first trailer.  Avengers: Endgame\u2019s trailer sets up a surprising reveal: the surviving Avengers presumed that Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man, was killed when Thanos wiped out half of the universe\u2019s life, only to have him turn up on their doorstep at the end of the trailer. Lang\u2019s appearance \u2014 wildly waving his arms around and asking Captain America to let him into the makeshift Avengers headquarters \u2014 is to the great surprise of just about everyone.  Ant-Man didn\u2019t appear in Avengers: Infinity War, which could explain why heroes like Captain America, Black Widow, and Bruce Banner (the Hulk is also MIA) are shocked to learn that Lang survived. But Lang\u2019s appearance won\u2019t be surprising to anyone who watched Ant-Man and the Wasp, which arrived after Avengers: Infinity War.  \u201cWe\u2019re in the endgame now.\u201d  A post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp explains that while other people on Earth were shattering into dust following Thanos\u2019 snap, Ant-Man was in the quantum realm. Ant-Man may not have been killed by Thanos\u2019 snap \u2014 officially referred to as the Decimation, according to Marvel Comics \u2014 possibly because he wasn\u2019t within the universe at the time.  Now, and there\u2019s still a sense of disbelief over these next few words, but Ant-Man could be key to saving the world. Doctor Strange noted in Infinity War there was only one way this could play out, and Ant-Man\u2019s time spent in the quantum realm certainly seems like a part of that. Doctor Strange did see into the future \u2014 and he did give Thanos the Infinity Stone for a reason, saying that they were \u201cin the endgame now.\u201d Endgame will also likely rope in Captain Marvel and her space-traveling powers, so while everything may not rest on Ant-Man, he certainly has a bigger role than many of us may have originally thought.  There are only a few ways that Ant-Man could have escaped from the quantum realm after Hank, Janet, and Hope, who are reunited in the film, are decimated. Someone with knowledge of quantum realms, like Ava Starr / Ghost or Tony Stark (although he seems to be a bit busy being stranded in space) could potentially help with that. The Infinity Stones could reverse elements of time and space to bring Lang back, but it seems unlikely Thanos would do that.  This leaves another possibility: time vortexes. While Lang is exploring the quantum realm, he\u2019s warned to look out for time vortexes, whose name implies that if he passes through, could reconfigure time itself. This means when Lang teams up with the Avengers \u2014 or the remaining Avengers \u2014 they could use those time vortexes to reverse time and save the population from devastation.  Now, the issue with Avengers trailers \u2014 or any movie trailer \u2014 is you can\u2019t trust them. Remember that the Hulk starred in Avengers: Infinity War\u2019s trailers and then never appeared in the actual film. This could just be a cool gesture to throw fans from guessing what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 like we are \u2014 but this does help to explain how the Avengers could possibly defeat Thanos going forward.  It seems that to properly understand Avengers: Endgame, people are going to have to settle in and revisit Ant-Man and the Wasp. Who could have predicted that?",

Larson was photographed recently while filming the upcoming movie in Atlanta and she was outfitted in black and green. For those who are out of the loop, there is a reason why Captain Marvel is in this costume.  While it looks weird for some, it is actually not a deviation from the comics. Savvy comic book readers will recognize that the color scheme matches the old costume by the original Captain Marvel, aka Mar-Vell, before he switched it out for a red and blue one. According to reports, Carol Danvers herself donned a similar suit before she upgraded it to the most recognizable gear.  Don\u2019t forget the first Kree uniform! Then she upgraded it to the iconic red/yellow/blue!!!! MY HEART ITS HAPPENING #CaptainMarvel pic.twitter.com/zJLq78wnd6 \u2014 Captain Marvel News  It remains to be seen how Danvers gets the suit in the film. But, in theory, it could be her initial costume when she first receives her alien superpowers. \"Captain Marvel\" will take place partially in the 1990s, before the age of heroes and before Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) lost his left eye. Danvers' modern look will show up at a later point in the movie.  Co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck in a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Nicole Perlman, \"Captain Marvel\" will be the first superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to feature a female lead. Apart from Larson and Jackson, the buzzy blockbuster also stars Jude Law as Mar-Vell, and Ben Mendelsohn and DeWanda Wise in top-secret roles. The film is scheduled for release on March 8, 2019.  Whether or not Larson will debut as the character in this May 4's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is unclear, but she is definitely joining the squad in the upcoming \"Avengers 4.\" The MCU Phase 3 capper will hit theaters on May 3, 2019.",

John even turned down the role before the director won him over and Debra explained to EurWeb why she eventually signed on, saying:  \u201cI really believe in instinct and I believe in trying to silence the voice that says, \u2018what will other people think about this choice\u2019 and does this excite me, will this challenge me, does it scare me? You answer yes to those, you have to do it.\u201d  Searching is in theaters today.",

Oh well, I'm gonna say it: I am very shocked Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have lasted this long. The so-gorgeous-it-actually-defies-science couple have been serious for a while now, with both of them having met each other's families and gone on lots of vacations together. Next step: spending Christmas with each other's fams. The photos of Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik on Christmas Eve will, if you're a skeptic like me, make you believe their relationship is very much the real deal.  The couple of two years have actually spent Christmas Eve together in the past, so now it's pretty much a tradition. They spent this year making gingerbread houses and hanging out with family. Malik's sister, Safaa, was there, and they all posed for an adorable selfie on her Instagram story. The whole chill night was documented on her story, actually, and I'm sure it's that #goodcontent Gigi and Zayn stans ate right up. The photos consisted of lots of selfies in Christmas PJs (bless), the aforementioned gingerbread houses, and lots of holiday filters.  This selfie of Gigi, Zayn, and Safaa is adorable AF and shows just how much Gigi is part of the Malik fam.  Instagram/Gigi Hadid  She also posted this ~angelic~ selfie of her and her boo.  Instagram/Gigi Hadid  Uh, Gigi, the wings are blocking your face!  *Beyonc\u00e9 voice* We built gingerbread housesssssss.  Instagram/Gigi Hadid  Mama Hadid also built one!  Instagram/Gigi Hadid  Safaa Malik also posted this ~festive~ selfie on her Instagram story on Christmas Eve.  Instagram/Safaa Malik  And the other selfie on Christmas!  Gigi and Bella Hadid's brother, Anwar, was also in attendance at this blessed gathering, but he couldn't hang and fell asleep.  Instagram/Gigi Hadid  If you don't know who Anwar Hadid is, he's also a model. So that tracks. Unfortunately, there was no sign of Bella Hadid, but that doesn't mean she wasn't there! She might've just been off watching a basketball game on TV in another part of the house. We all know how much Bella Hadid loves basketball. And sneakers.  Anyway, back to Gigi and Zayn! The couple celebrated their two-year anniversary in November. Unsurprisingly, Hadid posted on her Instagram story to commemorate the occasion.  She posted a selfie of her and Malik kissing, saying, \"2 yrs w my favorite human.\"  Instagram/Gigi Hadid  While Malik rarely posts/talks about his relationship with Hadid in interviews, he did open up about their relationship being \"normal\" to them in a June interview with Evening Standard. He told the outlet, \"I can understand how it can look, that you\u2019ve got these two people in a \u2018power couple.\u2019 That\u2019s not something I want to be a part of. I\u2019m with her because I like her and I hope she\u2019s with me because she likes me.\" He added, \"When we come home, we don\u2019t really talk about that s\u2014. We just spend time together as a normal couple, cook food, watch TV, have a laugh.\"  In case you need more proof that these two are great together, Malik says Hadid helps him keep track of his busy life. Malik told Billboard, \"It\u2019s actually not that hard for us [to line up schedules]. It helps that she\u2019s really organized. Thank God! Because I\u2019m really not, so she helps organize my schedule around seeing her!\" He revealed she spends a lot of time with him when he's recording music. He said, \"She\u2019s in the studio quite a lot. She likes to cook for me and stuff \u2014 when I\u2019m here late, she\u2019ll come down and bring me food. She\u2019s cool.\" Yeah, she's cool. I totally know 'cause we're totally friends. I'm actually the one taking all of the photos on Hadid's Insta story, so.",

Last night a source close to couple revealed: \u201cSadly Zayn and Gigi have separated.  \u201cThey are no longer a couple but they do remain close and are supportive of each other.  \u201cThe reality is that they\u2019ve grown apart, having been together for a long time.  12 The pair have been together for more than two years Credit: Splash News  12 Zayn and Gigi at their first red carpet appearance at the Met Gala in 2016 Credit: Splash News  12 The couple were rumoured to be engaged Credit: \ufffd www.splashnews.com  \u201cThey have crazy work schedules that would put pressure on any relationship.\u201d  This afternoon Zayn hinted at the split in an Instagram post.  He said: \"When Life throws you lemons , catch em so they don\u2019t hit you in the f*****g face.\"  12 Zayn's Instagram post earlier today  While the couple have previously had an up and down relationship, my sources confirm this is now a formal split.  The source added: \u201cThis is definitely the end for now, but this isn\u2019t a bitter split and they both have respect for each other.  \u201cIt\u2019s a mutual decision so no one has completely ruled out a reunion in the future, but for now that\u2019s not where their heads are at.\u201d  The couple, who posed together for a Vogue photoshoot last July, had increasingly spent time apart.  Bradford-born Zayn, who now lives in Los Angeles, flew out to Florida at the end of February for a holiday while Gigi was working at Paris Fashion Week.  Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid walk hand-in-hand  Zayn started dating Gigi in November 2015, three months after he ended his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards, 24.  She had also split up with US pop heartthrob Joe Jonas, 28, just weeks before they got together.  The former 1D singer introduced himself to Gigi at a Victoria\u2019s Secret party and asked her on a date during their first meeting.  The model then appeared in the video for his first single after quitting Simon Cowell\u2019s boyband, the raunchy Pillowtalk, in January 2016.  After four years in 1D and a successful solo album, Zayn has a fortune of \u00a335million while Gigi is worth an estimated \u00a39.5million.  They made their first red carpet appearance together at the Met Gala in May that year.  She was also his rock during his struggle with anxiety and was with him in London in 2016 when he pulled out of Capital\u2019s Summertime Ball, minutes before he was due to headline.  12 Zayn started dating Gigi in November 2015 Credit: Getty - Contributor  12 Gigi appeared in Zayn's video for Pillowtalk Credit: Refer to Caption  12 Zayn introduced himself to Gigi at a Victoria\u2019s Secret party Credit: Splash News  12 Gigi and sister Bella at Paris Fashion Week Credit: Splash News  12 Zayn was on holiday in Florida last month Credit: Splash News  Last year they appeared in a Versace campaign together.  Speaking in September about how they dealt with dating in the spotlight, he said: \u201cI just concentrate on my relationship and try to do right by my girlfriend and she does by me, and we hope for the best, as we all do.\u201d  In January last year the pair sparked rumours they were engaged after being pictured with a diamond band on her ring finger.  It was later revealed they were not, but when Gigi\u2019s mum Yolanda was asked in January this year whether he would propose, she sounded hopeful.  12 Zayn used to date Little Mix's Perrie Edwards Credit: Splash News  12 Gigi and Zayn's Vogue shoot Credit: PA:Press Association  Zayn and Gigi loved-up on Vogue shoot  She said: \u201cWe'll see, I truly believe they're all on their own journey.

Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have been romantically linked since late 2015. The model appeared in Zayn's 2016 video for 'PILLOWTALK' and, though the two briefly split earlier this year, Zigi very much appears to be \"on\" at the moment.  Picture: Instagram Stories/Gigi Hadid  Unfortunately, with every public relationship comes scrutiny and even the odd \"fake couple\" accusation. Judging from a recent Instagram comment left by Gigi, the 23-year-old model has officially reached her limit with people accusing her and Zayn of being in a showmance.  Gigi has hit back at claims she and Zayn are in a fake relationship, calling the rumours \"negative\" and saying it would be her \"last comment on this matter\".  According to the model, an Instagram account dedicated to \"exposing\" the couple had been tagging Gigi in posts about her and Zayn's romance being for \"promo\".  Gigi delivered a measured response that even included a declaration of no \"hard feelings\" toward the person running the account.  Picture: via Gigi Hadid/Instagram  In the ultimate, 'i'm-not-angry-i'm-just-disappointed' move, Gigi wrote \"the energy you put into this does not serve your life in any way\" and urged the poster to \"go out and live\". Queen of mature clap backs.  Gigi also stated that she wasn't worried over whether Zayn was following her on Instagram because her eyes are tatted on his chest. Which, I mean, touch\u00e9, sis.  People backed Gigi's defense of her relationship.  Though, for the record, she shouldn't have to defend it to anyone.

'He has no family here and he's so far away so I understand that life because I lived that life. I think that I'm just a momma to him.'

In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: \u2018If Jesus Hasn\u2019t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan\u2019, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  \"You have to hustle. I\u2019m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y\u2019all the biggest one straight off...  \"If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.\"  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so \"believe in your dreams\", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  \"I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it\u2019s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.\u201d  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

The reported couple joined the entire Malik squad \u2014 including Zayn's mom, brother, and sister, Waliyha \u2014 to celebrate in the holy day, with Waliyah sharing some adorable pictures to Instagram of the intimate event. In one of the photos, Gigi is seen wearing an orange-and-black caftan over a pair of white pants, snuggling up to her boyfriend of two years. In another shot, Zayn receives a kiss on the cheek from his mom while throwing his arm over his sister's shoulder. Gigi's mom, Yolanda Hadid, shared the adorable photo of the couple to her story, too, which may mean that she was also in attendance.  Eid al-Adha, which took place on August 20\u201321, is also known as \"The Festival of Sacrifice\" or \"Big Eid,\" and it marks the end of the Hajj. It is one of the most important Muslim holidays of the year. Last year, Gigi and Zayn also celebrated the holiday with their families \u2014 including both of their moms.  As the daughter of an immigrant (her father, Mohamed Hadid, was born in Israel then lived in Syria and Lebanon before immigrating to the U.S. at age 14), Gigi has been outspoken about her pride in her Muslim roots. She appeared in a 2017 issue of Vogue Arabia wearing a hijab, and marched alongside her sister, Bella Hadid, at a New York City protest condemning Donald Trump's travel ban. In 2015, she posted an image of her hands covered in traditional mehndi to Instagram, captioning it \u201cHalf Palestinian & proud of it.\"  Zayn's family has roots in Pakistan, and he has been identified in the past by Britain's Evening Standard as \"the most high-profile British Muslim in the entertainment industry\" \u2014 something he is very proud of. \u201cI take a great sense of pride \u2014 and responsibility \u2014 in knowing that I am the first of my kind, from my background,\u201d he said of the accolade. \u201cI\u2019m not currently practicing, but I was raised in the Islamic faith, so it will always be with me, and I identify a lot with the culture.

She\u2019s beautiful, intelligent, talented, and just so many good things. There aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to sit down and count all of her virtues.  (Getty)  She\u2019s just the best, OK?  And if you\u2019re a human being who walks this earth, then you surely know that.  It just makes sense that since Rihanna is such a treasure to us all, she\u2019s even more special to the men she dates \u2014 and since last year, she\u2019s been dating billionaire Hassan Jameel.  Hassan is the deputy president and vice chairman of his family\u2019s company, which owns the rights to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia.  We don\u2019t know much more about him, since he and Rihanna have been keeping their relationship very private.  (Getty)  But we do know that they\u2019ve been dating for close to a year now, and that they definitely seem serious about each other.  So that\u2019s nice, right? It\u2019s good to see Rihanna with someone who isn\u2019t an aggressive, violent, hateful, scary douchebag.  And speaking of Chris Brown \u2026  It seems like while Chris isn\u2019t exactly an issue in Rihanna and Hassan\u2019s relationship, Hassan is concerned about him.  A source tells Hollywood Life that \"He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past.\"  (Getty)  Gee, wonder why?  \"Hassan doesn\u2019t trust Chris,\" the source adds, \"and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.\"  \"He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.\"  His concerns may be valid \u2014 another source claims that even after all this time and even though Rihanna has clearly moved on, Chris is still hung up on her.  \"Chris thinks Hassan is not good enough for Rihanna \u2014 but then, nobody would be good enough for her in his eyes,\" this insider states.  He\u2019s including himself in that, right? He can\u2019t think that he\u2019s good enough for her. Right?!  \"He thinks there\u2019s no way Rihanna would marry this dude, which is kinda funny really as he doesn\u2019t know Hassan at all,\" the source continues.  \"Chris just can\u2019t help it though, even after all these years, and all the water that\u2019s passed under the bridge, he still loves Rihanna to pieces and he still thinks of her as being his girl.\"  \"It\u2019s totally crazy, but Chris still holds out this belief that one day, somehow, he and Rihanna will get back together and live happily after,\" the insider concludes.  No wonder Hassan has some concerns.  Especially when Chris has referred to himself as a stalker in the past, and has made statements like \"If I love you, bitch, ain\u2019t nobody gonna have you, I\u2019m gonna make you miserable.\"  We\u2019d say we don\u2019t have the best feeling about this, but we never have good feelings when it comes to Chris Brown.",

Fans believed at first that the guy was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be a Saudi billionaire. He is the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the largest companies in the world. The Barbadian singer was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, 28, and it looks like her new beau fears that the \u201cWith You\u201d singer might win her back.  A source close to Rihanna, 29, recently told Hollywood Life that Jameel is worried that Brown keeps \u201clurking in her past\u201d and is being unpredictable. Although RiRi has opened up to her new beau about her past, the Toyota heir is still concerned that Breezy can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the \u201cKiss Kiss\u201d singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime.  However, a separate source previously told the same news outlet that Rihanna hopes that the well-heeled Saudi Arabian can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown. Now, fans are convinced that she has moved on gracefully from Breezy.

Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.\u201d  Although they also attended the Grammys after-party in New York City, the couple still tried to keep it low-key. They were spotted leaving the club separately, with Rihanna exiting the club right after Jameel had left.  Following her performance at the Grammys, some fans suggested that Rihanna is pregnant with Jameel\u2019s baby as her tight outfit appears to have shown a tiny baby bump. However, another insider also told Hollywood Life that the Barbadian singer is not pregnant, and is not trying to get pregnant either.

Fans initially believed that Jameel was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the world's largest companies. Rihanna was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, who she recently revealed to her new beau.\n\nJameel is reportedly worried that Brown is still lurking in Rihanna's past and is being unpredictable. While Rihanna has opened up to her new beau about her past, Jameel is still concerned that Brown can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the \"With You\" singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime. However, Rihanna hopes that Jameel can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown.\n\nJameel is worth $1.5 billion and is rumored to be pregnant with Rihanna's baby. However, sources have disputed this claim, and Rihanna is still focused on her career and has not yet met Jameel's family. Despite their low-key public appearances, Rihanna and Jameel have stepped out together at the Grammys and other events.\n\nMeanwhile, Zayn Malik has spoken out about his relationship with Gigi Hadid. He hates being called a \"power couple\" and wants to be in a relationship based on mutual love and liking, rather than just being a \"power couple.\" He has previously discussed how fame has been difficult for him, especially with his anxiety, but he copes by spending time with Hadid and relaxing at home.\n\nHadid has taken on some of Malik's Britishisms, including a love of pies. Malik revealed that he is a \"mean\" pie-maker, and has even started making his own pastry. Despite their busy schedules, the couple seem to be happy and in love.",

A source said: \u201cAs soon as Harry met Tess, there was an instant spark between them. They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food \u2014 and things turned romantic quickly. They\u2019ve been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he\u2019s already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale. This really seems different to Harry\u2019s past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn\u2019t want to risk messing this one up.\u201d  Ward has been dubbed \u201ccooking\u2019s new golden girl\u201d by fans. She released her first book, \u201cThe Naked Diet,\u201d in 2015 after being trained by top chefs in The Ritz and River Cottage.

Styles recently revealed that he is changing the way he dates women after failed relationships with Taylor Swift, Caroline Flack and Kendall Jenner.

Late on Saturday, the hotel heiress angrily stepped up in support of her brother Barron - who was allegedly beaten to a bloody pulp in Miami, Florida, by the Parent Trap star's friend - declaring the perpetrator will be made to 'pay'.  Paris may have been referring to Lohan, who Barr on believes 'masterminded' the attack which left him in hospital.  Thicker than water: Paris Hilton has vowed to make those involved in the alleged attack on her brother Barron, seen here together in Utah earlier this year, 'pay'  Paris broke her silence about the alleged attack by posting a comment on Barron's Instagram page.  Pictured on TMZ, the 32-year-old wrote alongside on a picture of her younger sibling's battered face saying: 'They both will pay for what they did.    'No one f***s with my family and gets away with it!!'  The alleged aftermath: Barron posted an image of the injuries he claims he received in the attack on Instagram  Barron was assaulted on Friday allegedly at the direction of Lindsay, who accused him of talking about her to her boyfriend while at a party held as part of the Maimi Art Basel event the previous evening.  The 24-year-old's face showed numerous cuts to his nose area and, according to TMZ, the hotel heir required hospital treatment including a CT scan on his head.  Late Saturday night Lindsay broke her silence about the alleged incident posting an image of her at the Shore Club making a reference to having a great time with 'honest, fun friends ... and no more bad folk'.

Nicky appeared to point the finger at Lindsay's friends, rather than the 27-year-old saying: 'Bad things happen when you hang out with bad people.'  While Paris turned to cosmic retribution writing: 'Karma's a b***h...'  There have yet to be any charges laid in relation to the alleged attack.  Lindsay initially denied being at the Shore Club pool where the assault reportedly happened, but video later emerged of Barron confronting the Mean Girls star as she left the venue.  It was reported the star had been asked to leave but she made sure to post pictures taken at the mansion - which has been turned into the Shore Club for the week.    Paris and Lindsay have a long history of being frenemies with the heiress being caught on film in 2006 making fun the Parent Trap star along with friend Brandon Davis - who infamously called Lindsay a 'firecrotch'.    While Paris may be looking for some sort of vengeance against her former pal, the reality star was not continuing all her feuds during the annual art event.

Paris may have been referring to Lohan, who Barron believes \"masterminded\" the attack which left him in hospital. Paris broke her silence about the alleged attack by posting a comment on Barron's Instagram page, writing: \"They both will pay for what they did. No one f***s with my family and gets away with it!!\" Barron was assaulted on Friday allegedly at the direction of Lindsay, who accused him of talking about her to her boyfriend while at a party held as part of the Miami Art Basel event the previous evening. The 24-year-old's face showed numerous cuts to his nose area and, according to TMZ, the hotel heir required hospital treatment including a CT scan on his head.\n\nLindsay made a vague reference to the alleged incident on Instagram on Saturday night but quickly deleted it just minutes after posting. The Mean Girls star initially denied being at the Shore Club pool where the assault reportedly happened, but video later emerged of Barron confronting the Mean Girls star as she left the venue. It was reported the star had been asked to leave but she made sure to post pictures taken at the mansion - which has been turned into the Shore Club for the week. Paris and Lindsay have a long history of being frenemies with Paris being caught on film in 2006 making fun of the Parent Trap star along with friend Brandon Davis - who infamously called Lindsay a 'firecrotch'. While Paris may be looking for some sort of vengeance against her former pal, the reality star was not continuing all her feuds during the annual art event. The socialite turned DJ spent Friday night with her former best friend, and Simple Life co-star, Nicole Richie, even posting a picture of the pair together on her Instagram with the hashtag old friends.\n\nThere have yet to be any charges laid in relation to the alleged attack. MailOnline contacted representatives for both Lindsay and Barron about the alleged incident but they have so far been unavailable for comment.",

The famous runway, which showcases the latest underwear from the Victoria\u2019s Secret brand, will captivate audiences around the world. But what is more memorable than the underwear? It's the falls, trips and slips live on TV, of course. The same fans who will tune in tomorrow night will remember last year\u2019s show in Shanghai where the undoubtably stunning Ming Xi had a minor mishap on the runway. Ming Xi, a Victoria\u2019s Secret model, tripped over on the catwalk after catching her foot in the train of her outfit - and hit the floor with her hands and knees.  Model Ming Xi fell over on the Victoria's Secret catwalk in 2017  The Chinese model, 28 at the time, was left red-faced when her boot heel became caught in her long flowing cape. After spending a few seconds on the ground, she was kindly helped up by her colleague Bruna Lirio, 23. Ming didn\u2019t let the incident ruin her walk, and she managed to keep smiling throughout. It wasn\u2019t until she got backstage that the tears were flowing. The model later responded to the reaction around her slip - which was huge around the world. She wrote: \u201cAs many of you may already know, I fell during my 5th year walking at the Victoria's Secret show yesterday. It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes.

After the Barbadian singer heated up the internet with her photos with Hassan Jameel, the Canadian rapper reportedly reacted and said that he is wondering why his former girlfriend fell for the Arabian business tycoon.  Drake is reportedly starting to regret letting go of RiRi  A source told Hollywood Life that the \"Thank Me Later\" artist was \"kinda jealous\" when he found out that his ex-girlfriend is already seeing a new guy. \u201cDrake is kinda jealous of Rihanna\u2019s new billionaire boyfriend.  He has no idea why she likes this guy,\u201d it said.  It added that despite their on-off relationship, the 30-year-old rapper is still affected whenever the \"What's My Name\" singer is caught up in dating rumors. \u201cDrake thinks Rihanna is one of the baddest chicks\u2019s ever and he doesn\u2019t think this new guy deserves her at all,\u201d the insider added.  Aside from him, rumor has it that Naomi Campbell, who previously dated Hassan, was \"furious\" when she saw her ex-boyfriend getting cozy with her former bestie. The English model reportedly said that she is still \"hotter and more successful\" than RiRi and guaranteed that her relationship with him won't last long.  This rumor has caused the fans to speculate about Campbell and Rihanna's stained friendship which was first noticed by an eagle-eyed fan who figured out that the two have stopped following each other on social media earlier this year.  When asked if she has a beef with her best friend, the 47-year-old model suggested that she is just pretending that everything is fine between them.  Rihanna and Hassan's Ibiza getaway  RiRi and Hassan, both 29, were first seen in public during their romantic vacation in Spain on Wednesday. Several photos of them getting all steamy in the swimming pool immediately went viral and had caused the public to start digging about the new guy.  It was later revealed that he is the expected heir of a $1.5 billion business called Abdul Latif Jameel which has acquired the distribution rights to Toyota in Saudi Arabia.  Their family business has placed them in 12th spot on the list of richest Arabs in the world by Forbes. Hassan currently works as the Deputy President and Vice Chairman of the said company.  Aside from that, his family also owns Saudi Professional League or Jameel League which was founded in 1976.  After spending some down time at their luxury villa, Rihanna and her billionaire beau stepped out in public on the same day, where the singer was seen holding a bouquet of flowers while her the tycoon was all smiles walking behind his girl.",

Gigi Hadid carried a puppy on the runway at Milan Fashion Week, and some people pissed. And after you find out the details, you might be, too.  As Teen Vogue pointed out, when Hadid walked in accessory designer Tod\u2019s show, she proudly carried a live French Bulldog by her side as she showed off a cozy brown coat and matching oversized bag. Hadid looked amazing and smiled the whole time, as most of us do when we\u2019re in the presence of a puppy. And speaking of the puppies? Well, they were ridiculously adorable. However, people are wondering if puppies being used as accessories crosses a line somewhere. This is especially the case since the designer does use real leather in his designs\u2026which comes from other live animals.  To be totally fair, Hadid wasn\u2019t the only one carrying a puppy down the runway \u2014 it was part of the designer\u2019s vision for the show, and many of the other models hit the runway with puppies in tow. But right now, she\u2019s getting all the heat. Twitter is already ripping her for it.  Gigi-with-puppy at Tod's. Interesting accessory choice for a leather house.... pic.twitter.com/YHyMYHM5wu \u2014 Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 23, 2018  Tod's had puppies on the runway!!! DOGS! (Also Tod's uses animal leather for their clothing so this also feels kinda creepy) \u2014 paz (@breadpeas__) February 23, 2018  tod\u2019s is a leather house and they used puppies as an accessory on the runway and i\u2019m uncomfortable \u2014 caroline (@carolinenycek) February 23, 2018  The Sun    Animal charity slams models including Gigi Hadid for using dogs as accessories on the catwalk  The Sun  Animal charities and dog lovers weren't keen on the fashion house treating animals like a chic fashion accessory. Animal activist Felicity Harl\u2026 https://t.co/zZCIQOort1 pic.twitter.com/uVk19sucIG \u2014 Puppy Training Tips (@puppy_training_) February 23, 2018  People are definitely making good points in these tweets, but Hadid was also just doing her job. She was working for the designer by walking in the show and followed directions by carrying the dog. There\u2019s no evidence that these dogs were harmed or mistreated \u2014 although, in the middle of a fashion show surrounded by people and bright lights, there was definitely the possibility for chaos.  In the end, everyone made it out unscathed, and these puppies got a few extra cuddles that day.  Judging by this backlash, it\u2019d be surprising if puppies ever make an appearance at fashion week again. Kind of a bummer, but maybe it\u2019s what\u2019s best for them. Anyone else suddenly dying to go out and get a good boy of their own?",

Lindsay Lohan made the confounding decision to accompany a sultry Instagram with a caption expressing sympathy for victims of terrorist attacks in Nice and Turkey. She calls on her fans, who deserve so much more to show for their years of loyalty, to \"#turnup and do something (goodnight and sleep with an idea for the future).\"  Her heart could have been in the right place, even if her head certainly was not. Maybe she genuinely thought a cute selfie would help usher in an era of peace and goodwill amongst men.  Of course, we're just assuming this is Lindsay. Maybe she swapped places with her long-lost twin sister. Or she could have swapped bodies with Dina Lohan! Or maybe she's just pretending to infiltrate the world of clueless celebrities so she can take them down one by one, but she totally plans to go back to hanging out with Janis and Damian when it's all over! Can we blame Herbie for this mess? Certainly!  If Lindsay Lohan's career were to be folded ... where would we put the crease?  Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.",
        "generated_text": "Recently, two controversies have sparked heated discussions among the public. In one incident, Mischa Barton used an Instagram post to express sympathy for the victims of terrorist attacks in Nice and Turkey, accompanied by a sultry caption and a selfie. On the other hand, Gigi Hadid carried a live French Bulldog on the runway at Milan Fashion Week, which has sparked debates about the ethics of using puppies as accessories in the fashion industry.\n\nBoth incidents have received criticism from animal lovers and charities, who argue that using animals as fashion accessories crosses a moral line. While Mischa Barton may have had good intentions, her decision to use a selfie to express her message has been met with mixed reactions. On the other hand, Gigi Hadid was simply doing her job as a model and followed the designer's instructions. However, the backlash to her decision has been significant, with many expressing their discomfort at the use of animals as fashion accessories.\n\nIt is important to note that both incidents were part of a larger picture, with Tod's using animals in their designs and the models carrying the animals as part of the designer's vision for the show. While some may argue that puppies being used as accessories crosses a line, it is also important to consider the bigger picture and the designer's intentions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use animals as fashion accessories is a subjective one, and it is up to each individual to decide whether they can tolerate such practices. However, it is clear that the use of animals in fashion has sparked a debate, and it is up to the industry to consider the ethical implications of such practices.",

        "doc_2_text": "While known as the reserved one in the clan, Kendall Jenner has allegedly morphed into a terrifying employer. The latest report from OK! via Gossip Cop alleges that the Victoria\u2019s Secret model is a \u201cboss from hell\u201d who makes life tough for the people who work for her.  \u201cEveryone thinks she\u2019s the sweetest, shyest Kardashian sister, but over the last year she\u2019s made so much money and won so much praise that it\u2019s gone to her head.\u201d  The magazine\u2019s so-called insider recalled an instance when Kendall\u2019s assistant served her the wrong kind of iced tea and instead of being grateful, Kendall reportedly \u201cmade her pay for a new one out of pocket.\u201d The insider also purported that the runway model would fire employees who would attempt to talk about her behind her back. What she allegedly does is to tell her mother, Kris Jenner, that the employee is incompetent.  However, Gossip Cop shed some light on the issue and confirmed through a source close to Kendall that the magazine\u2019s claims are unfounded. As someone who has firsthand experiences of bullying, it isn\u2019t fair if Kendall would do the same to her team.  Just last month, Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Adriana Lima defended Kendall from bullies and acknowledged her pleasant attitude. She told E! Online that Kendall works just as hard as other models in the industry.  \u201cI have worked with Kendall on runways before when we were in Europe, like Versace and also with Victoria\u2019s Secret. Kendall is very sweet and very nice, and it\u2019s always pleasant to work with someone like that. You know, she works as hard as we do, so I give her credit for all the effort. And I think she is going to do great because Victoria\u2019s Secret is all about personality, and she has her own personality.\u201d  In a previous interview with Garage magazine via E! Online, Kendall also revealed that she\u2019s been following the Golden Rule since she was young.  \u201cI aim to treat others as I want to be treated. I know that sounds slightly basic, but when it comes to humans and human nature, the simplest answer is usually the right one. It really is as easy as that.\u201d  She understands that everyone is entitled to have an opinion, but she chooses not to focus her energy on dealing with the ruthless things said about her.  When she was still starting, some models allegedly bullied Kendall as they believed that it was only because of her famous last name that she managed to get a spot in the competitive industry. Some were reportedly complaining that she only bought her career, and she was undeserving of the special treatment from major designers.  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star then opted to drop her last name and simply go by \u201cKendall\u201d when working. As much as possible, she also does want her family members to watch her shows.  Last year, Kendall admitted through the reality show that she\u2019s having a difficult time working because of her sleep paralysis. Since the paralysis often happens when she\u2019s on the plane, she\u2019s starting to develop a fear of traveling; something which Kris finds alarming.  \u201cThe nature of what you do for a living and your career is flying around the world. You have designers that have already booked you and are counting on you to show up,\u201d she told her daughter. Kendall responded that perhaps her health is more significant than those jobs.  Apart from meeting with a therapist, Kim Kardashian also arranged a meditation for her younger sister upon learning about Kendall\u2019s dilemma.

However, Gossip Cop has debunked these claims, stating that they are unfounded.

Tears pour out of my eyes, roll across my cheeks, and meld with the salt water as I try to still my mind to become one with the water's ebb and flow.\"  She continues: \"God please just take me away in a wave,\" she writes. \"I can't live like this one more day. Please carry my body away. I just want to disappear.\" She went on to say: \"My next thought is a clear image of my three children. It shifts my consciousness immediately and that's the only thing that keeps me from letting myself drift and drown.\"  During this time two years ago, Yolanda's illness was forcing her to stay in bed for up to 22 hours a day because of painful symptoms such as joint pain, exhaustion, and insomnia, according to People. Even answering an email became a daunting task, making her feel severely depressed. Her physical and mental health was at an all-time low.

She always looks amazing, she's mega talented, and she has a badass attitude about life. Do not come for Rihanna or I will come for you. If RiRi is hanging out with someone, especially a potential boyfriend, you best believe fans will jump all over it... or so you would think. Her latest rumored relationship has managed to stay surprisingly low-key. Who is Rihanna dating? His name is Hassan Jameel and the two have been linked together for about seven months.  Back in June of 2017, photos were released of RiRi getting hot and heavy with Jameel in a hot tub. The photos have since been deleted, but people were mostly wondering who the heck this seemingly random guy with Rihanna was in Spain.  As it turns out, Jameel is extremely well-known throughout the world. As the Toyota heir, he's wealthy \u2014 like, really wealthy. For 80 years, Jameel's family has been, \"the sole owners of the right to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia,\" according to COED. This results in his net worth sitting at a hefty $1.5 billion.  In addition, the 29-year-old also serves as the deputy president and vice chairman of his family's company, Abdul Latif Jameel. According to Daily Mail, this is one of the biggest companies in the entire world.  Money is great, but I don't think it matters to Rihanna one bit. With her own net worth at $36 million, according to Forbes, she can take care of her own damn self. This relationship is definitely rooted in good ol' fashioned chemistry. According to a source from Daily Mail, Rihanna is \"smitten\" with Jameel. The source said,  This relationship is the real deal. Rihanna has told friends she's in love with him and seems completely smitten. They've been spending a lot of time together away from prying eyes and are really serious. They're really enjoying each others' company.  Like I said earlier, all this info came to the surface back in June. After a quick obsession session, everyone moved on to other things. Rihanna, Jameel, and their potential relationship was swept under the rug, and I didn't know if we would ever hear from them again.  That is, until the 2018 Grammys. After Rihanna won her Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration with Kendrick Lamar and performed \"Wild Thoughts\" with DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller, she went out to celebrate.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  According to E! News, Rihanna and Jameel were both seen at the famous 1 OAK nightclub in NYC. Although they arrived and were photographed separately, sources claim the two were \"coupled up\" all night. A source said the two weren't afraid to flaunt a little PDA, and Rihanna \"seemed so happy\" with Jameel. The source told E!,  Rihanna and Hassan showed affection throughout the evening. It was cool because he can roll with Rihanna, he fits in great.  The source continued,  He was always making sure she was OK and had everything she needed. Rihanna was dancing and having a great time.  The two sound like a fabulous couple. Another eyewitness account of the two came from realtor and famous NYC and Miami socialite, Malcolm Edwards. He exclusively told E!,  Rihanna was sitting with her boyfriend Hassan at 1 OAK owner Richie Akiva's table. They weren't being overly romantic but definitely showed some PDA throughout the night. They were happy to see Diddy and his girlfriend Cassie when they showed up at the table. They hugged and kissed hello. The foursome laughed throughout the night and enjoyed music.  At the owner's table with Diddy... no biggie. Just a day in the life of Rihanna. The two being friends with other couples could prove that their relationship is getting serious. Hopefully, we'll be hearing more about Rihanna and Jameel in the near future.  Basically, if Rihanna is happy, I'm happy. It's so exciting the singer may have a new-ish man in her life to celebrate the good stuff. NOTHING BUT GOOD THOUGHTS AND WISHES FOR RIRI.

The comment in question said: \"I will be a proud grandma in eight months. Life is a blessing.\"  As it turns out, it seems like that comment might have been the work of Photoshop, since the real Yolanda Hadid took to Twitter last night to clear everything up \u2014 and she made a pretty good point in the process. \"No of course not,\" Yolanda wrote in response to a fan who asked if the rumor was true. \"If my daughter was pregnant, she would be the one to announce it not me,\" she added.

        "generated_text": "This week, social media was abuzz with rumors that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik were expecting a baby. The rumors began when an Instagram comment purportedly written by Gigi's mother, Yolanda Hadid, started making the rounds on social media. The comment read, \"I will be a proud grandma in eight months. Life is a blessing.\" However, Yolanda Hadid quickly clarified the situation on Twitter, stating that \"No of course not. If my daughter was pregnant, she would be the one to announce it not me.\" She was 100% right, as it would be Gigi's news to share, not anyone else's.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder that we should not believe everything we see on the internet, even if it seems like a legitimate screenshot from social media. Images can be altered, and sometimes Photoshop is very convincing. Ultimately, we need to listen to the stars themselves. In this case, it seems like Yolanda Hadid made herself pretty clear.\n\nMeanwhile, Conrad Hilton, Paris Hilton's younger brother, was sentenced to three years probation after an outburst during a flight from London to Los Angeles. He was also ordered to pay a $5,000 fine, undertake 750 hours of community service, and have mental health and substance abuse treatment. During his court appearance, Hilton apologized for his conduct and vowed it wouldn't happen again. His lawyer attributed his actions to an adverse reaction to a sleeping pill.\n\nHilton's sentencing came after he was placed under house arrest last month until his sentencing, after breaking his $100,000 bail by failing a drugs test and smoking marijuana. newly released court documents filed in California state that the conditions of his pretrial release are hereby amended to include a curfew restricting him to his residence every day from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. All other pretrial conditions will remain in effect as previously ordered.",

The 22-year-old was spotted making out with fellow model Anwar Hadid, 18, at the Socialista New York club following the CFDA Awards in New York on June 4.

Kendall has not been one to be super physical with a guy in any of her relationships so the fact that she was all over Anwar is a good sign that there might be more to come from these two. Even if it is a little weird that he\u2019s the little brother of her pals Gigi, 23, and Bella Hadid, 21.

RELATED STORY (Image credit: Getty Images) Harry Styles' Dancing Is the Best Part of VSFS  Onstage at one of his concerts the other night, Styles mentioned Swift in such a sly way, that fans are already praying for a reunion. Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, \"22.\" It's not hard to guess what happened next.  Announcing the news to the audience, Styles said, \"22. She\u2019s 22, okay? I don\u2019t know about...\" And as every Swift fan knows, that's exactly how the lyrics to \"22\" go.

Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that\u2019s the case. Let\u2019s take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she\u2019s listening to Cardi B\u2018s \u201cBe Careful,\u201d perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper\u2019s recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy. In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fianc\u00e9 Offset\u2019s infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. \u201cPoured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,\u201d she raps, \u201cMan, I thought you would\u2019ve learned your lesson\u2026./ Said that you was workin\u2019, but you out here chasin\u2019 culo/ And putas, chillin\u2019 poolside, livin\u2019 two lives\u2026./ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s a warnin\u2019.\u201d Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: \u201cThe queen.\u201d  instagram.com/chloegmoretz  What\u2019s more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption \u201cGreetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,\u201d as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption \u201cChloe\u2019s fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.\u201d  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn\u2019t officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup, saying that she just wanted to hide. \u201cThey were like, \u2018That\u2019s all great that you want to go away\u2014but you can\u2019t. You are your own person,'\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.\u2019 I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren\u2019t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.\u201d With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple.",

He does not want his daughter to be treated like an accessory and wants her to know that she is not entitled to anything.

Following the intimate moment, TMZ published a grainy photo of the 22-year-old straddling Anwar during their kiss at Socialista New York, which according to the publication lasted two hours and ended around 4am when the model left on her own.  Yes, two hours. That\u2019s the equivalent of two episodes of Love Island. In other words - dedication.

But, they\u2019re reportedly protecting their massive fortunes first.  The first sign of true love and trust is an iron-clad prenup, right? Well, according to a new report, both Rihanna, 29, and her new rumored boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, 29, are in the midst of planning a wedding! However, business is business. \u201cEverything is moving so fast, but right now the priority is working out their individual assets with their attorneys in order to write up an ironclad contract,\u201d a source tells Life & Style magazine. So, what numbers are we exactly working with, here? Rihanna and Hassan are reportedly hashing out a prenup worth more than $1 billion; you know, nine zeros\u2026  \u201cThey\u2019re crazy about each other, but they both know that a prenup is a good idea,\u201d the insider says.

        "doc_1_text": "Ever since Scorpion was released, fans have been trying to figure out what some of Drake's lyrics mean in his many new tracks. Well, one song in particular has some wondering about a romance with a famous model. As E! News noted, Drake may hint at a romance with Bella Hadid in the song, \"Finesse.\" While neither party has confirmed anything regarding any relationship rumors, the rapper's lyrics in the song could shed some light on the situation. (Bustle reached out to Drake and Hadid's reps for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.)  Update: Hadid responded to the rumors via Twitter later on June 29, tweeting the following in response to a fan:  Not me!!! [shrug emoji] that\u2019s disrespectful. WHY CANT PPL BE FRIENDS W/o all the insinuation  Earlier: In \"Finesse,\" he sings, \"You stay on my mind / all the time, all the time\" and \"I would make time for you / Commitment.\" So, it would seem like he had some strong feelings about the person in question. While he doesn't give any overt clues as to who he's talking about, based on subsequent lyrics, he may be referring to a model. And who's one of the most famous supermodels in the world right now? Hadid.  \"I want my baby to have your eyes / I'm going against my own advice / Should I do New York? I can't decide/Fashion week is more your thing than mine,\" he sang. Since Hadid has appeared in her fair share of Fashion Week shows, it would make sense if this lyric ties back to her.  Additionally, he says in the song, \"You and your sister / Too hot to handle.\" It's pretty obvious that, if he is talking about Hadid, this would be a nod to her sister and fellow model, Gigi Hadid. There are so many possible connections to the model that could point to a romance between the two. But, until Drake clarifies things himself, one can only infer what the lyrics may stand for.  Michael Loccisano/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  But, what if \"Finesse\" is in reference to yet another famous model? Based on the lyrics of the song, it's also possible that it could point to a potential romance between Drake and Kendall Jenner. She checks off all of the same boxes as her friend Hadid does in this great \"Finesse\" mystery.  Has a thing for Fashion Week? Check. Equally famous sister? Check (on multiple accounts, but likely would be about Kylie Jenner). Past romance rumors? Another check. In December 2015, Jenner and Drake were spotted getting a little close at Kris Jenner's annual Christmas party, which sparked some romance rumors. Although, neither of them have touched upon said rumors.  However, given the more recent relationship rumors with Drake and Hadid, there's a better case for \"Finesse\" being in reference to her (if it's referencing anyone particularly well known at all).  Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  According to Us Weekly, Drake threw Hadid a 21st birthday party in October 2017. While the publication reported that he planned the festivities because he's a \"close friend\" of the model's, that didn't stop some from wondering if the party meant that the two were an item. A subsequent Us Weekly story, published shortly after the party took place, clarified things about their relationship. A source told the publication that they were \"definitely\" not dating.  Hadid's mother, Yolanda Hadid, also stepped in to clear things up about her daughter and the \"Hotline Bling\" rapper. During her appearance on Watch What Happens Live, host Andy Cohen asked the former Housewife about the rumors. She replied, while chuckling, \"Are you kidding?\" When Cohen brought up that Drake threw her a birthday party, she tried to play coy but eventually said, \"I mean, they're friends.\"  Still, neither Hadid nor Drake have outright commented on any of the dating rumors. So, for any shippers of them out there, you may just have to settle for some possible references to a romance in one of the singer's newest releases from Scorpion, \"Finesse.\"",

Levi is on the same wavelength and they both plan on being together forever, so why not start forever sooner than later. The couple has been together since November 2016 and have proven that they are the most normal couple in Hollywood by grocery shopping, walking dogs, and supporting each other in their careers. Ariel is preparing to film the final season of Modern Family, while Levi just celebrated the opening of his film with Gabrielle Union. Levi admits that dating Ariel helps him navigate the industry and he considers her a friend and confidante. Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik, former couple, were spotted kissing in New York, sparking rumors of a reconciliation. Malik visited Hadid at home and was spotted leaving in the same clothes earlier this month, according to People. The couple announced their split in March after two years of dating. Malik confirmed on the April 13 episode of On Air with Ryan Seacrest that his new single, \"Let Me,\" was inspired by Hadid.",

There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you are feeling or to make this better,\u201d she began. \u201cHowever, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way. The only thing we can do now is choose how we let this affect us and how we live our lives from here on out.\u201d  \u201cI am sorry for the pain and fear that you must be feeling and for the trauma that you, too, must be experiencing,\u201d she continued.  \u201cWe will never be able to understand why events like this take place because it is not in our nature, which is why we shouldn\u2019t recoil. We will not quit or operate in fear. We won\u2019t let this divide us. We won\u2019t let hate win.\u201d  Grande then revealed her plans to return to Manchester to perform a benefit concert.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to go the rest of the year without being able to see and hold and uplift my fans, the same way they continue to uplift me. Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before,\u201d she said.  \u201cI\u2019ll be returning to the incredibly brave city of Manchester to spend time with my fans and to have a benefit concert in honor of and to raise money for the victims and their families.  \u201cI want to thank my fellow musicians and friends for reaching out to be a part of our expression of love for Manchester.

        "doc_2_text": "Ariana Grande is safely back in the U.S. after the suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester. But there are some rumors swirling around about the way she got back home.  The Daily Mail reported that Taylor Swift loaned Grande her plane so that the former Disney star could get back to the States.  \u201cShe then made her way back home with a little help from Taylor Swift, who lent Ariana a private plane so that she could make a quick return to the U.S.,\u201d The Daily Mail article said.  However, although it\u2019s nice to think that Taylor Swift was kind enough to lend her fellow pop star a plane so that she could get home safely, Gossip Cop is crying foul over that story.  The site, well known for debunking celebrity rumors, says that that part of the story is completely made up.  According to Gossip Cop, Grande came home on a private flight which was arrange by her manager Scooter Braun and Live Nation. Rapper Mac Miller, Ariana\u2019s boyfriend, was there to greet the pop star and her mother when they landed.  We\u2019re not sure why The Daily Mail would include a mention of Taylor Swift in the story since it\u2019s not at all relevant to anything else about the bombing at Ariana Grande\u2019s concert.  According to The Telegraph, the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena was carried out by a man named Salman Abedi. The attack killed 22 people, the youngest of whom was an eight-year-old girl. Dozens of concert goers were injured.  The bomb, which was packed with nuts and bolts, went off just moments after Ariana finished the last song in her set. ISIS has since taken credit for the carnage.  In the aftermath of the bombing, British Prime Minister, Theresa May, increased the terrorist threat level in the UK from severe to critical. She also said that there will be an increased military presence at public events.  Abedi was 22 years old and of Libya descent. He was born in Manchester and studied business at Salisbury college. However, he did not complete his degree. The Telegraph reports that he was the youngest of four children whose parents fled Libya during Colonel Moammar Gaddafi\u2019s regime. According to a family friend he was in Libya a couple of weeks ago. Another friend said that he was a \u201cfriendly\u201d guy.  \u201cHe was always friendly, nothing to suggest (he was violent). He was normal, to be honest\u201d  U.S President Donald Trump, who\u2019s currently on his first foreign tour as head of state, called the terrorists responsible for the Manchester bombing \u201cevil losers\u201d and offered America\u2019s \u201cabsolute solidarity\u201d with the people of the UK.  \"Our hearts go out to those killed and wounded\": Obama and the Clintons shared condolences on the Manchester attack https://t.co/zvtMLvu7ln pic.twitter.com/bH4EkQutQ5 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) May 24, 2017  The Telegraph claims that Abedi was recently radicalized but they are not sure when he joined ISIS. His imam said that he had shown him \u201cthe face of hate\u201d during a speech where he had warned his congregation about the danger of ISIS.  Ariana Grande has since commented on the devastating attack on Twitter.  \u201cBroken,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry.
