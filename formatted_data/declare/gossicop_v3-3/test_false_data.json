In a Facebook post on Saturday, Sept. 30, the singer declares that he \"certainly did not have a heart attack or a seizure,\" and goes on to explain that he had to cancel the tour in order to have a procedure that could only be done in the United States. His full statement is embedded below.  Our original story, posted 9/28:  According to the Boston Globe, the 69-year-old singer suffered a seizure after the band's concert in Sao Paulo on Sept. 25. The paper notes that it\u2019s \"not clear what caused the seizure or if Tyler received a diagnosis before flying back to the States.\"  Aerosmith canceled a number of dates on their current tour following what was then referred to as Tyler's undisclosed illness.

I flew back to the U.S. on doctor's orders last night after the show in S\u00e3o Paulo.\"  The Boston Globe reports that a source close to the band said Tyler had suffered a seizure, a clarification of a medical issue Tyler didn't identify earlier this week. \"Please not to worry,\" Tyler wrote. \"I am not in a life-threatening condition, but I need to deal with this right away and get some rest and medical care immediately in order to sustain and maintain my future performances. I promise I'll be back. Unfortunately, health does not wait and it's something even I can't schedule around our shows. As they say, 'We humans make plans, and God laughs.' I love you all and will be back with you soon.\"  Aerosmith have been hit with other medical problems lately.

Taylor\u2019s team have had the five star Lowry Hotel in Salford booked out since Sunday ahead of her concerts at the Etihad Stadium this weekend.  It is understood Taylor will fly into the city today, but many of her crew and entourage have already set up base at the hotel this week ready for her anticipated arrival this afternoon.  It has been widely known on the city\u2019s hotel circuit that Taylor\u2019s team had booked out the entire 165-room Lowry Hotel this week.  Not least because it has caused something of a headache for other visiting VIPs and superstars jetting in to the city.  That includes the host of sporting superstars and celebrities lining up for the big Soccer Aid match taking place at Old Trafford on Sunday, music megastars at Parklife, and the big fight at Manchester Arena as Tyson Fury returns to the ring.

Manchester\u2019s other five star hotels, Hotel Gotham on King Street and the Radisson Blu Edwardian on Peter Street, are expected to be at capacity over the weekend.  It\u2019s not known how much it costs to book out the entire Lowry Hotel for exclusive use.

        "doc_1_text": "All of the awards shows in 2017, from the Oscars to the Golden Globes to the Tonys to the VMAs, have been about much more than Hollywood's elite celebrating professional achievements. Celebs have been wearing blue ACLU ribbons with their couture outfits at these ceremonies to make a statement about human rights \u2014 and the 2017 Emmys are no different.  The Emmys are just another amazing instance of stars using these highly publicized events as a platform to call attention to crucial issues that affect us all, especially people of marginalized identities.  The blue ribbons advance an important message that makes them just as beautiful \u2014 if not more beautiful\u2014 than the diamond necklaces, earrings, and bracelets that drip from the necks, ears, and arms of those who walk the red carpet.  The blue ACLU ribbons, which were worn by everyone from actor Elisabeth Moss to Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi and more, show support of the \"Stand With ACLU\" initiative. According to The Hollywood Reporter, this particular program encourages Hollywood's elite to wear the ribbon to award shows as a sign solidarity with the organization, which works tirelessly \"to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\"  We cannot underestimate the importance or the value of the ACLU's work, especially in this social and political climate. Celebs are making the ACLU's efforts even more visible by proudly sporting the nonprofit on the red carpet. Here's all the celebs making a statement on the Emmys red carpet.  1. Padma Lakshmi  MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images  Lakshmi paired her hot pink gown, which boasted a fishtail silhouette, with the blue ribbon affixed to her hip. The placement of the ribbon certainly made it impossible to ignore.  2. Kathryn Hahn  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The always hilarious actor added the blue ribbon to her strapless black and polka dot column frock and it was the only accessory she needed.  3. Emily V. Gordon & Kumail Nanjiani  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Silicon Valley star Kumail Nanjiani and his writer/producer/podcast host wife Emily V. Gordon both proudly displayed their blue ribbons. The couple that accessorizes together, stays together.  4. Judith Light  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Former Who's the Boss and current Transparent star Judith Light had a va-va-voom moment with her long-sleeved black dress, which featured a slit that showed off her leg for days a la Angelina Jolie at the 2012 Academy Awards. Light's blue ribbon was exactly the touch she needed to top off her gown.  5. Pamela Adlon  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The actor wore a black pantsuit with gold accessories, but the blue one was the best.  6. Elisabeth Moss  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Handmaid's Tale star added her blue ribbon to her pink clutch, which matched her strapless, millennial pink frock. The pop of blue broke up her all blush look with a bold statement.  7. Anthony Anderson  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Blackish actor added just the right flash of color to his white tux jacket. The accessory was predictable coming from the lead actor on a show about race and black culture.  8. Riz Ahmed  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Writer and actor Riz Ahmed dressed up the lapel of his black tux with the statement-making ribbon, which speaks at such a high volume.  9. Ann Dowd  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Longtime actor (and newly-minted Emmy winner) Ann Dowd of The Handmaid's Tale also wore her blue ribbon on her black dress in full plain view for all to see.  10. Mandy Patinkin  Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The noted Homeland actor was seen with the ribbon, too.  The simple ACLU ribbon ended up being the most eye-catching accessory of the evening. Sorry not sorry to all those sparkling Harry Winston diamonds. After all, remembering and fighting for our civil liberties is always in style. And a touch of blue goes with everything.",

Linnetz wrote on Instagram that the series is titled, The 25 Days of Xmas. On Dec. 1, Kim posted the first image: a photo of son Saint, 2, in denim jeans as he posed by neatly wrapped brown presents with white ribbon. It\u2019s the toddler\u2019s first holiday card, as he was only a few weeks old when sister North and cousins Penelope, Mason and Reign Disick starred in the 2015 photo wearing coordinating chic black outfits. (The family opted to not release a card in 2016.)  02 of 25 DAY 2 Eli Russell Linnetz Kim's daughter North, 4, was the star of day two, caught in a cute moment of looking up at her mom.  03 of 25 DAY 3 Eli Russell Linnetz Dec. 3 belonged to 2-year-old Reign, the youngest child of Kourtney Kardashian and her former boyfriend Scott Disick.  04 of 25 DAY 4 Eli Russell Linnetz North and her mama made second appearances in the card on day four.  05 of 25 DAY 5 Eli Russell Linnetz The perfect way to celebrate Saint's 2nd birthday?

On Tuesday afternoon, the 20-year-old reality star shared the first photo of her baby girl holding her finger. She captioned the Instagram shot, \"Stormi.\"  Kim Kardashian followed the photo up with a tweet of her own, confirming the name with a simple emoji:  Kylie and Travis Scott welcomed their baby girl at Cedars-Sinani in Los Angeles on Thursday, Feb. 1, the same hospital Kylie's nieces and nephews were born.  After keeping her pregnancy completely under wraps for 9 months, Kylie confirmed the news on Sunday before the Super Bowl, calling it \"the most beautiful, empowering, and life changing experience I've had in my entire life.\"  Unfortunately for Kylie, Twitter seems to think her baby's name sounds a bit like the name of the porn star President Donald Trump may or may not have paid to keep quiet, Stormy Daniels. Others are cracking jokes about a Kardahian/Jenner family's weather-releated names, writing things like, \"It's going to be Stormi, with a chance of Reign, in the North of Chicago.\"  See the most savage reactions to the news below:  Big year for people named Stormi/Stormy pic.twitter.com/qg4ZFkmpdr @jtylerconway  Conspiracy Theory: Kylie had her baby last month before the Stormy Daniels story broke.

Linnetz wrote on Instagram that the series is titled, The 25 Days of Xmas. On Dec. 1, Kim posted the first image: a photo of son Saint, 2, in denim jeans as he posed by neatly wrapped brown presents with white ribbon. It\u2019s the toddler\u2019s first holiday card, as he was only a few weeks old when sister North and cousins Penelope, Mason and Reign Disick starred in the 2015 photo wearing coordinating chic black outfits. (The family opted to not release a card in 2016.)  02 of 25 DAY 2 Eli Russell Linnetz Kim's daughter North, 4, was the star of day two, caught in a cute moment of looking up at her mom.  03 of 25 DAY 3 Eli Russell Linnetz Dec. 3 belonged to 2-year-old Reign, the youngest child of Kourtney Kardashian and her former boyfriend Scott Disick.  04 of 25 DAY 4 Eli Russell Linnetz North and her mama made second appearances in the card on day four.  05 of 25 DAY 5 Eli Russell Linnetz The perfect way to celebrate Saint's 2nd birthday?

Kim organized 2017\u2019s shoot, she revealed during her November appearance on The Late Late Show. \u201cThis year\u2019s Christmas card is shot really casually. We\u2019re kind of doing jeans and T-shirts vibe. Really cute. All the kids and so hard to put together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s women and children this year.\u201d  08 of 25 DAY 8 Eli Russell Linnetz It was again a North and Saint day, with the kiddos coming together for the first time \u2014 and cuddling up to mom.

They show a fun, festive affair, with West looking relaxed and having fun as world-class mentalist Lior Suchard completely destroyed some minds in the room with some spectacular visual illusions, suggestive powers and what looks suspiciously like some legit mind reading and telekinesis.

West looked comfortable holding court, at one point, sitting on a couch and just taking everything in as his music played.  And then, there were those lattes with Kanye's face made into the foam.

And he helped stoke more family drama on his new album by rapping about the cheating scandal involving Tristan Thompson. And Donda's House, a charity he co-founded in honor of his late mother, Donda West, to help the youth in Chicago, formally dropped her name because of a dispute over his alleged lack of involvement and interest.

Forbes reports that Jenner is the 27th-richest self-made woman in the United States, beating out the rest of her famous family. (Her older sister Kim Kardashian West is estimated to be worth $350 million.)  According to Forbes, Jenner is on the cusp of becoming the youngest self-made billionaire in the world, a title Mark Zuckerberg earned at 23 years old.  Advertisement  Kylie Jenner may be the youngest sibling of the Kardashian/Jenner clan, but she is also the family member bringing in the most cash.  Jenner, who's on the cover of Forbes' August 2018 \"America's Women Billionaires\" issue, is worth roughly $900 million, according to the magazine.  According to Forbes' calculations, that makes her not only the Jenner or Kardashian with the highest net worth, but the 27th-richest self-made woman in the United States. For comparison, Forbes estimates that Jenner's older sister Kim Kardashian West is worth roughly $350 million.  Jenny Cheng/Business Insider  The 20-year-old's net worth has skyrocketed thanks to the success of Kylie Cosmetics. Forbes conservatively values the company at $800 million, with an estimated $330 million in sales last year. Jenner is both the face of the company and the sole owner.  Advertisement  Forbes' Natalie Robehmed detailed how Kylie Cosmetics has found success by harnessing Jenner's immense social-media following and slashing costs by outsourcing labor. There are only five full-time employees, with Jenner's mother, Kris Jenner, handling finances and public relations in exchange for a 10% management cut, the report says.  Kylie Cosmetics is dealing with slowing growth \u2014 Forbes reports that revenue grew just 7% last year, with lip-kit revenue dropping an estimated 35%.  However, the magazine says it would take more than a slow year of sales to stop Jenner from reaching billionaire status and making history.  \"Another year of growth will make her the youngest self-made billionaire ever, male or female, trumping Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23,\" Robehmed reported.",

They've done everything from posing in glamorous gowns on the stairs in 2010 to testing out a 3D version in 2011 and even a chaotic carnival in 2013.

The family opted to not release a card in 2016.  This year, the KKW Beauty entrepreneur took on the role of organizing the Christmas card shoot \u2014 which which was captured by photographer Eli Linnetz.  \"This year's Christmas card is shot really casually. We're kind of doing jeans and T-shirts vibe. Really cute. All the kids and so hard to put together,\" Kardashian \u2014 who is expecting a baby no. 3 (via surrogate) early next year \u2014 said in November during her appearance on The Late Late Show. \"It's women and children this year.\"  Meanwhile, it's shaping up to be a very merry Christmas for Dream \u2014 who will be celebrating the big day with mom Chyna and her brother King Cairo, 5.  \"We'll be spending it together at my house,\" Chyna \u2014 who shares King with ex Tyga \u2014 tells PEOPLE. \"King is really excited about Santa, decorating the Christmas tree and his gifts! So it's really exciting to get the house holiday ready. And Dream is fascinated with Santa and loves all of the lights. She's getting into it all.\"  The entrepreneur also revealed that Dream has started \"walking and running.\"  \"It's so much fun chasing her around!\" she says. \"And she's started to say words, so it's really fun seeing her personality come out.\"",

Quit reading now if you haven't yet made it through the second season.  Thanks to Kylie, some viewers caught a glimpse of a family photo from the series that featured Fred and Serena with a baby.

And one Twitter follower could even relate to the Kylie's love of the show, tweeting, \"Kylie fangirling over The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is me af.\"  Whether Kylie secretly meant anything by the photo or she was just excited to be at the premiere remains unclear, but as Noah Schnapp of Stranger Things recently demonstrated, sometimes, spoilers just happen.",

Yet, the close-knit clan has stubbornly refused to confirm this. Like most open secrets, it\u2019s become almost frustrating. More frustrating than those two friends in your circle that everyone knows are secretly dating but refuse to admit it. More frustrating than knowing someone is throwing you a surprise birthday party but not knowing the exact details. More frustrating even than when someone you know keeps saying they\u2019re staying out of politics, but occasionally makes vague Facebook status that makes you think they\u2019re a secret Trump supporter. Yes, more frustrating than even that.  In the process, though, the Kardashian-Jenners have turned the presumably inevitable announcement and their surrounding anticipation into events on their own. It\u2019s not even a question of \u201cif\u201d that\u2019s interesting anymore, but rather \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhen\u2026. no seriously when? We\u2019re all waiting. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world right now. We have better things to think about.\u201d  Well, at least one confirmation may be coming our way sometime sort of soon, if the latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians is any indication. The trailer begins with Kris Jenner (in that blonde wig) and her three eldest daughters sitting around a table and presumably all cosplaying as powerful female crime lords, as Kris proposes, \u201cLet\u2019s raise a glass to Kris f\u2014\u2014 Jenner.\u201d Then they run through matters of Rob\u2019s whole situation with Blac Chyna, Kendall\u2019s anxiety issues, and a tarantula before we get to someone murmuring the phrase, \u201cDid you guys hear what\u2019s on TMZ?\u201d Then Kourtney says, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of people like not saying anything.\u201d (Yeah, us too.) Eventually, though, we wind up at a party where there\u2019s tears of joy and everyone is hugging Khloe. It definitely seems like a pregnancy announcement situation.  So, perhaps that\u2019s how the Khlo\u00e9 konfirmation goes down, almost as we all should have expected it, during a super-hyped episode of the family\u2019s show.  That leaves the matter of Kylie, who, save for some iPhone-shot footage, is as conspicuously absent from the preview as the part of her body below her neck is from her Snapchats. Some fans have theories about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Kim is currently teasing the family\u2019s Christmas card shoot on Instagram in a sort of 25 day long digital advent calendar: Khlo\u00e9 made her first full appearance today, but Kylie has been missing. Might she and her baby bump appear on day 25? Or could she too be waiting to reveal her news on the show?  Here\u2019s another curious matter to consider when mulling the timing: the trailer in question is for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year. So we may make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either. What\u2019s another few weeks at this point? Then again, what\u2019s the point of calling the show Keeping Up With The Kardashians if we\u2019re all way ahead of it anyway?  Either way, the\u2019ve managed to keep attention on this mystery for far longer than they should have.

        "generated_text": "It seems like the Kardashian-Jenner family has managed to keep the public guessing about the pregnancies of Khloe and Kylie Kardashian for months. While most open secrets become frustrating, the anticipation surrounding these two pregnancies has been turned into a media event by the family themselves. The latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians seems to be teasing a pregnancy announcement, with Kris Jenner and her daughters cosplaying as powerful female crime lords. However, Kylie's absence from the preview, save for some iPhone-shot footage, has left fans speculating about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Some fans have even suggested that Kim Kardashian's surrogate is Kylie Jenner, which could explain why she hasn't shown off her baby bump.\n\nDespite the lack of official confirmation, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians Christmas card shoot has been a source of excitement for fans. The 25 Days of Christmas advent calendar has been revealing the family one day at a time, with Khloe making her first full appearance on day 25. However, Kylie has been missing from the whole month, leaving fans disappointed and speculating about the timing of her pregnancy announcement.\n\nThe trailer for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year, has only added to the mystery surrounding Kylie's pregnancy. It seems like the family is determined to keep attention on this mystery for as long as possible, and some fans are wondering if we will make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either pregnancy. As they say in the trailer, \"Let's raise a glass to Kris f\u2014\u2014 Jenner!\"",

On Monday, the mom-to-be and Good American founder trademarked a few different names for a presumed cosmetic collection, including \"KOKO Kollection by Khloe Kardashian\" and \"KOKO Kollection,\" TMZ reports. This comes on the (Yeezy plastic stiletto) heels of the news that her sister Kourtney recently filed documents for a cosmetics company called Kourt, so it looks like Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty isn't the only new beauty brand giving Kylie Cosmetics a run for its money.  Like her sisters, Khlo\u00e9 has always been outspoken about her love for the beauty game, especially when it comes to makeup. Recently, someone tried to makeup-shame the mogul by demanding she \"post a real pic [with] no makeup and normal angels,\" to which she responded, \"I don't take those lol.\"  Though this is the first indication that Khlo\u00e9 may be launching a line of her own, it's hardly the first time she's taken her passion for the perfect contour and turned it into a business venture: She was a part of the Kardashian Beauty licensing deal with Kim and Kourtney way back in the day and collaborated with Kylie Cosmetics on a limited-edition lip kit collection called The Koko Collection. (Foreshadowing, anyone?)  Khlo\u00e9's own go-to makeup routine is fairly simple, so it will be interesting to see if the aesthetic of her line maintains the same sort of ease of products that she values in her own routine. Her \"ride-or-die\" products include a concealer for spot treatment, a contour and highlight kit, some mascara, and a nude lip pencil that she doubles as a lipstick. It's unclear what exactly she plans to sell in her own makeup line, but according to TMZ, her application covers a \"broad range of makeup merch,\" so here's hoping she gives us all an easy way to replicate this Kardashian-approved routine at home.

The three generations of Kardashian women also starred in a heavily desaturated video that makes the cinematography of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" look downright vibrant. North, dressed in a ruffled shirt, skirt and oversized blazer, can be seen trailing her mom (sporting thigh-high Fendi logo boots, as one does on hikes) through tall grass, picking wildflowers and sitting in an open field with Granny Kris before retreating to the pool. It's all set to husband Kanye West's \"Love Lockdown.\"  On Instagram, Kardashian West wrote, \"These @fendi memories \u2728 I will always cherish shooting this campaign with my mom @krisjenner & daughter.\"",

The guessing game has exhausted us. Thankfully, according to several sources, we might get our wish via the Kardashian Christmas card (or Kardashian Kristmas Kard, as we like to call it).  We\u2019ve been sitting tight since September when news broke that both sisters are expecting their first babies. But months later, the rumors have yet to be confirmed or denied. Now that we\u2019ve crept into December, it\u2019s beginning to look a lot like the Kardashian\u2019s annual Christmas card may give the confirmation fans have been waiting for.

She announced that she would be sharing a section of the photo shoot each of the 25 days leading up to Christmas \u2014 kind of like a digital Kardashian jigsaw puzzle.  Is it crazy to think that day 24 or 25 might act as the pregnancy reveal? We think not.  A source told Us Weekly at the end of November that Khlo\u00e9 would be announcing her pregnancy with beau Tristan Thompson soon. And another source told Hollywood Life back in October that the sisters and their mother, Kris Jenner, were planning to announce the news during the holiday season. The source said:  \"The Kardashian Christmas card is something that is very important for Kris Jenner. Kris wants to take everyone\u2019s excitement and use this year\u2019s card to be the reveal of all the pregnancies in the family.\"  Okay, we\u2019re sold. This has to happen!

I mean really fluffy stuff \u2014 puppies learning how to walk, epic marriage proposals, and literally anything to do with babies. Fortunately, I have a celebrity family who truly understands my needs and is here to deliver. I'm talking about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West and their adorable little family, obvi! Every now and then, they take to social media to show us photos or videos of their growing family and, for that, I am eternally grateful. And now, the world is #blessed with a photo of Kanye West kissing Chicago, and it is exactly what I needed to elevate my mood today.  Kanye West has definitely been stirring the pot recently with... well, pretty much everything. But the one thing that has always remained constant is how much he clearly adores his children. And on Tuesday, Nov. 13, Kim Kardashian shared the sweetest photo of the \"Lift Yourself\" rapper giving their 9-month-old daughter, Chicago, a kiss on Instagram.  Captioning it with a simple happy face emoji, the photo shows Kardashian's rapper husband giving Chicago a kiss on the top of her tiny lil' head. Chicago, who's wearing a white tee (perhaps to match her dad) and a grey bib is giving her best \"stare off into the distance\" look, and to say that it's too pure for words is an understatement:  CAN YOU EVEN TAKE THE CUTENESS?  I can't choose which photo is cuter: Chicago and Kanye West having a precious moment together, or the photo that Kim Kardashian posted of her with her three children, North, Saint, and Chicago (or Chi, if you're trying to feel ~in the know~ with things).  Just a few days ago, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star posted the picture to Instagram, showing herself smizing with Chicago on her lap staring directly into the camera like the perfect little model. Saint is sitting (laying?) next to her giving the camera his very best profile, and North is sitting down on Kim's other side, looking like she has better things to be doing than posing for a picture. Kardashian aptly captioned the photo, \"North is always a mood \ud83d\ude02,\" and I've never heard a more accurate statement.  It was nice to see some sort of update with Kanye West, though, even if it wasn't regarding his new music. In case you missed it, West pushed back his Yandhi album release date once more, after initially delaying the Sept. 29 debut to Nov. 23. If you're looking to find when exactly his new album will be released, you're going to be pretty disappointed. West has yet to confirm when exactly Yandhi will drop, and on Monday, Nov. 12, he took to Twitter to open up to his fans about his new music.  After his performance with rapper Kid Cudi at Camp Flog Gnaw, West explained that he's holding off on debuting his new album because it's not quite ready yet.  He wrote,  It felt so good being on the stage last night with my brother Cudi. After performing again, I realize the new album I\u2019ve been working on isn\u2019t ready yet. I\u2019ll announce the release date once it\u2019s done. Thank you for understanding  Well, if I can't get new Kanye West music, I will absolutely settle for more Kanye West family photos, so keep 'em coming, Kim!",

He had to really work hard to get to where he is today, which is a major reason why he feels the way he does about spoiling Stormi.  \"He worked for everything he has and feels Kylie's parenting skills are over-the-top because she's had a silver spoon in her mouth since birth,\" the source said. \"He wants Kylie to have some perspective and stop spending so much on the baby before it's too late.\"  And to prove Travis' point even further that Kylie buys Stormi anything and everything, the new mom was just pictured holding her four-month-old in an $625 Gucci baby carrier at North West and Penelope Disick's unicorn-themed birthday party. The 20-year-old captioned the shot, \"Happy Birthday, North & P,\" but the only thing we noticed was the carrier because it was literally so extra.  All of this is no surprise, though, and it's not to say Kylie hasn't worked hard for the things she has either. But, maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 Travis wants his daughter to hopefully understand that everything won't always be handed to her. Stormi will have to ~werk~ for her perks some day, too!",
        "generated_text": "Kylie Jenner, the 20-year-old reality TV star and businesswoman, is valued at over $900 million, making her the youngest self-made billionaire ever, according to Forbes. This is thanks in part to her makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, which is worth $800 million and generates $60 million in after-tax dividends. In addition to her cosmetics company, Jenner has also made millions from sponsorship deals and her mobile-gaming app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.\n\nJenner's wealth has also been a source of controversy, with her baby daddy, Travis Scott, reportedly feeling that she is spoiling their daughter, Stormi, too much. According to a source, Scott is annoyed with the amount of money Jenner is spending on Stormi's designer clothing, strollers, and accessories, and he wants her to stop.\n\nScott, who was born in Houston, TX, and grew up in a middle-class town, values hard work and believes that Stormi should have to work for her perks, just like he did. He wants Jenner to have some perspective and stop spending so much on Stormi before it's too late.\n\nDespite this, Jenner has continued to spend money on her daughter, with pictures surfacing of her holding Stormi in a $625 Gucci baby carrier at a birthday party. While Jenner has worked hard for her success, Scott's perspective highlights the importance of teaching children the value of hard work and responsibility, even at a young age.",

Despite their official status as a family, the pair is usually apart in the spotlight: Where Jenner goes, Scott rarely follows. Jenner said it was a way for the two to preserve their relationship and Scott's comfort level.  \u201cI know he doesn't like the attention,\" she said. \"That's why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won't come.

I'm over here. Kylie is different.\u201d  To Jenner, the \u201ccurse\u201d extends past the Kardashian's love interests to anyone who hasn\u2019t fielded criticism the way the family has.  \u201cIt's everyone around us that aren't used to it.

Jenner explained that she knows he doesn't like the attention, which is why they go the extra mile to keep their relationship private.\n\nThe couple also discussed the \"Kardashian Curse,\" the phenomenon that surrounds the celebrity attention that follows the Kardashian name, making even the half-sister's best relationships unsuitable for the spotlight. Jenner agreed that this curse extends beyond their love interests to anyone who hasn't faced similar criticism.\n\nJenner is a leading force in the makeup industry, selling more than $630 million in products in three years, while Scott is a rapper best known for his 2015 album Rodeo and 2017 single Butterfly Effect. Despite their busy schedules, the couple still finds time to celebrate special occasions, like Kourtney Kardashian's 39th birthday party, where Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were seen being super adorable and making out.\n\nIn related news, Kris Jenner was also at the party, showing that she is still a lively gem at heart. Jenner and her daughter Kim have been known to have a close relationship, and their \"passionate moment\" at Kanye West's lap has been captured and shared on Instagram Stories.\n\nOverall, Jenner and Scott's decision to keep their relationship private is a smart move that allows them to focus on their family and careers without the constant scrutiny of the media. While the Kardashian Curse may pose a challenge to their relationships, the couple seems to be handling it well and enjoying their time together.",

As Kim and Kanye shared their first photo as a family of five on Instagram on March 4, the couple were inundated with questions as to why they looked so unhappy, despite their gorgeous children in high spirits alongside them.  While North held a peace sign at the camera, the rest of her relatives wore blank expressions, something rapper Kanye is known for.  \"Is Kanye ok?\" one person replied, while a second commented: \"Look at his face\".  (Image: Kim Kardashian/Instagram)  Meanwhile a third added: \"It alright to smile...your kids are going to want to see pictures of you guys smiling. You all look miserable!\"  \"A smile from a happy parent won\u2019t hurt,\" replied a fourth.  So why do the Kardashian-Wests rarely smile?  Kanye answered the question in 2015, drawing his inspiration from \"paintings in an old castle\".

(Image: Twitter / RodeoTheAlbum)  The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she received criticism in the press over her pregnant appearance, while she was battling preeclampsia which caused her to bloat.

        "doc_1_text": "In a video released by GQ on Tuesday, Kylie Jenner quizzed her boyfriend, Travis Scott, with several questions about herself. One of the questions she asked was \"What nickname do we call Stormi?\" In case you don't keep up with the Kardashians, Stormi is Jenner and Scott's infant daughter. Kylie also asked, \"What's one of the nicknames I call you?\" So, what are Kylie Jenner's nicknames for Stormi and Travis Scott? They're actually pretty cute.  In a joint video interview for GQ, Kylie quizzed Scott on everything from her family, to how many tattoos she has, to her favorite color, and more. It was basically an adorable test of how well the rapper knows his makeup empire businesswoman girlfriend, and to his credit, he got 20 out of 23 questions correct in the end.  Specifically, Kylie asked Scott what they call their 5-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster, as a nickname. And apparently, the famous couple has more than one nickname for the baby girl. Scott and Kylie both came up with Storm Storm, Burrito, and Peanut, as Us Weekly reported. Nothing out of the ordinary as a nickname for a little girl named Stormi, but adorable nonetheless.  Not about to leave the rapper out of the nickname reveal fun, in the video below, Kylie also asked Scott, \"What's one of the nicknames I call you?\"  Scott initially struggled with the answer, and Kylie admitted, \"I don't really call you any nicknames.\" \"Yea,\" Scott replied, \"You just call me baby.\"  However, Scott then added that Kylie calls him \"Daddy\" sometimes, with a quick smirk at the camera. Kylie laughed it off, but she didn't deny the nickname.  Initially, some fans thought Stormi actually was a nickname, and maybe short for something else. But the official name listed on the baby's birth certificate is Stormi Webster, according to ELLE. Her surname is the same as her father's \u2014 Scott's real name is actually Jacques Bermon Webster II.  In an Instagram post back in April, Kylie called her daughter \"angel baby,\" but that doesn't mean it's a usual nickname she uses for her baby girl. If there are other nicknames Kylie and Scott use for Stormi besides Storm Storm, Burrito, or Peanut, they haven't shared them with the public.  Interestingly enough, Kylie's sister, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian also calls her daughter True Thompson \"Peanut,\" according to E! News. The truth is, it's really not that uncommon a nickname for a baby (I personally have several mom friends who use it for their kids, boy or girl).  Kylie's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, has three kids: Mason, Penelope, and Reign. But we don't know if any of their nicknames are Peanut as well. Same with her sister Kim Kardashian West's children, North, Saint, and Chicago. Brother Rob Kardashian has just one little girl, Dream, and sister Kendall Jenner doesn't have any kids who could have a nickname like Peanut in the first place.  In the GQ interview, Kylie and Scott covered a lot of other topics besides nicknames as well. Scott, for instance, didn\u2019t remember the names of three of Kylie's dogs when he was asked, according to Cosmopolitan. Oops.  But he did know the location of Jenner\u2019s biggest scar \u2014 her left leg. Scott also knew how long it takes Kylie to do her makeup (two hours) and her favorite color (black), according to Us Weekly. He also remembered her biggest craving while she was pregnant, which was In-N-Out Burger.  But in a longer profile of Kylie and Scott for GQ, Kylie revealed that Scott actually doesn't like the attention that her whole family seems to attract, so there's probably a lot of things about them and their relationship he's just chosen not to reveal to the public. That might just include more nicknames that Kylie has for their daughter, or for Travis Scott himself.",

One of the questions she asked was \"What nickname do we call Stormi?\" to which Scott responded with \"Storm Storm, Burrito, and Peanut.\" While Stormi is a fairly common nickname for a baby girl named Stormi, it seems that Scott and Kylie have more than one nickname for their baby girl.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian also calls her daughter True Thompson \"Peanut,\" which may suggest that the nickname is used in the Kardashian-Jenner family. However, it's not clear if Kylie and Scott have any other nicknames for Stormi or for each other.\n\nOverall, it seems that Kylie and Travis Scott have a pretty cute and unique relationship, and their love for each other is evident in the questions and answers they shared in their GQ interview. While the nickname battle between Kylie and Kim may not be over yet, it's clear that these sisters have a close and supportive relationship.",

The reality star took to Twitter on Tuesday to dispel several reports that she is pregnant, based on an interview she gave to Grazia magazine.  \"The interviewer asked me 'What\u2019s a crazy rumor that you\u2019ve heard about yourself?' and my answer was...'I\u2019ve heard that I am pregnant,'\" the 38-year-old mom of three tweeted. \"I see online that I said I was pregnant in an interview, but that was completely taken out of context.\"  If Kourtney was pregnant, the Kardashian-Jenner Rugrats-style playpen (that surely exists) would about to get pretty crowded, as four of the five sisters -- eighty percent -- would be expecting a child.

        "generated_text": "In a world filled with fear and uncertainty, the lyrics of \"Scared\" by Chris Brown and several other artists paint a picture of a life consumed by the desire to experience the thrills and pleasures that come with living on the edge. From smoking weed and doing WiFi to riding through the night and living the high life, these lyrics capture the essence of a generation that is eager to embrace the unknown and push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.\n\nHowever, as the Big Oxmox reminds us, there are consequences to living such a life. \"Scared\" is a reminder that there is a price to be paid for the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of the unknown. It is a warning to those who are afraid of their own heartbeats, to be cautious and mindful of the risks they are taking.\n\nDespite this warning, the desire to live life on the edge remains strong. From the Italic Mountains to the valleys teeming with vapour, from the little world among the stalks to the vast language ocean, there is a sense of serenity and beauty that draws us in and fills us with a sense of wonder and awe.\n\nIn this world of blind texts, where the languages of Vokalia and Consonantia are separated and live in their own Bookmarksgrove, there is a sense of freedom and possibility that is hard to ignore. The possibilities are endless, and the rewards are great. All we have to do is embrace the unknown and live life to the fullest.\n\nBut as Gregor Samsa discovered, living such a life is not always easy. It requires\u52c7\u6c14, strength, and a willingness to take risks. It also requires a deep understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.\n\nIn the end, the choice is ours. Will we choose to live a life of fear and uncertainty, or will we choose to embrace the unknown and live life to the fullest? The lyrics of \"Scared\" remind us that it is up to us to decide.",

There have been other properties in other places\u2014including a ch\u00e2teau in France and homes in New Orleans and New York City\u2014but this has always been his kids' \u201cchildhood home,\u201d he says. And even though they're not here now, he's decided it's important that he is. Today the place is deeply silent, except for the snoring of his bulldog, Jacques.  Pitt wears a flannel shirt and skinny jeans that hang loose on his frame. Invisible to the eye is that sculpted bulk we've seen on film for a quarter-century. He looks like an L.A. dad on a juice cleanse, gearing up to do house projects. On the counter sit some plated goodies from Starbucks, which he doesn't touch, and some coffee, which he does. Pitt, who exudes likability, general decency, and a sense of humor (dark and a little cockeyed), says he's really gotten into making matcha lately, something a friend introduced him to. He loves the whole ritual of it. He deliberately sprinkles some green powder in a cup with a sifter, then pours in the boiling water, whisking with a bamboo brush, until the liquid is a harlequin froth. \u201cYou're gonna love this,\u201d he says, handing me the cup.  Get the summer issue of GQ Style on newsstands soon, or subscribe here.  Serenity, balance, order: That's the vibe, at least. That's what you think you're feeling in the kitchen of Brad Pitt's perfectly constructed, awesomely decorated abode. Outside, children's bikes are lined up in the rack; a blown-up dragon floatie bobs on the pool through the window.

In conversation, he seems absolutely locked in one moment and a little twitchy and forlorn in the next, having been put on a journey he didn't intend to make but admits was \u201cself-inflicted.\u201d The unfortunate worst of it surfaced in public this past September. When he was on a flight to Los Angeles aboard a private plane, there was a reported altercation between Pitt and one of his six children, 15-year-old Maddox. An anonymous phone call was made to the authorities, which triggered an FBI investigation (ultimately closed with no charges). Five days later, his wife, Angelina Jolie, filed for divorce. By then, everything in Pitt's world was in free fall. It wasn't just a public-relations crisis\u2014there was a father suddenly deprived of his kids, a husband without wife. And here he is, alone, a 53-year-old human father/former husband smack in the middle of an unraveled life, figuring out how to mend it back together.",
        "generated_text": "Brad Pitt, the 53-year-old actor and former husband of Angelina Jolie, has returned to his childhood home in Hollywood Hills, California, where he has lived since 1994. The actor, who is currently single, was spotted making matcha green tea in his Craftsman-style home, looking like an LA dad on a juice cleanse. He deliberately sprinkles some green powder in a cup with a sifter, then pours in the boiling water, whisking with a bamboo brush, until the liquid is a harlequin froth.\n\nPitt's home, which has been deeply silent except for the snoring of his bulldog Jacques, exudes a sense of serenity and balance. The house is awesomely decorated, with exquisite inlay on the sideboard and a vase on the mantel. From the outside, children's bikes are lined up in the rack, and a blown-up dragon floatie bobs on the pool through the window.\n\nDespite the chaos that has surrounded Pitt in the past few months, he seems to be handling it well. He acknowledges that it has been a \"weird\" time, but is determined to keep his family together. He has been spending time with his children, Maddox and Pax, and has been working on his acting career.\n\nPitt's house carries its own stories, not just about when the Jolie-Pitts were a happy family, but also from back in the day, when Jimi Hendrix crashed here. It is said that he wrote \"May This Be Love\" out in the grotto, with its waterfall.\n\nOutside, children's bikes are lined up in the rack; a blown-up dragon floatie bobs on the pool through the window.

Whether he can mend his relationship with Jolie and regain his role as a father to their six children remains to be seen, but for now, he seems to be focusing on taking things one day at a time.",

However, he also deals with the pressures of being in Chris Brown's body, as well as the controversy that comes with it.\n\nDespite the challenges, Lil Dicky enjoys his time in Chris Brown's body and even appreciates his soft dick. He even gets to experience the luxury of being in Chris Brown's body, such as being able to get into clubs and even being mistaken for Chris Brown on the street.\n\nIn the end, Lil Dicky decides to switch back to his own body, but not before experiencing what it's like to be Chris Brown. The song ends with him saying, \"I can't believe that it's Freaky Friday\" and then switching to Ed Sheeran's body. While being in Sheeran's body is less cool than being Chris Brown, it still provides a unique perspective on life and the world around us.",

It's just so redundant!Anyways, when they finally meet in the light of day (this is better explained inwe discover that Cabe \"Haw\" Delgade, yes that is his name, is a domineering, bossy, infurtiating Alpha Male, by the end of the book we discover he's the way he is because his wife and daughter died in a tragic accident and he lost his marbles and became over protective, fine, I understand but that does NOT justify the following behaviour:1. He thinks the best solution to deal with Gwen is to manhandle her. Examples:Gwen: This relationship is overHawk: *pushes her up against the wall and holds her jaw in place* It's over when I say it isGwen: *having a bitch fit because someone just shot at her*Hawk: *pushes her up against the wall and holds her jaw in place* calm down.Gwen: Get out of my house I dont want to see you anymoreHawk: *hauls her to bed,hugs her to him, locks her with his legs* Go to sleep Gwen.Why. Why?! I don't agree with characters like this, I strongly don't agree with horny female characters either. The only reason she stays with him is because when he manhandles her, ALTHOUGH SHE SAYS SHE'S ANGRY, she ends up kissing him.How can a guy push you around like that, and then just kiss you and make it all better?! You see? Slut.2. All the time they have been having an affair and she did not know his name, he had his \"commandos\" following her around, he knows what time she eats, what time she sleeps, who she hangs out with, her parents history, EVERYTHING. He's also got security cameras everywhere in her house. Stalker? No! According to Gwen, this means he cares! Aww.In addition to all this sillines, Gwen is also attracted to 2 OTHER guys. She harps on and on about how she loves Hawk, then somehow ends up kissing the other 2. Oopthiee! Fuck off.Plot FailureI don't understand the side plot myself. Gwen's step sister is a crack whore who stole money from some dangerous people, but she also owes this biker gang (which is headed by one of Gwen's love interests) money and then there is her best friend, another crack whore, Darla, who wants to kill her.I STILL dont know what Hawk does, but he has money to drive a camaro, he install security systems, he has \"commandos\", his office is a high tech CSI Miami scene, he has guns, he managed to beat up 3 guys while he was tied up from his ankles.So we have one biker leader, one mystery alpha dominant male and one detective whose trying to solve the case all with the hots for Gwen.So basically, as a summaryEveryone likes Gwen, Gwen likes Hawk, and everyone elses's kisses, Hawk's wife died, Gwen's sister is a crack whore, Lawson (the detective), Hawk and Tank(the biker), spend their time trying to protect Gwen and make her love them, a bunch of kidnappings occur, and finally, obviously, Gwen and Hawk hook up, and EVERYONE IN THE BOOK STAYS FRIENDS FOREVER!Grammar NaziEveryone called each other \"babe\" :Hawk to Gwen. Gwen to Hawk, Gwen to her friends, her friends to each other, Gwen to lawson , lawson to Gwen, Gwens mom to Gwen, Gwen to her crack whore sister. Which amounted to Babe/Baby being repeated!!! As if that wasn't bad enough, the author felt the need to be creative and bombarded us with:Honey - 45 timesSweet Pea- 70 timesPeaches- 19 timesFor some reason all the characters had the grammar and vocabulary skills of a Gangster who dropped out of school in the 5th grade, while Gwen graced us with the \"word\" \"Um\" 71 times.SEVENTY ONE TIMES.Nough Said.You know why I got angry? Because I LOVE mindless chick flicks, and I was willing to forgo so maanny of the above, in fact, the first few chapters had me ROLLING ON THE GROUND with laughter. Then BAM , slamming to walls and manhandling occurs, and that is just not my peice of cake.All I can say is:This is your fault Christian Grey.",

        "generated_text": "In a world of endless possibilities, language plays a crucial role in shaping our experiences and interactions with others. From the simplest phrases to the most complex conversations, language is what connects us to the world around us. But what happens when multiple languages come together to form a new, common language? According to experts, this new language would be more simple and regular than the existing European languages, with a focus on clarity and ease of communication.\n\nIn the world of blind texts, where language is often used to convey meaning without using actual words, this new common language could bring about a sense of unity and understanding. Imagine being able to understand and communicate with someone who speaks a language you've never heard before \u2013 it's a powerful feeling that can bring people together in a way that nothing else can.\n\nBut while the idea of a common language is intriguing, it's important to remember that language is more than just a collection of words and phrases. It's a reflection of our culture, our history, and our values. Changing the way we speak could have far-reaching consequences, both positive and negative. So, before we rush headfirst into the idea of a new common language, we must consider the implications and the impact it could have on our society.\n\nUltimately, language is a powerful tool that can bring people together or tear them apart.

As our guide talks quietly about how an elephant\u2019s ear resembles the shape of Africa, they begin to stroll our way. The herd is making its way to the road and coming straight towards the vehicle. It\u2019s an uncomfortable mixture of excitement and terror. As we look at them, they stare back.

        "doc_2_text": "Thus Mill\u2019s case for the claim that happiness is the sole human end, put more carefully, is this: \u2018Whatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is desired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself until has become so\u2019 (1861a: 237). Nothing here assumed Hume\u2019s view that every action must ultimately flow from an underived desire. That is a quite separate issue, and Mill\u2019s view of it is closer to that of Kant or Reid than to that of Hume. He insists \u2018positively and emphatically\u2019 that the will is a different thing from desire; that a person of confirmed virtue, or any other person whose purposes are fixed, carries out his purposes without any thought of the pleasure he has in contemplating them, or expects to derive from their fulfilment. (1861a: 238) This distinction between purpose and desire is central to Mill\u2019s conception of the will. When we develop purposes we can will against mere likings or aversions: \u2018In the case of an habitual purpose, instead of willing the thing because we desire it, we often desire it only because we will it\u2019 (1861a: 238). Every action is caused by a motive, but not every motive is a liking or aversion: When the will is said to be determined by motives, a motive does not mean always, or solely, the anticipation of a pleasure or of a pain\u2026. A habit of willing is commonly called a purpose; and among the causes of our volitions, and of the actions which flow from them, must be reckoned not only likings and aversions, but also purposes. (1843: 842) The formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of will; it is also the development of character. Mill quotes Novalis: \u2018a character is a completely fashioned will\u2019 (1843: 843).",
        "generated_text": "In his work, John Stuart Mill presents a strong argument that happiness is the ultimate goal of human existence. According to him, all actions are ultimately directed towards achieving happiness, and anything that is not done for this purpose is not truly desired. Mill distinguishes between desire and purpose, stating that a person of virtue or with fixed aims carries out their actions without necessarily thinking of the pleasure they will derive from them.\n\nMill's view of the will is also central to his conception of the human character. He argues that the formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of will, and that this process is also the development of character. Mill quotes Novalis, stating that \"a character is a completely fashioned will.\"\n\nIn a parallel passage, the blind texts of Lorem Ipsum and their journey to the World of Grammar are described. The passage describes a serene and paradisematic country, where the blind texts live and create. However, one day, Lorem Ipsum decides to leave this paradise and explore the World of Grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, Mill's argument that happiness is the ultimate goal of human existence is closely tied to his view of the will and character. He distinguishes between desire and purpose, and argues that the formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of will and the development of character. The parallel passage of blind texts also highlights the idea of exploring new possibilities and seeking knowledge.",

        "doc_2_text": "Miranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand. Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn\u2019t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. \u201cStill, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,\u201d Kerr recently reflected. \u201cEver since, I\u2019ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.\u201d  For seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington, New Zealand\u2019s capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom, was filming \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d Peter Jackson\u2019s two-part prequel to the epic \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington \u2014 or \u201cWellywood,\u201d as it\u2019s been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar \u2014 is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London, 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles, 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo. Of the city\u2019s many charms \u2014 its burgeoning restaurant scene, its absurdly picturesque scenery, the mellow Kiwi hospitality you experience everywhere you go \u2014 it is Wellington\u2019s physical isolation that makes it such a singular place. During the week I spent in the city, no matter what I was doing, even something as simple as sitting at a cafe sipping a flat white (New Zealand\u2019s richer version of a latte), I felt a palpable remove from the ways and rhythms of the rest of the world. (Being on the other side of the international date line helps.) So while much of Wellington could be compared to, say, Portland, Ore., or Seattle, there is the added seduction of being pleasantly unmoored, able to take in the pleasure of civilization while existing outside of it.  The circumstances of Kerr\u2019s stay in Wellington were, of course, quite different from her initial visit. She is now the mother of a cherubic young son, Flynn, 19 months, and the tent of her teen years was replaced by an airy, seaside mansion where every window looks out on Wellington Harbour. (The house, lent to the couple by one of the film\u2019s producers, happens to be where Bloom celebrated his 22nd birthday while filming \u201cTLOTR.\u201d) If she wanted to run an errand, or head to an afternoon Pilates class, a production assistant gave her a ride. Sweet perks, no question. And yet, to hear Kerr tell it, the life she and Bloom carved out in Wellington was in many ways a reminder of what existence was like before she became a celebrity, a kind of geographic escape hatch from the scrutiny of tabloids and the curious eyes of strangers. When they first arrived, for instance, they took a road trip that was reminiscent of her earlier journey: aimlessly driving around the countryside, out of reach and out of touch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t camp because Flynn\u2019s still a little young for that,\u201d Kerr told me. \u201cBut it was just the three of us, nothing to do except be with each other in this shockingly beautiful place.\u201d  Kerr and I were having this conversation at Wellington\u2019s Botanic Garden, a sprawling expanse of lush floral curiosities, manicured lawns and shaded labyrinthine walkways offering some of the most extraordinary views of the city. It was hard to imagine that this was the same woman who, a few months earlier, had walked the runway in a $2.5 million bra while Maroon 5 performed at the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show; here, in raw-denim jeans and a loose navy sweater, she seemed no different from the other health-conscious young mothers who made up most of the gardens\u2019 visitors. Kerr had come from the set of \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d which she visited most days with Flynn when Bloom, who was reprising his role as the bow-wielding elf Legolas, was working. \u201cThere\u2019s a cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and they\u2019re all in full makeup,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo you see these poor Orcs\u201d \u2014 the demonic goblin soldiers of the film \u2014 \u201ctrying to eat without ruining their costumes. For Orlando, it\u2019s easier. He just has the blond wig and the pointy ears.\u201d",

There\u2019s nothing I can do, nothing any of us can do now, except wait for what\u2019s coming. Charlotte Phelan speaking with Skeeter (Pg 372)  \u201cGo shopping\u2026get some new clothes.

(Pg 430)  \u201cWho taught you those things, Mae Mobley?\u201d Mister Leefolt say and Baby Girl whip her head around with eyes like she seed a ghost. Aibileen watching Raleigh Leefolt speak to Mae Mobley (Pg 431)  My mouth drop open.

        "doc_2_text": "On the day in late February when I arrive at Georgina Chapman\u2019s town house in the West Village to interview her, it\u2019s unseasonably hot, nearly 80 degrees. I am ushered to the parlor floor, where, even though it feels like August outside, a fire is roaring away. As I wait, it suddenly dawns on me that I am sitting in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s living room. He purchased the six-story house in 2006, the year before he married Chapman, and she has since put her stamp all over it: black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, lots of gilt and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, a Jo Malone candle burning. On a console table are silver-framed photographs from happier times, mostly of the couple\u2019s children: India and Dashiell, seven and five. All evidence of the original occupant would appear to have been scrubbed away\u2014except for a large piece of art hanging in the hallway. At the bottom, it is signed, \u201cFor Harvey Weinstein.\u201d The drawing is dominated by a large empty circle, next to which it reads, \u201cThe moon was here.\u201d  I had been introduced to Chapman, dressed in a floor-length dark print dress, a couple of weeks earlier at the West Twenty-sixth Street atelier of the fashion company, Marchesa, that she co-owns with Keren Craig. That day, she struck me as hyperalert: flitting around, wide-eyed and nervous, uncomfortable in her skin\u2014or lack thereof, as it were. She mentioned, almost in passing, that she hadn\u2019t been out in public in five months\u2014not since the news broke in October of so many unbearably similar accusations by so many women of harassment, abuse, and rape perpetrated by her husband. When she appears today, dressed in jeans, a white T-shirt, ballerina flats, and an armful of gold bracelets, she is more relaxed, though there\u2019s a gallows humor\u2014a morbidity\u2014firmly in place. When I mention the disturbingly warm weather, she laughs and says, \u201cThink of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\u201d  We head downstairs to the ground floor, where most of the living takes place: a big, casual, open space with lots of color, modern furniture, and surprising art. There\u2019s a huge, elegant kitchen that looks out onto a backyard, and a TV room where Dash, on spring break, is sitting on a sectional, ensorcelled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looks younger. Or is it that she seems younger? In photographs, she has often reminded me of Victoria Beckham\u2014chiseled and somewhat brittle-looking. But, today, dressed so California-casual, her hair now long and blonde, with wide-set blue eyes and fine features, she looks more like a younger Michelle Pfeiffer. Though she is English to her core, using whilst and learnt in a thick, posh accent, she is more goofy than I had imagined. As we sit down to lunch\u2014a simple spread of veal Milanese and eggplant parmigiana\u2014she seems a bit flustered, unable to maintain a hostess facade for too long, or even to decide where I should sit.  Our meeting, in her soon-to-be ex\u2013town house that her soon-to-be ex-husband recently sold, was meant to be the moment when Chapman would finally, publicly address for the first time what happened. The night before, she had called me fairly late, and I thought she was going to back out. She sounded worried, apologizing profusely, talking fast. She was not ready to address anything too difficult, did not feel prepared. I reassured her that we could talk about her life before Harvey or about Marchesa\u2014which is exactly what we did at first.",
        "generated_text": "On a late February day, I visited Georgina Chapman\u2019s townhouse in the West Village. It was unseasonably hot, with temperatures nearing 80 degrees. Despite the warm weather, a fire was burning in the parlor floor, providing a cozy atmosphere. As I waited, I realized that I was sitting in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s living room. He had purchased the six-story house in 2006, the year before he married Chapman, and she had since transformed it with her unique style. The house featured black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, gilt, and glass, along with hydrangeas in a vase and a Jo Malone candle burning.\n\nChapman, who was dressed in a floor-length dark print dress, appeared nervous and uncomfortable in her skin. She mentioned that she hadn\u2019t been out in public for five months since the news broke about her husband\u2019s harassment allegations. Today, she was more relaxed, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt, ballerina flats, and armfuls of gold bracelets. Despite her British accent, she exhibited a goofy side that surprised me.\n\nOur meeting took place in her soon-to-be ex-town house that her soon-to-be ex-husband recently sold. It was meant to be the first time she would publicly address the allegations. However, she initially sounded hesitant, apologetic, and unsure about the interview.\n\nDuring our conversation, we discussed her life before Weinstein and her fashion company, Marchesa, which she co-owns with Keren Craig. Although she appeared a bit flustered and unable to maintain a hostess facade for long, she eventually warmed up to me.\n\nThe meeting was also an opportunity for her to reflect on the past and move forward. As she put it, \u201cThink of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\u201d Despite the challenges, she remained optimistic and hopeful for the future.\n\nAs we left the house, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the similarities between Chapman and the characters from The Help, a book that she had mentioned in our conversation. The book, set in Jackson, Mississippi, explores the lives of African American maids and the white women who employ them. The quotes from the book showcase the racial discrimination and inequality that the characters faced, as well as their strength and resilience in the face of adversity.",

As fans may remember, Paula Abdul struggled with an eating disorder years ago, and she thankfully managed to recover her health.

She has worked so hard to get back into shape. Paula is using muscles she has not exercised in years as part of her grueling stage show, and that is probably the cause of her injury.

I won\u2019t blame you.  Still, the picture \u2014 it was all over the news \u2014 stops me. There she is, this pop princess, newly bald, dressed unglamorously in shorts and sweatshirt, rearing back with an umbrella, ready to give that car what it has coming. Supposedly, the vehicle belongs to a photographer who had been tailing her.  In that photo, there is something of the spoiled child lashing out. Something of the little girl, broken. Something of the baby crying for help.  ADVERTISEMENT  As I said, I can\u2019t blame you if you laugh. Blaming you would be hypocritical.  Britney Spears doesn\u2019t get a lot of air time in my internal monologue. I don\u2019t listen to her music or watch her videos. She\u2019s a presence at the edge of consciousness, more famous for being pretty and showing skin and sowing scandal than for any intrinsic quality of her singing. Suffice it to say, Gladys Knight\u2019s legacy is safe from her encroachment. Barbra Streisand does not suffer in the comparison.  To the degree I think about her at all, it\u2019s usually as a laugh line. People ask if I miss being a pop music critic, having spent the first 18 years of my professional life in that capacity. I tell them I give thanks every morning that I don\u2019t have to pretend to take Britney Spears seriously. It\u2019s always good for a chuckle.  That\u2019s what Spears was to me: a punchline.  Am I the only one? Or isn\u2019t it true that between her two-day first marriage, her Madonna kiss on national television, her panties-optional dress code, she long ago became, even for her fans, a person whose attraction lay less in her modest talents than in the sense you never knew what she might do next? She was a little crazy. A little out of control. A little clueless in ways that made you feel better about the garbage of your own life.  As in, maybe I ain\u2019t no Nobel Prize winner, but at least I have sense enough to wear underwear when I go out.  And you could say this, talk about her like she wasn\u2019t in the room, because she was not, in some sense, real. Spears was an abstract, an idea. Not a troubled young woman who has been in and out of rehab in recent days, a woman for whom fame and fortune have apparently proven inadequate to fill the emptiness inside.  The abstraction is not surprising: whatever media touch, they objectify. Some years ago, I got an e-mail from an outraged reader who, as the saying goes, called me everything but a child of God. I e-mailed him back and we ended up having a perfectly civil exchange. I remember he seemed embarrassed, as if he had not quite realized that the byline represented an actual human being who might actually read his invective. He had hurled it at an idea of me.  ADVERTISEMENT  But I am not an idea.  If that can be forgotten about someone whose claim to fame is just that he scribbles in newspapers, how much more easily is it forgotten about those who live in the klieg lights of real fame? What must it be like to have your marriage and divorce, your relationship with your parents and kids, your sagging backside and ballooning thighs, dissected by millions of strangers who think they know you? Does money make that OK? Do luxury and fame?  I wouldn\u2019t think so. Life is not a show. But if we ever knew that, we forgot it in our rush to a day of \"reality\" television, tabloid journalism and famous for nothing celebrities. There is no reverence, no privacy, nothing held back as sacred. We ooh and ahh and laugh and point at the garbage of other lives, and forget that even the most famous person is still a person, not an idea.  Britney Jean Spears is not an idea. She\u2019s a 25-year-old mother of two who is coming apart at the seams. In public.  Go ahead and laugh if you want.  Leonard Pitts Jr. is a columnist for the Miami Herald. His e-mail address is lpitts@miamiherald.com.",

        "doc_1_text": "The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, ancient Greek for \"river horse\" (\u0399\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), is a large mammal from Africa that usually eats plants. It is one of only two species in the family Hippopotamidae that are still alive. The other is the pygmy hippopotamus.  The hippopotamus is the second largest land animal in size and the third largest land animal in weight. The elephant is the heaviest and the white rhinoceros is the second heaviest, but a bit smaller than the hippo. The hippo is also the heaviest artiodactyl.  The hippopotamus is semi-aquatic. This means that even though it usually lives on the land, it spends a great amount of time in rivers and lakes where males lead groups of 5 to 30 females and young. In the daytime, they keep cool by staying in the water or mud. They give birth to baby hippos in the water, too. At dusk, they come out to graze on grass. Hippopotamuses rest together in the water, but they like to graze by themselves.  The hippopotamus has: a torso that is shaped like a barrel, a very big mouth and teeth, an almost hairless body, short legs and great size. It is the third largest land mammal, judging by its weight, which is between between 1\u00bd and 3 tonnes. The white rhinoceros weighs 1\u00bd to 3\u00bd tonnes and the three species of elephant weigh 3 to 9 tonnes. Even though it has short, fat legs, it can run more quickly than a human. Some hippos have run at 30 km/h (19 mph) for short distances. The hippopotamus is one of the fiercest animals in the world. It is often called one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. There are about 125,000 to 150,000 hippos in Sub-Saharan Africa. Zambia (about 40,000) and Tanzania (20,000\u201330,000) have the most hippos. They are threatened because they are losing their habitats and being poached for their meat and ivory teeth.  The word \"hippopotamus\" comes from the ancient Greek \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, hippopotamos, from \u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, hippos, \"horse\" and \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, potamos, which means \"river\". So, \"hippopotamus\" means \"horse of the river\".[3] More than one hippopotamus are called hippopotami, and 'hippopotamuses' or 'hippos' is also used.[4] Hippopotami are social. About 30 hippos live together in groups. A male hippopotamus is known as a bull. A female hippopotamus is called a cow and a baby hippo is called a calf. The species is also known as the common hippopotamus or the Nile hippopotamus.  A hippo at the zoo in Lisbon  A drawing of a hippopotamus skeleton  Inside the mouth of a hippopotamus  Hippopotami are the fourth largest mammals in the world (after whales, elephants and rhinoceroses). The Egyptian hippopotamus is smaller than the others. They can live in the water or on land. They can walk or even run along the bottom of a river.  Because hippos are so large, it is difficult to weigh them in the wild. Most adult male hippos weigh between 1,500\u20131,800 kg (3,300\u20134,000 lb). Females hippos are smaller and usually weigh between 1,300\u20131,500 kg (2,900\u20133,300 lb). Older males can get even bigger. They are at least 3,200 kg (7,100 lb) and sometimes even weigh 4,500 kg (9,900 lb).[5][6]  Male hippos seem to keep on growing for their whole lives. Females hippos, though, become the heaviest when they are about 25 years old.[7]  Hippos have big and heavy bodies, dark gray skin and short legs. A hippo's main defence is their extremely strong mouth. They can grow to be 15 feet long and weigh 3,000 pounds.[8]  Hippopotami are herbivores which live in groups. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom.[9] They usually stay in the mud and water during the day and come out to eat grass or leaves at night. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotami can gallop at 30 km/h (19 mph) on land but normally trot.[9]  Many hippos lived in North Africa and Europe[10] until about 30,000 years ago. They used to be common in Egypt's Nile region from long ago, though they are not there now. Pliny the Elder writes that, in his time, the best place in Egypt for finding this animal was in Sais.[11] The animal could still be found around there after the Arab Conquest in 639. Hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of: Uganda, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia, west through Ghana to Gambia and also in Southern Africa (Botswana, Republic of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia). Some hippos also live in Tanzania and Mozambique. They like to live in places with water that is not too deep.  Hippos and humans [ change | change source ]  Lounging at the London Zoo in 1852  Hippos are very aggressive towards humans, whom they commonly attack whether in boats or on land with no apparent provocation. This aggression by the hippopotamus is caused by humans coming too close to their children. Hippopotami are very protective of their young and they often fear that humans pose a large threat to their young.[12] They are widely considered to be one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa.[13][14]  The earliest proof that humans were involved with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation from around 160,000 years ago.[15] Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted. They have been found in the mountains of the central Sahara from 4,000 to 5,000 years ago near Djanet. Ancient Egyptians also knew much about hippos. They knew the hippo was a fierce, wild animal that lived in the Nile. In Egyptian mythology, Tawaret, a goddess of protection in pregnancy and childbirth, had the head of a hippo. This was because ancient Egyptians saw how protective female hippopotami could be about their young.[16]",

Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say \u201cI do\u201d in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year\u2019s Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.  But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell\u2019s nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.  Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.  \u201cWe were always going to get married,\u201d Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. \u201cObviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn\u2019t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.\u201d  Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher\u2019s season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules\u2018 season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.  Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise \u2014 and they now have their first child on the way.  When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. \u201cWe were sort of in that wedding glow,\u201d Bass explains. \u201cIt felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day.

On Wednesday afternoon, the reality TV star confirmed in a statement obtained by ABC News that she was a part of the incident, which prompted Warner Brothers, the studio behind the show, to suspend production and to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct.  Though she did not go into detail, Olympios explained that she is currently in therapy to \"begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma\" that she sustained while shooting the show in Mexico.  She also said that she has retained an attorney to \"obtain justice.\"  \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place,\" she said, adding, \"As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.\"  A representative for Warner Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for ABC, the network on which the show airs, referred a request for comment to Warner Brothers, since the incident deals with production.  On Sunday afternoon, Warner Brothers released a statement confirming that production on season four of the show had been suspended and \"appropriate responsive action\" would be taken following a \"thorough investigation.\"  Two days later, Chris Harrison, the host of the Bachelor franchise, urged fans to \"be patient\" and apologized for \"any inconvenience and disappointment\" caused by the show's suspension.  Last week, ABC released the names of several Bachelor in Paradise contestants. In addition to Olympios, they included Raven Gates, Alexis Waters, Jasmine Goode and DeMario Jackson.

It\u2019s crazy how one person\u2019s tweet affects you.\u201d  Waddell adds, \u201cJust be real and be honest.\u201d",

This year, Jennifer and her boyfriend are planning to follow tradition by taking their kids to give back to children in need. \u201cI think the holiday season is really about giving back. One of the things that we mandate for our kids, all four of them, is to go into the Boys and Girls Club, go into the inner city \u2014 whether it\u2019s Thanksgiving or Christmas \u2014 and they have to give back,\u201d the doting dad explained. \u201cOne Christmas we made it where they only got one gift and all the gifts that were supposed to go to them, they donated to people who couldn\u2019t really afford it.

Alex said that since his two girls, Natasha, 14, and Ella, 10, know the importance of giving back during the holidays, \u201cthey don\u2019t ask for too much,\u201d he said.

Celebrating Easter together, the two fams joined forces and had an epic holiday \u2014 reportedly complete with a fun-filled egg hunt! Jennifer even performed her very first show in the Dominican Republic while there! She took the stage at the Altos de Chav\u00f3n Amphitheater on the night of Apr. 15, and was joined by Gente de Zona and ex-husband Marc Anthony for a few songs.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you love that Alex and Jennifer spent Easter together with their kids?

This past Father\u2019s Day especially got her thinking about the future, as Alex\u2019s sweet relationship with his daughters made a major impact on her. Jennifer herself has 10-year-old twins Emme and Max, while Alex is the proud father of daughters Ella, 10, and Natasha, 13. And not only does Jennifer love Alex as a partner, she adores seeing him with the kids.  \u201cJen and Alex are the real thing. They have found a love for each other that is very strong and very amazing for them both,\u201d a source close to Jennifer shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cDuring Father\u2019s Day she saw a certain side of Alex that impressed her, and seeing all along the father that Alex is has her thinking about maybe trying for one more with Alex.\u201d How sweet is that? At the same time though, Jennifer loves what she and the former MLB player currently have. For her, it\u2019s all about taking things one step at a time.  \u201cAfter a little more thinking, she\u2019s realizing what they have together already is great, and she would be just as happy with the family she has now,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cShe is actually mostly looking forward to making Alex her future husband instead of her future baby daddy. That is her priority moving forward.\u201d So despite the singer\u2019s current bout of baby fever, it seems the two are not focused on growing their family at the moment. First things first, and J.Lo has her heart set on walking down that aisle!  Jennifer paid tribute to her man on Father\u2019s Day, June 17, via Instagram with a heartfelt message accompanied by a video of Alex opening gifts. \u201cAppreciating you and loving you today and everyday for being our fearless leader, our everyday hero, for making us all laugh and enjoy this adventure we are all on together in every moment\u2026\u201d Jen wrote. \u201cFor being the ringmaster to this traveling circus we call our life!! We love you today and everyday\u2026 Happy Fathers Day to the most loving daddy to Tashi and Ella!! And thank you my love for being so beautifully loving to Emme and Max. Your kindness and generosity is never taken for granted. We are all so lucky to have you in our lives\u2026\u201d",
        "generated_text": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez may have a deep love for each other, but it seems they are not currently focused on expanding their family. While Jennifer has been feeling a bit of baby fever lately, she has also been reflecting on the happy family she already has with Alex and their own children, Max and Emme. Max and Emme recently celebrated their 10th birthday, and Jennifer took to Instagram to shower them with love and gifts. In her heartfelt tributes, she expressed her love for each of her children and her appreciation for the joy they bring to her life. Max was called her \"heart, my love, and my light,\" while Emme was called her \"soul, my inner child personified the most joyful deep and sensitive human being I have ever met.\" Despite the twins' milestone birthday, Jennifer seems more focused on her relationship with Alex and her desire to marry him than on having another child.",

Lopez made this move because she was alarmed by a story that broke in the National Enquirer in June, in which his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter claimed that the former New York Yankees third baseman isn\u2019t faithful, the report said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s sexually attracted to her,\u201d Hunter told the Enquirer.  Hunter, 34, said her affair with Rodriguez began in 2011 when he was still seeing actress Cameron Diaz. Hunter said their affair continued even after she had a baby with former football star Marcus Allen in 2014.  Hunter added that Rodriguez contacted her as recently as May about having a rendezvous, and she has the text messages to prove it. Stories about Lopez, 47, and Rodriguez, 41, dating began in March and they went public with their relationship at the Met Gala in New York in May.  But Hunter contended that he was probably imagining her when he was with Lopez and described his very adventurous sexual tastes, including threesomes.

According to Us Weekly, Lopez hired a private investigator to tail Rodriguez to confirm or debunk the allegations. In June, the National Enquirer reported that Rodriguez's alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter claimed that he is not faithful. Hunter said that their affair began in 2011 when Rodriguez was still seeing actress Cameron Diaz. Hunter said that their affair continued even after she had a baby with former football star Marcus Allen in 2014. Hunter added that Rodriguez contacted her as recently as May about having a rendezvous, and she has the text messages to prove it. Despite these allegations, Lopez and Rodriguez have been seen acting like everything is wonderful between them, gushing over each other in interviews. Earlier this month, Lopez told Extra that her beau is \"a beautiful person\" and a \"loving father\" to his daughters, Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9, whom he shares with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. Rodriguez has reportedly spent time with Lopez's 9-year-old twins Emma and Max with her ex-husband Marc Anthony.",

I want to legally bind him to me forever,\" Lawrence said. \"And, fortunately, the paperwork exists for such a thing.

For both, perhaps?  \"I f--ked that up, Brad,\" Paltrow said on the Girlboss Radio podcast when host Sophia Amoruso mentioned Gwyneth's great love of the mid-'to-late-90s, whom she met in 1994 on the set of the thriller Se7en, playing his ill-fated wife.  When he won a Golden Globe for 12 Monkeys in 1996, Pitt's final thank you was reserved for \"especially the love o' my life, my angel, Gwyneth Paltrow.\" They got engaged, they even got matching haircuts, but then they broke up in June 1997.  Paltrow has been relentless in blaming herself for the demise of their relationship, telling Diane Sawyer in 2003, \"I'm so lucky that I spent time with Brad, somebody who was such a good person! Especially when I was, like, such a mess.\" Admittedly the relentless media attention\u2014which peaked when long-lens nude photos of the couple taken while they were vacationing in the Caribbean ended up online\u2014really got to her then, understandably so.  \"My kind of internal stuff really tripped up that whole relationship,\" Paltrow said. \"And I felt really responsible, and also like I was the architect of my own misery...I just made a big mess out of it.''  The actress told Howard Stern in 2015 that her beloved father, Bruce Paltrow, who died in 2002, \"adored him like a son.\" But \"I was such a kid, I was 22 when we met. It's taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can't make that decision when you're 22 years old...I wasn't ready, and he was too good for me.\"  Only recently did Paltrow tell the New York Times that she too was subject to unwanted advances from alleged serial predator Harvey Weinstein roughly 20 years ago, when she was dating Pitt\u2014and that Pitt confronted Weinstein at an event afterward, warning the producer that something like that had best never happen again. So there was more going on at the time for Paltrow to process than anyone publicly knew about for decades.  By the time of the Sawyer sit-down, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. \"We're able to sort of see each other and smile and wish each other well,\" Paltrow said.",

The couple has only been dating for a few months, but sources claim they are already discussing the possibility of getting married next year. Johnson, 28, has confided to friends that Martin, 40, is the man she plans to marry. The couple has been traveling together as part of Martin's tour, and they plan to take things slow before making any decisions.\n\nWhile the couple's inner circle is fully supportive of their relationship, Martin's ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is not as thrilled. Paltrow, 45, was not a fan of Martin's much younger new love, and it made Martin very angry. However, Paltrow has always been supportive of Martin's choices and leaves him alone in matters of the heart.\n\nOn the other hand, actress Diane Keaton has publicly expressed her admiration for Martin, describing him as \"gorgeous\" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Keaton, 72, was immediately attracted to Martin when she saw him with Dakota Johnson at Ellen's birthday party. Keaton did not realize who Martin was until a few days later, when someone pointed out who he was to her. Despite their age difference, Keaton thinks Martin is a \"cool\" person.\n\nOverall, Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson's relationship is still in its early stages, but they seem to be taking things seriously and enjoying each other's company. Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow is happy for Chris, and Diane Keaton is openly admiring of Chris's good looks.",

Amid reports that the 42-year-old Oscar-winning actress and her 44-year-old producer beau have split, Brad was spotted out for the evening with another woman.  The former Glee executive producer took a mystery brunette out for dinner in the Venice Beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles on Tuesday.  Scroll down to video  Moving on: Brad Falchuk seemed to be over girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow when he stepped out with a mystery brunette on Tuesday in Venice, California  It may not have been a very formal affair, however, since the American Horror Story producer stayed casual in a black V-neck T-shirt under a matching black blazer.  Brad's lady friend wore her brown hair long and loose, cascading over a white jacket.  Having 'consciously uncoupled' from husband Chris Martin in March 2014, Gwyneth quickly moved on to Brad.  Breakup rumours: Gwyneth (left) and Brad (right) are reportedly heading for a split, according to the June 29 issue of Life & Style  According to a report from the June 29 issue of Life & Style, however, friends say the blonde Iron Man star and her rebound guy are about to end their relationship.  'Gwyneth is breaking up with him,' said an unnamed friend of the Mortdecai actress.  'Things got very serious very fast, but lately all they did was fight all the time and she's tired of it.'  Shorter relationship: Both Gwyneth and Brad (above on April 4) were in 10-year marriages before beginning to date at some point in 2014  The two Hollywood stars began dating at some point in 2014, shortly after Gwyneth announced her separation from rocker Chris, 38, after 10 years of marriage.  Parents to two children - 11-year-old Apple and nine-year-old Moses - Gwyneth and Chris finalized their divorce in April 2015.  Unfortunately, differences in lifestyles and outlook may have ended up being too much for Gwyneth and her new man.  Diva concerns? According to an unnamed source, Gwyneth's fussiness was a major point of contention between her and Brad; here she is seen in London on Friday  Just a basic guy: Reports indicated that Brad (above in October) was more easygoing and just wanted a burger at times  'Gwyn likes things a certain way and Brad didn't cater to her, so they ended up bickering over the smallest things,' the same anonymous source continued.  'She can be very fussy when it comes to food and Brad isn't. Sometimes he just wanted to go out for a burger, which drove her crazy.'  Still, Gwyneth claimed to love burgers and fries in a GOOP post in early June where she gushed over a new fast food restaurant in Brooklyn.  Conscious uncoupling: Coldplay rocker Chris Martin was married to Gwyneth for a decade before they separated in spring 2014; here they are seen in October 2012  Neither Gwyneth nor Brad has confirmed the split.  Brad, meanwhile, has had plenty of work to distract him from his relationship woes - the former Glee executive producer has moved on to the next installment of American Horror Story, as well as new series American Crime Story and Scream Queens.  Gwyneth has previously dated Brad Pitt, Luke Wilson, Donovon Leitch and Ben Affleck.",

        "doc_2_text": "Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 8:45PM  our ongoing adventures at TIFF. An abdriged version of this review was originally published in Nathaniel's column at Towleroad.  Film festivals nearly always provide curious dialogues between films that you weren't expecting. On the same day on the exact same screen at TIFF I managed to see two films about female writers and the male writers in their lives who take up all the oxygen (and praise) in the room. Who would have thought that a film about the origins of Frankenstein (just discussed) and a star vehicle for Glenn Close in Stockholm would have so much in common?  THE WIFE (Bj\u00f6rn Runge)  Joan Castleman (Glenn Close) is a longsuffering wife who would bristle at that very description. She's married to a famous novelist Joe Castleman (Jonathan Pryce) and their homophonic names are no coincidence. The silver-haired couple have been together for nearly half a century and are inseparable if not quite interchangeable...  As The Wife begins we learn that Joe has just been named the Nobel prize winner in literature and the couple are to travel to Stockholm together for the ceremony. They're so happy they actually jump on their bed together in a singularly charming scene. This slow burn story may start out playful but it deepens as it goes thanks to Close's brilliant work.  the younger and the older CastlemansAll the principle characters in Joe's orbit also happen to be writers and resent him, if not quite his enormous success, for different reasons: his son David (Max Irons) never gets the encouragement he needs, his wife Joan was a promising writer who set her own career aside when she married him, and then there's Nathaniel (Christian Slater) who's been trailing the family for years trying to get permission to write Joe's biography.  The cracks in the happy marriage facade begin to show as the Nobel ceremony nears and flashbacks pile up. Annie Starke, Close's own daughter, plays her as a young college student and Elizabeth McGoven gives great cameo as an aggressive lady author who warns her away from the sexist literary world which just won't let women succeed. Bj\u00f6rn Runge, a Swedish director making his first English language film, doesn't find many ways to visualize all of the drama - it's mostly two or more characters arguing in rooms, planes, or hotels, but he's great with the actors who all deliver in this adaptation of Meg Wolitzer's bestseller.  The interpersonal dynamics and face-offs are the savory meat of the film. To my personal astonishment Glenn Close restricts herself to chewing on it rather than the scenery! Put simply it's the best work she's done in over 20 years.  Close's opacity as an actress, the unknowability of that glacial face, has often been disguised by her sheer volume and ferocity in so many gorgon roles. Here in Joan's quieter less sinister register, she's spectacular. You constantly attempt to figure Joan out but Joan will not have it. She prefers to remain a mystery, hiding her true feelings from everyone, including possibly herself. Her mercurial moods will shift within scenes; just when you expect her to double down on anger she'll throw compassion at you, and vice versa, keeping you off balance. At one point in a brilliantly acted private 'date' with that would-be biographer, she says \"I'm shy\" with something like mock flirtation. It sounds like a lie, but it's actually the truth of this mesmerizing character.  The film isn't quite as coy as Close, eventually revealing its hand. Joan Castleman and her poker face would not approve. But that, in a nutshell, is the satisfying friction of the film, a star vehicle wherein the star keeps threatening to jump from her own limo.

The film explores the couple's relationship as it unravels under the pressure of Joe's literary success and the resentment of his son and wife.\n\nClose's performance in the film was widely praised, with some calling it the best work she has done in over 20 years.

They have quoted some sources as claiming that Ellen has been approached to get a girlfriend for Drew! The source allegedly told the magazine:  \u201cEllen immediately offered to help her find the right woman. She\u2019s very supportive of Drew and thinks it\u2019s wonderful that she\u2019s exploring her options for love.\u201d  The source further claims that Drew has already drawn up a list of Hollywood\u2019s finest women and stars and handed it over to Ellen to arrange for some dates.  You may like to read Irish TV presenter Graham Norton slams celebrities and billionaires for tax evasion!  The truth  The report does sound ridiculous! Gossip Cop decided to investigate it further and found that all that has been reported in the tabloid is sheer nonsense and untrue.  A close and reliable source has negated the story and its contents. Last year on one of her appearances on Elle\u2019s show, Drew had rejected all the proposals that Ellen had brought for Drew. Drew also admitted that she is not aware of how to use the dating apps.  Drew had told Ellen:  \u201cMy friend\u2019s on a dating app. It\u2019s like circus of the stars. It\u2019s crazy\u2026 My other girlfriend said she\u2019s going on a three-month no-swiping thing.

She had told Contact Magazine:  \u201cDo I like women sexually? Yeah, I do. Totally. I have always considered myself bisexual\u2026 I love a woman\u2019s body. I think a woman and a woman together are beautiful, just as a man and a woman together are beautiful. Being with a woman is like exploring your own body, but through someone else.\u201d  Even though Drew had accepted that she is bisexual, the claim that she has begged Ellen to find her a female partner is far-fetched and unbelievable.

She dated Rick Salomon when she was 15. She dated Corey Feldman in 1989.  She was close to Balthazar Getty in 1990.

Her allergies  Drew Barrymore seems to be having some sort of incompatibilities with men as well as female partners. She does not seem to get along well with her partners.  Most of her love stories are short-lived and seem to end even before they begin. The exact reason for it is unknown. One can say that she seems to develop some sort of allergy to them over a short time!  But Drew is also known to have true allergies to certain ingredients of this universe! These include garlic, coffee, perfume, and bee stings. The allergy to perfumes, bee stings, and coffee does not trouble her as much as her allergy to garlic.  It is one of the severe types of allergies. Due to it, Drew has to carefully look through the labels of the packed items and jars and check whether they contain any garlic before she can purchase them or think about consuming them!  Garlic allergy  Drew has a very rare kind of allergy. Garlic allergy is not all that common. When it occurs, it could manifest as skin hives or respiratory symptoms.

Six women are suing Weinstein and what they call the \u201cWeinstein Sexual Enterprise\u201d, which they say includes his brother Bob and their co-founded studio The Weinstein Company, claiming they conspired to conceal Weinstein\u2019s widespread alleged sexual harassment.  The plaintiffs argue that, due to the scale of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the producer\u2019s \u201csexual enterprise\u201d should be considered an organised crime group.  Lawyers for the Hollywood mogul filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Tuesday, arguing that it was \u201cfatally overboard\u201d, and would apply to \u201call women who ever met with Weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm\u201d.

Her comment follows Streep firing back at Weinstein, who said the action was \u201cpathetic and exploitative\u201d after his lawyers cited her saying she was never harassed by the producer in an attempt to shut the case down.  Lawyers Phyllis Kupferstein and Mary E Flynn wrote that this would include actresses such as Streep and Lawrence who have not made allegations of sexual misconduct.    They pointed to Streep saying Weinstein had always been respectful with her during their collaborations in a statement to the press.    They did not mention that Streep also praised the \u201cheroes\u201d who made allegations about his behaviour, which she said was \u201cinexcusable\u201d and an \u201cabuse of power\u201d.    Weinstein\u2019s lawyers also tried to undermine the lawsuit\u2019s claims by saying Gwyneth Paltrow went on to work with him again after he allegedly harassed her.    The original lawsuit argued the statute of limitations on the allegations does not apply because the alleged victims were under duress not to make the claims earlier.    Weinstein, 65, has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.",

        "doc_1_text": "    There is a modern trend of Hollywood mining established franchises to minimize the risk of a flop at the box office. Disney\u2019s Tomorrowland is one example of a costly film ($190 million) based on an original idea that fell well short of recouping its production costs, further discouraging studios from bringing new properties to the big screen in the process. Remakes/reboots aren\u2019t a surefire thing either though, what with this year\u2019s Ghostbusters featuring an A-list cast and grossing $220 million worldwide \u2013 but doing so on a $140 million production budget, marketing not included.  Spinoffs are more popular than ever right now for related reasons, and Warner Bros. Pictures is moving forward with one such project in Ocean\u2019s Eight: a spin-off to the popular George Clooney and Brad Pitt-starring Ocean\u2019s Eleven franchise, featuring all-female leads. The movie recently started filming, with Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett being spotted on set in New York.  Ocean\u2019s Eight, which is set to be released during the (already packed) 2018 summer season, also stars Anne Hathaway (The Dark Knight Rises), Rihanna (Battleship), Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story), Mindy Kaling (The Mindy Project), Helena Bonham Carter (the Harry Potter series), and Awkwafina (Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising). Coming Soon has just posted new Ocean\u2019s Eight set photos from New York that feature Carter with Blanchett and Bullock \u2013 and tease Anne Hathaway\u2019s role in the film.      It\u2019s been reported that Sandra Bullock is playing Danny Ocean\u2019s (George Clooney) ex-con sister in Ocean\u2019s Eight, with Cate Blanchett occupying Rusty\u2019s (Brad Pitt) sidekick role to Bullock. The pair will reportedly work alongside others to steal a necklace from the Met Ball, with the intention of pinning the heist on a \u201cvillainous gallery owner.\u201d  What\u2019s perhaps most interesting is Anne Hathaway\u2019s role in Ocean\u2019s Eight. While not featured live in these set photos, Hathaway is prominently displayed on an ad atop the taxi that Bullock, Blanchett, and Carter are exiting in the images. It thus appears that Hathaway will be some sort of a celebrity in the upcoming film.  It is worth noting that Ocean\u2019s Twelve included a joke where Julia Roberts played both Danny\u2019s wife and, well, Julia Roberts. So, it is possible that Anne Hathaway could be playing a similar double role, where she impersonates her doppelganger, Academy-Award winner Anne Hathaway. Odds are likely against using that joke a second time, so expect Hathaway\u2019s character to be someone of fame and/or importance in the upcoming film.  Ocean\u2019s Eight opens in U.S. theaters on June 8th, 2018.  Source: Coming Soon",

Rumors are rife that Hollywood superstars Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock might be dating and that the budding relationship, if true, was nudged at by another big star and close friend to the two, George Clooney.  Months after the controversial separation that led to Angelina Jolie filing for divorce from Pitt, reports are swirling around that Pitt might just be on the road of moving on with the help of the \"Ocean's Eight\" actress.  Back in September 2016, fans of Pitt and Jolie were deeply shocked after both camps confirmed that their marriage is not working anymore, thus the need for divorce due to \"irreconcilable differences.\" Pitt and Jolie have been known as one of the most adored couples in Hollywood. They have been married since 2014 and have six children.  This month, the Australian paper New Idea claims that Pitt and Bullock have been \"discreetly\" going out in \"secret dates and private phone calls\" and the report maintains that the two are \"taking things 'to the next level.'\"  \"They've always moved in the same crowd but the timing has been wrong \u2013 either he's been with someone, or she has. But now they're finally free to take their chemistry to the next level,\" New Idea's unnamed source added.  The same New Idea report was also the one to spill that \"insiders confirm\" Clooney built up the grounds for Pitt and Bullock to start dating.  However, a recent report from PEOPLE magazine refutes the claims that Pitt is dating anybody. According to the publication, Pitt is savoring every moment of his single life and is not rushing to look for a new love.  On the other hand, PEOPLE's source shares that while Pitt is not dating anyone, the \"Allied\" actor has finally found the time to welcome back old friends to his life, which is one of the factors that have been helping him move on from the recent failed marriage with Jolie.  Aside from spending time with old friends and his kids, Pitt reportedly developed an affinity for sculpture while working on a lineup of movies which he will either star in or produce, PEOPLE adds.",

With so much attention being paid to Angie\u2019s most recent beau, why not reflect on some of her past relationships? Some of which are likely to surprise you!  Jonny Lee Miller  Prior to Pitt, Angelina had actually been married twice. The first was to fellow actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met on the set of the 1996 film Hackers.

Billy Bob Thornton  Those who recall it may associate Angelina and Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s relationship with her darker, wild-child days.

However, their short 2003 fling was kept so quiet that only a few sightings of them being romantic at parties were ever reported in the media.  Jenny Shimizu  For decades, Angelina Jolie has been open about her attraction to both men and women. However, only one woman has ever been known to steal the starlet\u2019s heart: model and actress Jenny Shimizu. The pair met on the set of Foxfire, and according to Jolie, it was love at first sight.",
        "generated_text": "Angelina Jolie has been in the public eye for decades, and her love life has been just as headline-grabbing as her acting career. From her high-profile relationship with Brad Pitt to her more recent beaus, there have been several surprises along the way. Here are some of the most shocking relationships Angelina has been in, from her brief flings to her longest-lasting marriage.\n\nBefore she was married to Brad Pitt, Angelina was married twice. Her first marriage was to fellow actor Jonny Lee Miller, whom she met on the set of the 1996 film Hackers. The couple got hitched six months after shooting ended and ultimately divorced three years later, though they remain friends to this day.\n\nAfter her divorce from Miller, Angelina was romantically linked with Billy Bob Thornton, who she married in Las Vegas after just two months of courtship. The couple was famous for their frequent PDA, 20-year age difference, and wearing vials of each other's blood. Their marriage came to an end in 2003.\n\nAngelina has also been romantically linked with several other celebrities, including Val Kilmer and Nicolas Cage. However, both of these relationships were kept so quiet that only a few sightings of them being romantic at parties were ever reported in the media.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising relationship of Angelina's career was her marriage to Billy Bob Thornton. The couple was famous for their frequent PDA, 20-year age difference, and wearing vials of each other's blood. Their marriage came to an end in 2003.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Darren Aronofsky have also sparked rumors that they're back together again after attending an event together last night. Aronofsky and Lawrence started dating after making the movie Mother! together. They were spotted kissing in New York in October 2016, but went on to split up in November 2017. Having spent just over a year together, the actress and director remained friends, and have been spotted together on several occasions since. Whether or not Lawrence is actually dating Aronofsky again has yet to be confirmed, but the prospect seems more than possible.",

As the Oscar-winning actress explained to her mother, fellow actress Blythe Danner in a recent Goop podcast called \"Gwyneth x Blythe: On Mothers and Daughters,\" she was truly in a \"dark place\" after the birth of her second child, Moses, 12 years ago.  \"I think (it) was really shocking to me because I never thought that I would be a person who got postnatal depression,\" the 45-year-old explained.  Paltrow and ex-Chris Martin are the parents to Moses and Apple, 13.  And Apple's birth was so delightful, she recalled, that the postpartum took her by surprise.  \"I was so euphoric when Apple was born, and I assumed it would happen with Mosey and it just ... it took a while,\" she said. \"I really went into a dark place.\"  This isn't the first time Paltrow has discussed her postpartum depression; in 2015 she told Entertainment Tonight, \"(My case) was low-grade enough that I didn't have to be hospitalized, but it's a very debilitating thing, and I think there's so much shame around it and there shouldn't be.\"  In 2011 she told Good Housekeeping that after her son's birth, \"I felt like a zombie. I couldn't access my heart. I couldn't access my emotions. I couldn't connect ... With (Apple), I was on cloud nine. I couldn't believe it wasn't the same. I just thought it meant I was a terrible mother and a terrible person.\"  Martin was the one who called her attention to her changed attitude, and \"that sort of burst the bubble,\" said Paltrow.  These days, she's fully recovered and engaged to producer Brad Falchuk.  \"I thought postpartum depression meant you were sobbing every single day and incapable of looking after a child,\" she said in 2011. \"But there are different shades of it and depths of it, which is why I think it's so important for women to talk about it. It was a trying time. I felt like a failure.\"  Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter.",

In a National Enquirer story labeled \u201cridiculous\u201d by Travolta\u2019s camp, pilot Doug Gotterba said he first met the \u201cGrease\u201d star in February 1981 when he interviewed for a pilot job \u2013 and by September they were lovers.  \u201cI know the date (the affair began) because I still have the log book and records,\u201d Gotterba, 62, told the Enquirer.  He said they flew to Monterey, Calif., together and shared a \u201cfantastic\u201d bottle of merlot wine over dinner at the Highlands resort in Carmel.  \u201cI got the sense I was being courted,\u201d Gotterba said. \u201cAs we walked from the restaurant back to the room, John suddenly said, \u201cHey, would you like a massage?'\u201d  Gotterba said he\u2019d expected the invitation, and the massage quickly led to sex.  \u201cJohn was gentle but very passionate. The next day he told me with a big smile on his face, \u2018I really enjoyed last night,'\u201d Gotterba told the Enquirer.  Douglas Gotterba in undated photo  He said Travolta, 58, took him on more romantic trips to Hawaii, Amsterdam and Kenya.  \u201cSometimes he\u2019d bring women along as beards, but he would ask me to join him in his suite and we\u2019d spend the nights together. It was our little secret,\u201d Gotterba claimed.  The pilot said he encouraged Travolta to get a girlfriend as cover, and that\u2019s when the actor started dating Brooke Shields.  \u201cThere was no chemistry between them. They\u2019d smile for the cameras and everyone assumed they were a couple,\u201d he said.  The affair ended in 1986 after growing tensions, Gotterba said.  \u201cHe\u2019d show up on my door many times, unannounced, to check up on me,\u201d the pilot told the Enquirer. \u201cHe\u2019d disappear into my bedroom and go through my drawers. He always tried to catch me cheating on him.\u201d  He said Travolta would ignore him for days if he didn\u2019t drop everything to be with him on a moment\u2019s notice.  Their last meeting was years later in 1992, after Travolta married actress Kelly Preston.  \u201cWe were making small talk when suddenly, I blurted out, \u2018So, John, tell me. Now that you\u2019re married, do you still prefer men \u2013 or women?'\u201d Gotterba said he asked. \u201cWell, Doug, I still prefer men,\u201d Travolta replied, according to Gotterba.  The Enquirer report follows three months after two anonymous masseurs \u2013 John Does 1 and 2 \u2013 filed and later dropped federal lawsuits claiming Travolta groped them during massages.  The first Doe withdrew his legal claim after Travolta proved he was in New York on the day of the alleged Beverly Hills attack.  Travolta\u2019s camp immediately dismissed the Enquirer\u2019s interview with Gotterba.  \u201cThis ridiculous so-called \u2018new\u2019 story is a retread of a story published a few weeks ago by the same desperate supermarket tabloid \u2013 the same tabloid that impossibly claimed that John Travolta had an encounter with \u2018Doe #1\u2019 in Beverly Hills when he was actually on the east coast working on a movie,\u201d Travolta\u2019s rep said in a statement Wednesday.  ndillon@nydailynews.com",

Brad Pitt likes to drop by and play with her 5-year-old son Samson; wellness guru Deepak Chopra calls for advice. And Laura Day, the object of all this celebrity attention? \u201cI\u2019m not what you expect,\u201d she insists. \u201cI\u2019m just your basic, straitlaced Jewish woman.\u201d  Who believes\u2014as do her fans\u2014that she has a highly accurate sense of intuition. \u201cIntuition allows us to predict events,\u201d claims Day, 38. She maintains that everyone has such abilities,, waiting to be developed; her 1996 how-to book, Practical Intuition, sold 133,000 hardcover copies, and her 1997 follow-up, Practical Intuition for Success, is the first part of a two-book, $3 million deal. Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). \u201cI don\u2019t see hallucinations, it\u2019s just a flash of something in my head,\u201d says Day, who\u2019s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. \u201cI\u2019m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There\u2019s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.\u201d  So how to explain all those A-list amigos? \u201cShe\u2019s very open and loving,\u201d says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. \u201cI had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,\u201d recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. \u201cLaura\u2019s information saved Zoe\u2019s life,\u201d says Arquette. \u201cIt was intense.\u201d  Day\u2019s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn\u2019t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore\u2014or \u201cAunt Demi,\u201d as she\u2019s known to Samson\u2014worked with Day on the set of 199l\u2019s The Butcher\u2019s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. \u201cLaura has given me a trust in my own intuition,\u201d says the actress, who won\u2019t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day\u2019s intervention. \u201cI took a greater position of responsibility,\u201d says Moore. \u201cLaura put me back in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d  Day says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. \u201cI wanted her to live,\u201d says Day, \u201cand I needed to know what to do.\u201d She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian\u2019s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.  Day went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. \u201cAt the point when you\u2019re most lost,\u201d says Day, \u201cthat\u2019s when intuition kicks in.\u201d  Intuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success\u2014she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate\u2014allows her to \u201cdo bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.\u201d A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. \u201cPeople are drawn to Laura,\u201d says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day\u2019s boyfriend of three years. \u201cShe makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.\u201d  And yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. \u201cI don\u2019t want my environment perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cI work very hard to live in the moment.

The 47-year-old actress, who tied the knot to the Bond actor in 2011, confessed that it was never an \u2018ambition\u2019 of hers to marry until she met Daniel Craig, in a new interview with ES Magazine.  The Oscar-winning star revealed she was \u2018very independent\u2019 in her youth and had even struggled to watch chick flicks, before love just \u2018happened\u2019 one day with the actor, 49.  Rachel Weisz says marriage \u2018isn\u2019t particularly exceptional\u2019 (Picture: PA)  Speaking of their relationship, she said: \u2018It\u2019s very personal, it\u2019s very private.

They began dating the same year and went on to tie the knot in New York in 2011.  Rachel Weisz: My marriage to Daniel Craig isn\u2019t particularly exceptional (Picture: Evening Standard Magazine)  She also touched on the sexual misconduct scandal that has been shaking up Hollywood as she spoke of her friend Sophie Dix, who has accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment.  \u2018My friend Sophie Dix has been talking about this since the 1990s,\u2019 she said. \u2018She would tell anyone who would listen to her story, for the last 20 years. And no-one seemed to care.\u2019  When asked why it took two decades for the media to pick up on the allegations against Weinstein, she said of the movie mogul, who denies non-consensual sex: \u2018I think his power was on the wane\u2026  \u2018It\u2019s about economics, (not) turning over the big bucks any more. That\u2019s not an optimistic thing to say, but this is all about power and money.\u2019  The full interview appears in this week\u2019s issue of ES Magazine, available on 25 January.

But Johnson was quick to shut down rumors that she and the musician were expecting a child together. She explained that the balloon colors were just a coincidence\u2014and maybe a poor color scheme choice. \"The only thing I'm pregnant with is a lot of really good ideas,\" she told Ellen Degeneres shortly after the rumors spread. \"But not any babies.\"    Meanwhile, Paltrow just tied the knot with producer Brad Falchuk in an intimate celebration in The Hamptons.

Kunis\u2019s family came to the US from the USSR with only $250 when she was a child. Portman\u2019s parents, descended from Holocaust survivors, emigrated to the US from Israel for her father\u2019s work as a doctor.  Kunis is brash and sexy \u2014 the black swan to Portman\u2019s swan princess \u2014 and Portman is all grace and quiet strength, shocking the Jewish world with her controversial choice not to accept an award alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Their love stories are intertwined, as Kunis revealed on Monday on Marc Maron\u2019s podcast \u201cWTF.\u201d  Forwarding the News Thoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day. Terms (Required) I agree to the Forward's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Email (Required)  Portman, who after playing Queen Amidalah in \u201cStar Wars\u201d became perhaps the most lusted-after woman in the galaxy, famously fell in love on the set of the 2010 film that won her an Oscar \u2014 \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d Portman and Kunis played rivals in a ballet company, and Portman fell in love with their choreographer and co-star, French ballet dancer Benjamin Millepied, who later converted to Judaism. He and Portman are married and raising two children, Aleph and Amelia.  On Maron\u2019s podcast, Kunis divulged that Portman also played a role in her romance with her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, with whom she is, like Portman, raising two Jewish children, Wyatt and Dmitri. Kunis and Kutcher co-starred in the sitcom \u201cThat 70\u2019s Show\u201d for eight years \u2014 Kunis was cast when she was only 14 \u2014 but she says they had \u201cno feelings whatsoever\u201d for each other. Though their characters were romantically involved, leading to plenty of steamy on-screen scenes, \u201cThere was nothing there,\u201d Kunis remembers. \u201cIt was like \u2026 whatever,\u201d she says. They were friends.  Kunis went on to date fellow child star Macauley Culkin for eight years. Kutcher famously wed actress Demi Moore, and the couple eventually filed for divorce, which was finalized after\u2026 eight years of marriage. (See how much weird symmetry there is in this story?)  In 2011, Kunis was cast in a movie called \u201cFriends With Benefits,\u201d about a man and woman who decide to add a sexual component to their friendship, believing they\u2019ll be able to stay otherwise platonic. Of course, they fall in love. Her co-star wasn\u2019t Ashton Kutcher, which would have been too easy; it was Justin Timberlake.  In 2011, Kutcher was cast in a movie called \u201cNo Strings Attached,\u201d about a man and woman who decide to add a sexual component to their friendship, believing they\u2019ll be able to stay otherwise platonic. Of course, they fall in love. His co-star was none other than Natalie Portman.  One night, Kunis says, she was backstage at an awards show. She saw an attractive man \u2014 from her vantage point, she could only see his profile \u2014 and began wondering who he was. He turned. It was Ashton Kutcher. She had been admiring the man she\u2019d known for almost 15 years. They began seeing each other.  \u201cWe never dated,\u201d Kunis said. \u201cWe hooked up.\u201d Kunis was starring in a movie about casual sex with friends. Kutcher was doing the same. \u201cWe lived out our movies,\u201d she said. (Really makes you wonder what she does when she\u2019s in movies about crime.)  Any romantic-comedy fan knows exactly what\u2019s going to happen next.  The affair lasted three months, then something shifted. Kunis began to have feelings for her longtime friend. \u201cI walked up to him, and I was like, \u2018You know what? I actually care about you, and I don\u2019t want to mess anything up, so I\u2019m just going to walk away before it becomes too much,\u2019\u201d she says.  \u201cThe next day, he showed up to my house, and he was like, \u2018Move in with me,\u2019\u201d she remembers.  And so she did.  Why did it take so long for the photogenic couple to come together?  Kunis says it had to happen the way it happened. \u201cWe would have never been together if we didn\u2019t both go through what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we met,\u201d she says. \u201cReconnected I should say \u2014 not met.\u201d  Jenny Singer is the deputy lifestyle editor for the Forward.

The insider added: \u201cKurt was in a mood yelling at his co-stars. They were both acting out a little, and he was on a jealousy kick that hadn\u2019t really shown itself.

        "doc_1_text": "(1974-)  Who Is Amy Adams?  Amy Adams pursued dancing as well as musical theater and auditioned for TV and film roles until she landed several that launched her into fame. Adams has since starred in such popular films as Junebug, Enchanted, Doubt, Julie & Julia and Man of Steel, among many others. She has received several Academy Award nominations and earned Golden Globes for her performances in American Hustle, Big Eyes and the miniseries Sharp Objects.  Early Life  Actress Amy Lou Adams was born on August 20, 1974, in Vicenza, Italy. She was the fourth of seven children born to Americans Kathryn and Richard Kent Adams, with her father stationed at Caserma Ederle military base at the time of her birth. The Adams family, which were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, relocated from one base to another until they settled in Castle Rock, Colorado when Adams was about eight years old.  Adams sang in the Douglas County High School choir and, aspiring to become a ballerina, trained as an apprentice at a local dance company. Later, she decided the rigidity of ballet training was ill-suited for her, and she began to pursue a career in musical theater instead.  Movies and TV Roles  In the mid-1990s, Adams worked as a dancer at a number of different theaters and playhouses in Colorado and Minnesota. By the end of the decade, she landed her first film role in the comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous. Shortly thereafter, encouraged by co-star Kirstie Alley, Adams relocated to Los Angeles and auditioned for more roles. She landed one on a television series, but it was later canceled.  Adams went on to appear in several small films and guest star on TV series. She was also chosen to appear in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) as Brenda Strong \u2014 a role that, according to Spielberg, should have launched Adams's career. But it wasn't until she starred in the 2005 film Junebug that Adams made her breakthrough: She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as a Special Jury Prize for her performance after Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival.  'Enchanted' and 'Julie & Julia'  In 2007, Adams landed the lead in the fantasy musical Enchanted, portraying a Disney cartoon songstress who enters the three-dimensional world. The following year she received another Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role as a nun in 2008's Doubt, co-starring Meryl Streep. Then in 2009, she starred as a young, aspiring cook in Julie & Julia, the popular culinary comedy about famed chef Julia Child. Adams once again starred alongside Streep, with the project directed by late filmmaker Nora Ephron and receiving wide acclaim, earning nearly $130 million at the global box office.  A March 2008 MSNBC article called Adams Hollywood's new \"It Girl,\" adding that she's still uncomfortable with all of her \"It-ness.\" The article quoted Adams as saying, \"I always equated 'It Girls' to, like, having a certain type of sexuality. So, for me, I don't think like that. I don't associate that with myself at this time. I've been working, which is so grounding and you don't sort of get a sense of the outside world when you're working.\"  'Doubt' and 'American Hustle'  Adams has continued to take on an array of roles to much acclaim, earning Academy Award nominations her for roles in the dramas The Fighter (2010), directed by David O. Russell, and The Master (2012), from Paul Thomas Anderson. The actress has also taken on lighter fare such as Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (2008), Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and The Muppets (2011).  In 2013, she entered comic-book fandom with her portrayal of reporter Lois Lane in Man of Steel and reprised the role for the 2016 sequel Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Also in 2013 she starred opposite The Fighter co-star Christian Bale in the ensemble cast of American Hustle, once again helmed by Russell. Adams was nominated for yet another Oscar, her first for Lead Actress and this time for her role as a '70s-era con artist caught in a web of conflicting interests. She also won a Golden Globe for the performance.  'Big Eyes,' 'Sharp Objects' and 'Vice'  In 2014, Adams starred in Big Eyes, playing artist Margaret Keane and winning her second Golden Globe for her efforts. In 2016, Adams received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for her starring role in the sci-fi blockbuster Arrival, based on the short story Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang. That same year she starred in the psychological thriller Nocturnal Animals, directed by Tom Ford and co-starring Jake Gyllenhaal, and in 2017 she returned as Lois Lane for the superhero ensemble Justice League.  Adams went on to co-produce and star in the Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e-directed adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Sharp Objects, earning a Golden Globe for her lead performance in the dark miniseries. She also earned Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for her portrayal of Lynne Cheney, wife of former vice president Dick Cheney, in Vice (2018).  Husband and Daughter  Adams began dating fellow actor Darren Le Gallo in 2001. She gave birth to their daughter Aviana Olea Le Gallo on May 15, 2010. Adams and Le Gallo were married on May 2, 2015.

While speaking about a variety of topics including fatherhood and President Trump, Clooney said that the main reason he isn\u2019t acting much right now is because it doesn\u2019t particularly interest him and because he hasn\u2019t read a really amazing script in a while.  \u201cI\u2019m in an interesting place in my life,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cI\u2019m acting almost never \u2014 for a lot of reasons, mostly because I don\u2019t have any great interest in it and haven\u2019t read anything [good enough].\u201d  Clooney went on to say that if someone approached him right now with the script of a lifetime, he would jump on it, and so it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s completely left acting behind.

Clooney has previously directed The Monuments Men, The Ides of March, Leatherheads, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. But Suburbicon will be the first movie that Clooney directs that he does not also act in.  The last film that George Clooney acted in was Money Monster, released in May 2016 to mixed reviews from critics.

        "doc_2_text": "When Leann Rimes and Eddie Cibrian fell in love on the set of Northern Lights, things were already looking a little bleak for the American actor. Here was a guy with the looks of a genuine Hollywood leading star - a guy who had served his time on U.S. television (Sunset Beach), like many A-listers before him, George Clooney, Kevin Bacon, etc. So why has Cibrian - who turned 40 last week - lost his way in the tangled world of Hollywood?  Eddie Cibrian [L] and LeAnn Rimes [R] At The ACM Music Awards  In 2006, Cibrian joined the cast of Fox show Vanished midway through the series. The show focused on the disappearance of the wife of a Georgia senator, which is revealed as being part of a wider conspiracy. The family of the missing woman, a pair of FBI agents and a journalist are drawn into the ever-evolving mystery - sounds alright doesn't it? Well, it wasn't. And it was cancelled after nine of the thirteen episodes. Yep, that means Fox deemed it wasn't even worth revealing where the wife of the Georgian senator ended up.  Next for Cibrian came a rather uninspiring casting as Jason Austin in the ABC remake of ITV's British drama Footballers Wives. Called Football Wives, the show actually boasted a pretty decent cast including Gabrielle Union, Lucy Lawless, Ving Rhames and James Van Der Beek, though, surprise surprise, the network chose not to pick up the show.  Eddie Cibrian Filming Ugly Betty In New York City  Following the Football Wives disappointment, married man Cibrian had a much-publicized affair with LeAnn Rimes, the popular American country star. The couple went public with their romance in August of that year, with Cibrian filing for divorce from his wife Brandi Glanville. \"I can't change the past and I'm truly sorry that people got hurt along the way but not everything reported in the media is reality and continuing to rehash things publicly only makes it more difficult for everyone to heal,\" the actor said in a statement to E! Online.  Guest spots on Samantha Who? Dirty Sexy Money and Ugly Betty followed for Cibrian and he later joined the cast of CSI: Miami as an officer from the Hollywood division. It's probably exactly the sort of thing that he needed to be doing, though Cibrian's contract was not picked up for the 2010-2011 season.  Watch Eddie Cibrian and LeAnn Rimes Leaving The Malibu Fair:    That year, the actor guest starred as a bounty hunter on multiple episodes of NBC's drama series Chase though a huge opportunity came in March 2011,when Cibrian was cast as the lead in the NBC pilot for The Playboy Club, a big-bidget TV series focusing on the first Playboy Club in Chicago in 1962 and starring Hollywood actress Amber Heard.  Out of nowhere, the show became the first cancellation of 2011-12 television season, though it appeared to be no fault of Cibrian, with critics tearing the writing apart. Despite his website dubbing the show one of the most anticipated of the year, Tim Goodman of the Hollywood Reporter said of The Playboy Club, \"It was [a] bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once.\"  LeAnn Rimes has sold over 37 million records worldwide and retains a large following across the world.

Eddie Cibrian [L] and LeAnn Rimes [R] At The Friend Movement Campaign Benefit  Cibrian is clearly a talented actor, who may yet find an interesting role on television despite the fickle nature of the American small-screen business. He needs network backing, good scripts and decent co-stars: not too much to ask for is it?  Until that role comes calling, he'll star in Tyler Perry's Single Moms Club set for release in 2014. After that, it's The Best Man Holiday - a comedy with Terrence Howard. Sigh.",

        "doc_1_text": "American attorney and businessman (1944\u20132003)  This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 \u2013 September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life and education  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (1917\u20132012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (1917\u20132008), both Armenian Americans.[1] He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas \"Tom\" Kardashian.[2][3] The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire.[4] Once in the United States, Arthur's father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage.[citation needed]  He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived at 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue.[5] Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as president and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[13] Simpson was the best man at Kardashian and Kris Houghton's wedding in 1978.  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[14] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[15]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense \"Dream Team\", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[16] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[17]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: \"I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.\"[16] Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at his home in Encino, Los Angeles, at age 59,[18][19] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[20]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[21]  Personal life  Kardashian dated Priscilla Presley from 1975 to 1976.[22][23] The pair were introduced by Kardashian's sister-in-law Joan, who had previously been married to Joe Esposito, road manager for Elvis.[24][25] On an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, his daughter Kim stated that the two were briefly engaged.  Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob.[26]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[27][28][29] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment in 1999.[30] Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife, Kris, and their children \"were instrumental\" in the demise of the relationship.[31][32][33] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (n\u00e9e Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[34][17]  See also",

        "generated_text": "In the competitive world of politics, candidates must be prepared for any challenge, even if it means getting savaged by dogs. Rory Tolan, son of Fine Gael councillor Sharon Tolan, made headlines when he interrupted Taoiseach Enda Kenny's campaign in Kells, Ireland. The 9-year-old political hopeful informed Mr. Kenny that he was also planning to become a councillor. Although the incident was not as traumatic as it was for Mr. Ring, it brought back memories of his own horror story from the 1997 campaign, where he was also bitten by a terrier dog.\n\nMeanwhile, in another political-themed incident, former politician Ivan Yates missed out on a local shop's apple tarts that were delivered to the battle bus where Wexford candidates were debating. The tweeting voter shared a picture of the desserts, jokingly noting that \"people are very kind when they hear Ivan is in Dublin.\"\n\nAs the political season heats up, it's never too early to show political ambition, as evidenced by Rory Tolan's bid to become a councillor. It's not just politicians who have encountered canine candidates, however. The attorney and businessman Robert Kardashian, known for his close friendship with O.J. Simpson, also had a dog-eat-candidate moment. Kardashian was one of Simpson's defense attorneys during his controversial 1995 murder trial. Although Kardashian himself was not savaged by a dog, his friendship with Simpson and his role in the trial made him a target for criticism and controversy.",

For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 \u2013 September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life and education  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (1917\u20132012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (1917\u20132008), both Armenian Americans.[1] He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas \"Tom\" Kardashian.[2][3] The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire.[4] Once in the United States, Arthur's father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage.[citation needed]  He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived at 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue.[5] Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as president and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[13] Simpson was the best man at Kardashian and Kris Houghton's wedding in 1978.  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[14] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[15]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense \"Dream Team\", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[16] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[17]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: \"I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.\"[16] Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at his home in Encino, Los Angeles, at age 59,[18][19] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[20]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[21]  Personal life  Kardashian dated Priscilla Presley from 1975 to 1976.[22][23] The pair were introduced by Kardashian's sister-in-law Joan, who had previously been married to Joe Esposito, road manager for Elvis.[24][25] On an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, his daughter Kim stated that the two were briefly engaged.  Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob.[26]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[27][28][29] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment in 1999.[30] Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife, Kris, and their children \"were instrumental\" in the demise of the relationship.[31][32][33] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (n\u00e9e Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[34][17]  See also",

        "generated_text": "Sushi restaurants, supermarkets, and grocery stores are selling mislabeled fish, putting consumers at risk of consuming threatened species and eating habits that can be harmful to their health. According to a recent study, a tenth of fish products sold in 31 sushi bars and restaurants across the UK were not accurately labeled. Additionally, 3.3% of fish sold by supermarkets, which have sophisticated tracing systems, are not what they seem. This percentage is even higher than in independent stores, which sell 1.4% mislabeled fish.\n\nFurthermore, research of grocery shops and markets has found that fish labeled as red snapper, a tropical fish used in Caribbean cooking, was actually redfish, a cold water Atlantic species. Some labeled as mackerel turned out to be either Indian mackerel, which is found in the Red Sea and Polynesia, or hilsa shad, a type of tropical herring mostly found around in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe study's lead author, Professor Stefano Mariani of Salford University, emphasized that this issue is not only about transparency, but also about the environment. He said: \"This is about transparency. People don't know what they are buying. There is now a huge trade in lesser-known species that have not been assessed. We are talking about hundreds of species of fish.\"\n\nThis issue is not limited to the UK, but it has been reported in several countries around the world. In the United States, the Consumer Reports organization has found that a third of the sushi restaurants in the country serve mislabeled fish. In addition, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has reported that overfishing and illegal fishing have led to the decline of many fish species around the world.\n\nThis issue has led to the creation of several initiatives aimed at improving the transparency of the fish trade and protecting the environment. For example, the Sustainable Fishing Partnership (SFP) is a non-profit organization that works to promote sustainable fishing practices and to ensure that consumers know what they are buying. The SFP has a database of over 4,000 fishers and fishing communities around the world, and it provides information on the sustainability of different fish species.\n\nIn conclusion, the mislabeling of fish products in sushi restaurants, supermarkets, and grocery stores is a serious issue that can put consumers' health and the environment at risk. While some efforts have been made to improve transparency and promote sustainable fishing practices, much more needs to be done to protect consumers from harmful and unsustainable seafood products.",

Built in the 19th century, it was acquired by the Sandringham Estate sometime after Queen Victoria purchased the property, and has previously been leased to business owners, civil servants, and members of the British royal family. It is currently the country residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, given to the couple as a wedding gift by Elizabeth II.      Design and location [ edit ]  Anmer Hall, shown with new roof, in October 2014  The Georgian house was built in 1802.[1] It has two storeys and an attic with dormer windows. The long south front comprises 13 bays, and was refaced with red bricks c. 1815. It has 13 ground-floor windows set in blank arches and a semicircular porch on two Tuscan columns, with 11 windows on the first floor. The three central bays are topped by a pediment. The north front is of rubble carrstone and includes four c. 17th-century ogee-headed sashes on the first floor. Renovations c. 1900 added a brick-dressed skin to the north front, together with a projecting entrance porch and a tower towards the eastern end, in the corner formed with a carrstone service wing also added c. 1900.[citation needed] The house was registered as a Grade II* listed building in 1984, but was later de-listed.[2]  Anmer Hall has ten bedrooms.[1] The interior style has been described to be \"a mixture of contemporary designs and well-loved antiques\", decorated with gilt picture frames and houseplants.[3] The walls have been reported to be painted in cream colours, while the dining room is a \"bold jewel green\".[3] The house has an outdoor swimming pool and a tennis court.[3]  The surrounding estate became a scheduled monument in 2003, and includes earthworks marking the sites of buildings from the medieval village of Anmer.[4] The village church, St Mary, lies close to the house, but a short distance away from the modern village. The house is 12 miles (19 kilometres) northeast of King's Lynn, 2 mi (3 km) east of the King's residence at Sandringham and 2 mi (3 km) west of Houghton Hall.[citation needed]  History [ edit ]  Originally the seat of the Coldham family,[5] the Anmer Hall estate was purchased in 1896 at auction for \u00a325,000 by the famed serial fraudster[6] Ernest Terah Hooley before his first bankruptcy. The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII) had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooley's acquisition,[7] and, through an intermediary, Prince Edward requested to purchase the property from Hooley. Hooley agreed, allowing him to buy it at cost in 1898, after which it became part of the Sandringham Estate.[8][5] The reason given was that the Prince wanted the house for the use of his daughter, Princess Maud. A further motivation for the Prince's action was to avoid the possibility of Hooley's business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley, whom the Prince had implicated in the Cleveland Street scandal, from becoming a constant guest on the estate.[8][9][10]  Anmer Hall was leased to John Loader Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby who served as Governor-General of Sudan, and held diplomatic posts in the Colonial Office and Ireland.[citation needed] His daughter, Penelope Aitken, socialised with the royal family and was reportedly walked spaniels around the estate with George V.[citation needed]  From 1972 to 1990, Anmer Hall was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house. It was subsequently rented for the next decade by Hugh van Cutsem, a close friend of King Charles III.[11] During his residency, the house was often visited by Prince William and Prince Harry in their childhood.[11] The house was then leased to the family of James Everett, owner of kitchen timber company, Norfolk Oak.[12]  The Prince and Princess of Wales resided mainly at Anmer Hall with their children between 2015 and 2017  The lease to the Everett family was terminated early following the allocation for Anmer Hall for The Prince and Princess of Wales.[13] The country home was given as a wedding gift to the couple from Elizabeth II.[14][15][16] A \u00a31.5 million refurbishment programme was put in place, paid for by private royal family funds. Renovations included a new roof, new kitchen, the addition of a conservatory, complete internal redecoration; and an extensive tree-planting programme to afford the Duke and Duchess greater privacy.[17][18] The couple also keeps bees to produce honey on the estate.[19]  The then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children moved into Anmer Hall in 2015, and used it as their main residence until 2017.[20][21] It continues to be their private country home, and the family have been reported to spend weekends and school holidays at Anmer.[22][23] William and Catherine's annual Christmas card has featured photographs of the couple outside the home alongside their children.[11][24][25] The family isolated at the residence during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic.[3] A montage video of the family, filmed within the grounds of Anmer Hall, was released to celebrate the Duke and Duchess's tenth wedding anniversary.[26]  See also [ edit ]  Kensington Palace, the official London residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales  Adelaide Cottage, in Windsor, the family residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales  Llwynywermod, a house in Carmarthenshire, Wales, the Prince, and Princess of Wales residence in Wales, owned by the Duchy of Cornwall",

        "doc_1_text": "American attorney and businessman (1944\u20132003)  This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 \u2013 September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life and education  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 22, 1944, one of three children born to Arthur Kardashian (1917\u20132012) and Helen Jean Arakelian Kardashian (1917\u20132008), both Armenian Americans.[1] He had a sister, Barbara Kardashian Freeman, and a brother, Thomas \"Tom\" Kardashian.[2][3] The Kardashians were Armenian Spiritual Christians originally from Kars Oblast, and known by the surname Kardaschoff, a Russianized form of the Armenian surname Kardashian, as the area, though now part of modern-day Turkey, was then part of the Russian Empire.[4] Once in the United States, Arthur's father, Tatos, changed his name to Thomas, and began a career in garbage collection, founding his own business, and married Hamas Shakarian, also an immigrant of Armenian heritage.[citation needed]  He grew up in the affluent View Park area of Los Angeles County, where the family lived at 4908 Valley Ridge Avenue.[5] Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as president and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[13] Simpson was the best man at Kardashian and Kris Houghton's wedding in 1978.  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[14] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[15]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense \"Dream Team\", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[16] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[17]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview with Barbara Walters that he had begun to question Simpson's innocence: \"I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.\"[16] Kardashian and Simpson ultimately stopped speaking to each other.  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at his home in Encino, Los Angeles, at age 59,[18][19] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[20]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016, ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America, produced by Ezra Edelman, in which Kardashian was featured heavily through archive footage.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[21]  Personal life  Kardashian dated Priscilla Presley from 1975 to 1976.[22][23] The pair were introduced by Kardashian's sister-in-law Joan, who had previously been married to Joe Esposito, road manager for Elvis.[24][25] On an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, his daughter Kim stated that the two were briefly engaged.  Kardashian had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob.[26]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin and the widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[27][28][29] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment in 1999.[30] Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife, Kris, and their children \"were instrumental\" in the demise of the relationship.[31][32][33] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (n\u00e9e Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[34][17]  See also",

But tabloids are accusing Meghan Markle of starving herself for the royal wedding, and it's hugely problematic. According to Star, Markle is a \"shadow of her former self,\" and she \"caused a stir\" when she attended an Invictus Games reception with Prince Harry last month because she \"couldn\u2019t hide her frail frame and pin-thin legs.\" Now, the tabloid reported, that she's \"wasting away\" and friends and family are \"fretting\" that she's \"starving herself into emaciation.\"  The fact is that many women work out and change up their diets to feel their healthiest before their nuptials. And this is nothing new. A 2007 Cornell University study found that 70 percent of 272 engaged women said they wanted to lose weight \u2014 typically 20 pounds, according to The New York Times.  In the two months of fittings before most clients\u2019 weddings at Kleinfeld Bridal in New York, for example, one seamstress told The New York Times that she's kept busy taking in gowns. That's because brides-to-be say, \u201cI don\u2019t want the size 16; I want the 14 or the 12,\u2019\" Jennette Kruszka, Kleinfeld\u2019s marketing director, reportedly told the outlet in 2007.  But none of this means that these women are starving themselves.  WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Markle's wedding dress also had to be altered several times due to weight loss, according to The Sun, but that doesn't mean that she has been \"starving herself to emancipation\" either. Rather, the article plainly said, \"Like most brides, Meghan has been on a bit of a health kick.\"  Nonetheless, Star reported that an \"insider\" claims she has \"lost a shocking amount of weight in just the last two weeks\" and that she \"seems obsessed with losing even more before the big day.\" The magazine reported that she \"appears to have dropped 23 pounds,\" and claimed that her purported weight loss is the result of a \"drastic diet\" that consists of cleansing juices and ice chips.  Regardless, eating disorders are no joke, and throwing around accusations about them is totally uncalled for. Anorexia is the third most common chronic disease among young people, after asthma and type 1 diabetes, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Between 0.9 percent and 2 percent of females will develop anorexia in their lifetimes. And, at any given point in time, 1 percent of young women will meet diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa.  And many brides-to-be do indeed suffer from eating disorders. According to Shape, many women get so caught up in losing weight that it becomes unhealthy. A report from Moneyish actually suggested that \"proposal shape\" is the latest fitness trend that encourages people to double down on their usual workout and diet habits so that they'll be \"fit enough\" for the proposal and, eventually, the wedding. Thanks, unrealistic beauty standards!  The actress will marry Prince Harry on Saturday, according to Express, and she may actually be aiming to feel healthy and fit for the important day through a certain exercise, \"royal expert\" Julie Montagu reportedly told the outlet.  Montagu holds the official title of Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, since she married Luke Montagu, Viscount of Hinchingbrooke. She is also a London-based yoga teacher, and she reportedly told Express that Markle has been practicing yoga to get herself ready for the wedding.  Regardless of how Markle chooses to prepare for her wedding day, it's about time we stop body shaming women for both their weight gain and their weight loss. So long as Markle is healthy (and she's got a fianc\u00e9 and a royal family to look out for her there), it's no one's business what size she'll be wearing.",

A surge of water inundated the rural flatland in Bago region after the Swar Chaung dam spillway, which regulates the release of water, collapsed due to heavy seasonal rain.  AFP reporters travelling with a rescue boat described how some people waded out through chest-deep water to get to higher ground while others crammed onto trucks and tractors to reach safety.  Many others remained trapped in their half-submerged homes as soldiers, police, firefighters and volunteers worked into the night to try to ferry residents out.  Khin Myint, 45, told AFP of the terrifying moment when the wave of water hit.  \"The water came so fast into our village and we didn\u00b4t have time to run,\" she said, adding that she and her family were unable to escape from the upstairs of their house because her elderly father was sick.  No casualties have yet been reported but more than 12,600 people have taken shelter in about 30 temporary camps, Ministry of Social Welfare director Phyu Lae Lae Tun said.  \"There are more than 14,000 households and some 63,000 people affected by the waters,\" she said.  The torrent also fractured part of a bridge on the Yangon-Mandalay highway linking Myanmar's two biggest cities.  Deputy Minister for Construction Kyaw Linn told reporters the bridge's supporting towers were sinking.  A section of a bridge damaged by rampaging flood waters  \"We will get divers to go down and check after the water levels recede,\" he said.  Army chief Min Aung Hlaing, under mounting international pressure to face international justice following a damning UN report this week on the Rohingya crisis, was quick to arrive at the scene on Wednesday morning.  \"We have to work together,\" he said. \"The spillway will not be able to be controlled until the water flow stops.\"  The deluge comes just weeks after heavy monsoon rains pummelled Myanmar, causing widespread flash floods that forced some 150,000 people to flee their homes.  Southeast Asia's annual monsoon season runs from around June to November.  Regional neighbour Laos was hit badly last month when heavy rainfall caused the collapse of a dam. At least 35 people were killed, scores went missing and thousands more languished in shelters.  The communist country has since suspended its hydropower strategy to become the \"battery of Asia\" by damming rivers and selling electricity to its neighbours.",

She gained worldwide fame after live videos of her in the late stages of pregnancy and the subsequent birth were uploaded to YouTube in 2017. The birth was watched live by nearly 1.2 million viewers.  Life [ edit ]  April was born in 2000[3] at the Catskill Game Farm in Catskill, New York. She resided at the Catskill Game Farm until it closed in October 2006, when she was relocated to Adirondack Animal Land in Broadalbin, New York.[4]  Animal Adventure Park owned by Jordan Patch acquired 14-year-old April shortly after acquiring Oliver, a 3-year-old male giraffe, in 2015. Oliver and April soon mated, which resulted in her pregnancy that normally lasts 15 months.[5] It was Oliver's first siring and April's fourth pregnancy;[6] she had previously mothered three other giraffes, two males and a female named Autumn, with a male giraffe named Stretch.[2] After becoming pregnant, at Animal Adventure Park she became a \"viral sensation\" in February 2017 while being monitored by a live stream.[7][8][9][10] An estimated 1.2 million viewers watched the live feed of April giving birth on YouTube; the live feed was sponsored by Toys R Us and Babies R Us, as a play on that chain's mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe.[6] By the time the camera was shut off, the YouTube feed had accumulated 232 million views.[11] A GoFundMe fundraiser page that initially set a goal of $50,000 received more than $135,000 by the time the calf was born. The money was used to offset the annual care for the animals and upgrading the giraffe exhibit at the park.[12]  With the prolonged wait for April to enter labor, some people had questioned if the pregnancy was an April Fools' Day joke,[13][14][15] and other conspiracy theories had also been put forward.[16] Prior to the birth, April's veterinarian Dr. Tim Slater stated that despite a great sense of anticipation, the birth of her calf was not considered overdue.[17] On April 8, 2017, April's zookeeper Allysa Swilley and caretaker Corey Dwyer stated that April was big, full of milk and \"closer\" to giving birth, but at this time, the calf is \"just not coming out.\" A live stream of April's pregnancy has been posted to the video-sharing site YouTube. A minor controversy resulted when YouTube briefly removed the stream in late February 2017 following complaints from animal activists of the video allegedly violating standards in regards to nudity and sexual activity. Following thousands of complaints from YouTube users, the stream was restored to the website within an hour.[18]  On April 15, 2017, Animal Adventure Park announced April had gone into labor, noting that the calf's hooves had come out of the womb and that it would take between 30 minutes and two hours from that point to complete the birth. The calf, a male[6] with a height of 5.75 feet (1.75 m) and weighing 129 pounds (59 kg),[19] was born at approximately 9:54 a.m. Eastern Time.[5] The giraffe cam was shut off at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on April 21, with the staff appearing on camera before the shutoff to express their thanks.[11] As a result of a name-the-baby contest, the calf was named Tajiri, from the Swahili language word for \"hope\".[20]  On July 25, 2018, Animal Adventure Park announced that April and Oliver had conceived a second time earlier in the year.[21] This calf, also a male,[22] was born at 12:43 p.m. Eastern Time on March 16, 2019; as with Tajiri's birth, the birth was live-streamed on the Internet, with 300,000 viewers at the time of birth.[23] On March 16, 2019, at 12:43 pm April gave birth to her fourth son, Azizi (Ah-Zee-Zee) weighing 139 pounds with a height of 5 feet and 11 inches. The calf was on his feet at 1:27 pm; and was observed nursing at 1:51 pm.  April was placed on birth control in June 2019 and entered senior care after her handlers observed behavior that made them believe that further calf bearing would be hazardous to her health. During her retirement, she was housed with her two youngest children, Tajiri and Azizi. Subsequently Animal Adventure Park acquired another female giraffe, Johari, to continue breeding of the species with Oliver.[24]  On November 25, 2019, it was announced that Azizi, April's youngest calf, was moving to the East Texas Zoo & Gator Park in Grand Saline, Texas, in spring 2020,[25] because he was growing faster than older brother Tajiri,[26] and also taking to alfalfa hay and a fortified pelleted giraffe diet early on in his development.  The East Texas Zoo and Gator Park announced that Azizi died unexpectedly on October 27, 2020.[27] He had recently received treatment for a parasitic issue; the treatment regimen appeared to be working, and Azizi was showing signs of improvement. On October 27, however, Azizi was unable to stand, and he died during a veterinary examination. Post-mortem review revealed a twisted gut around his cranial mesenteric artery, which was ultimately the cause of his death. This condition was entirely unexpected and unpreventable.[28]  On April 2, 2021, sixteen days before her 21st birthday, Animal Adventure Park announced that April had been euthanized at the age of 20 because of worsening arthritis. She was cremated and her ashes were returned to the park.[29][30]",

Press & Sun-Bulletin  BINGHAMTON, N.Y. \u2014 More than two weeks after its birth, Animal Adventure Park's baby giraffe finally has a name, and it was chosen by someone the calf is very familiar with.  Alyssa Swilley, giraffe keeper at the park, chose the name Tajiri for April the giraffe's calf, who weighed 130 pounds and stood at 5 foot, 9 inches at birth.  Announced on Facebook with park owner Jordan Patch, Swilley was given the opportunity to name the calf based on a voting contest which included an option for \"Alyssa's choice.\"  She chose the name Tajiri.  Related:As April the giraffe's calf grows, so will park they call home  After two rounds and 15 days of public voting, Alyssa's choice beat other picks such as Patches, Unity and Geoffrey, which were nominated for $1 on the park's voting website.  In a Facebook Live video Monday morning, Swilley explained the meaning behind the name and how she arrived at it.  \"Alyssa's choice wasn't just my choice,\" she said. She enlisted keeper Corey Dwyer's help and the two sat down and came to the decision together, she said.  Swilley said Tajiri is a Swahili name for \"hope\" and \"confidence.\"  \"It is a hope for giraffes,\" she said. \"We have been able to give giraffes a voice ... and given the species a hope.\"  Related:1.2 million tune in as April the giraffe finally gives birth  The birth of Tajiri on April 15 was watched by about 1.2 million people on YouTube and nearly 750,000 watched from the zoo\u2019s Facebook page. April the giraffe's pregnancy captivated thousands with people tuning in from around the world to watch the zoo's livestream.  Officials announced previously the money raised from the contest was to be divided between giraffe conservation in the wild, giraffe care at Animal Adventure Park and the park's Ava's Little Heroes annual fundraiser.  Park officials said they'll call the giraffe \"Taj,\" for short.  Once Tajiri can fully eat on its own and is no longer nursing, it will be weaned from April. The process could take anywhere from six to 10 months, to 14 or 15 months, Patch said last month.  At that point, Tajiri will leave Animal Adventure Park.

His fiancee Telli Swift is a reality TV star in her own right and is often seen rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous.  \ud83e\udd4aDEONTAY WILDER VS JOSEPH PARKER : ALL THE DETAILS YOU NEED AHEAD OF THRILLING SAUDI CLASH\ud83e\udd4a  1 Deontay Wilder pictured with his fiancee Telli Swift Credit: Getty - Contributor  Who is Telli Swift?  Telli Swift was born on January 24, 1987, in Zambales, Philippines.  She grew up in Japan and later moved to California.  Her real name is Shuntel, only taking on 'Telli' once she was famous.  She began modelling when she was just three and appeared in a variety of beauty pageants.  When did she meet Deontay Wilder?  The pair met in 2015 and began dating shortly afterwards.  Speaking to The Sun in 2019, Swift said: \" we saw each other from a distance at check-in, then again at TSA, then he finally spoke to me while we were both going to our gates.  \u201cWhile we were talking my friend came - I just got out of the hospital from an infection in my leg which I thought I was going to get amputated if the antibiotics didn\u2019t work.  \u201cI completely stopped talking to him and told my friend what happened with my leg and he left.  \u201cLeave it to Instagram DMs we got in touch with each other two weeks before my family reunion which so happen to be in Alabama where Deontay is from. The rest is history.\u201d  Wilder was initially reluctant to propose over fears that he would get his heart broken again but eventually did so on an episode of Wags Atlanta.  He said: \"I love the girl though. She got my heart. That's my baby, that's my best friend.  \u201cEven though I know I got a real woman and I love her to death, I know that I could give my all to a person and still get f****d over. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not closed-minded about it, because like I said, I found my best friend.\u201d  The proposal, on February 15 2018, was timed to coincide with their child's gender reveal party at which the couple found out they were having a daughter.  The couple are yet to announce their wedding plans.  This will be Wilder's second marriage after his partnership of eight years with Jessica Scales-Wilder eventually broke down in 2017.  When did Deontay Wilder divorce Jessica Scales-Wilder?  Wilder married Jessica Scales in 2009 and proceeded to have four children with her - two sons and two daughters.  Their eldest child, Naieya, has spina bifida, with the boxer often calling her an inspiration as she battles the disability.  The three others are called Ava, Deontay Jr and Dereon.  Wilder reportedly had an affair with Telli Swift, and eventually divorced Jessica in 2017 after eight years of marriage.  Since then, Jessica has kept a low profile, focusing on being a mum to her children.",

The ladies of the reality television show were enjoying a day of sunbathing at sea during a group trip to Cartagena when they suddenly found themselves in hot water, a source told Page Six.  Flames engulfed the engine and the boat started to sink in already turbulent water, leaving the cast panicking, sobbing and even throwing up.  The cast - which includes Dorinda Medley, Bethenny Frankel, Ramona Singer, Carole Radziwill, Tinsley Mortimer and Luann de Lesseps - quickly realized the luxurious day cruise they were put on was actually a decrepit boat.    The Real Housewives of New York City were distraught when their luxurious pleasure cruise through the seas of Colombia went up in flames  The ladies of the reality television show were enjoying a day of sunbathing at sea during a group trip to Cartagena when suddenly they found themselves in hot water, a source told Page Six. Pictured is Ramona Singer, who posted this photo of herself on the boat before heading out to sea, bragging about the magnificent vacation she was taking  Just moments before, the Bravo ladies were excited to spend the day soaking in the sun and having Colombian cocktails with Ramona Singer even posting a photograph to boast about her magnificent trip.  As soon as they started to get things going, the source said everything went wrong, explaining that the boat 'couldn't even move.'  'The anchor got stuck, so the crew had to saw the anchor off before they could sail anywhere,' the source said.  The cruise went from bad to worse when the engine went up in a 'huge blaze.'  'The crew was fighting to put it out,' the source said.  'They didn't have a fire extinguisher nor did they speak English.'  Violent seas meant anything not nailed down started 'flying about' the source said.  And in typical Real Housewife fashion, their response only made matters worse.  But as soon as they started to get things going, the source said everything went wrong, explaining that the boat 'couldn't even move.' Pictured is the area of Cartagena where the women went boating  Bethenny Frankel (left) and Dorinda (center, next to Sonja Morgan) were both soaking wet and 'screaming hysterically,' desperate to get off the boat  Tinsley Mortimer, left with Ramona Singer in July 2017, started throwing up with seasickness because the waters were so rough  Bethenny, Ramona and Dorinda were reportedly soaked from head to toe and 'screaming hysterically.'  Carole and Tinsley started throwing up with seasickness due to the rough seas.  'They all thought they were going to die and they were hysterical,' the source said.  'They were far out to sea and they thought they were going down like the Titanic.'  Eventually a passing boat spotted the ladies in despair and stopped in to rescue the Real Housewives from their watery nightmare.  The women were so distraught by the cruise that Bravo offered them counselling, according to Page Six,  'The Real Housewives of New York City cast was recently on a boat in South America and encountered some turbulence,' a Bravo rep told the paper.  'Thankfully, everyone is fine and was able to continue their vacation as planned.  'The safety of our cast and crew is paramount, and, to that end, we are doing a full investigation.'",

But on Wednesday\u2019s Real Housewives of New Jersey, the mother of four got back to her table-flipping ways when rumors surfaced that she was cheating on her husband Joe Giudice.  As viewers know, Joe is currently away serving a 41-month prison sentence \u2014 giving Teresa an opportunity to find romance with other people, longtime RHONJ guest Kim DePaola claimed. \u201cI hear since Joe went away that she\u2019s rekindling old frames,\u201d she told Housewives Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania while prepping for the fashion show at her fashion boutique, Posche.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a rumor \u2019cause you\u2019re going to find out it\u2019s not,\u201d DePaola added. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Posche on it right now. I think he treated her horribly and I was happy that she\u2019s moving on!\u201d  She may have been certain with her allegations, but Teresa sure found fault with the claims when Flicker and Catania passed them back to her.  \u201cI\u2019m f\u2014\u2014 fuming right now. I\u2019m f\u2014\u2014 fuming,\u201d Teresa, 45, told the duo while at a group dinner with fellow New Jersey Housewives Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs and Friend of the Housewives Danielle Staub.  \u201cShe\u2019s such a f\u2014\u2014 bitch!\u201d Teresa screamed of DePaola, later throwing a glass against the restaurant\u2019s wall behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s not f\u2014\u2014 true! Are you kidding me, it\u2019s not true!\u201d  Paul Zimmerman/Getty  Flicker and Catania sure didn\u2019t believe DePaola when they first heard the claims. \u201cWhat are you talking about right now? Doesn\u2019t matter, \u2019cause you know what rumors are? Just rumors!\u201d Flicker said. \u201cThat\u2019s all rumors. He\u2019s not cheating and there\u2019s no proof of it. Anybody can say anything, unless you have a picture of the wee-wee entering the cookie, who gives a s\u2014? \u2026 People need to mind their own business. This woman has been through hell and back and she\u2019s out there doing events, making money, and working her butt off for her children!\u201d  \u201cKim D\u2019s always been a good friend to me, but spreading rumors about people\u2019s marriages or their children is hitting below the belt,\u201d Flicker told viewers.  Added Catania: \u201cThere aren\u2019t any old flames \u2014 Joe\u2019s the only man she\u2019s ever been with!\u201d  Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images)  Still, when she heard about DePaola\u2019s claims from her friends, Giudice was certain that Catania \u2014 whom she has known for 20 years \u2014 hadn\u2019t had her back. \u201cYou should have f\u2014\u2014 stuck up for me,\u201d Giudice yelled at Catania. \u201c[Siggy] said [she] did, I don\u2019t know if [you] did.\u201d  That accusation pushed Catania off the ledge. \u201cI did! When is enough enough? Huh? When is it a-f\u2014\u2014 \u2019nuff?\u201d Catania asked, bringing up Giudice\u2019s decision to believe Danielle Staub over her in a previous argument. \u201cI stuck up for you. Did you stick up for me against Danielle? I did and you didn\u2019t. I did, and don\u2019t think I will again.\u201d  \u201cWe did stick up for you!\u201d Flicker reinforced. \u201cI yelled, \u2018It\u2019s a rumor and it\u2019s heresy, shut your mouth!\u2019 We said it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d  Marcus Owen/startraksphoto.com  Their words weren\u2019t enough for Giudice and Gorga, who have a long history of feuding with DePaula and were angry that Flicker and Catania were still going to walk in DePaola\u2019s upcoming fashion show \u2014 an event thrown to help raise money for charity.  \u201cThis is so crazy to me. Not only has Kim D done what she\u2019s done for all these years to hurt me and my family, but now on top of it, she\u2019s saying that Teresa\u2019s a cheater. And Siggy and Dolores still are gonna go and support this woman?\u201d Gorga asked viewers. \u201cI\u2019m completely baffled by it. Everything that they say they stand for to me is bulls\u2014.  \u201cYous two are f\u2014\u2014 going and walking in her f\u2014\u2014 show? Are you f\u2014\u2014 kidding me?\u201d Giudice asked.  \u201cDolores, we don\u2019t live in Switzerland. You gotta pick a side. This is your friend. Welcome to New Jersey,\u201d Gorga said. \u201cI have been called a stripper, a whore, I have been told my husband is a piece of s\u2014 and that my children are a piece of s\u2014. Don\u2019t you see what this vile human is?\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: What Advice Would Teresa Giudice Give Herself Before Joining \u2018RHONJ\u2019?  But Catania wasn\u2019t backing down. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d she told Gorga, before walking out with Flicker. \u201cI pity Teresa for not seeing that I am the truest friend that she has. Teresa, guess what \u2014 you\u2019ve been much closer to Kim D than I\u2019ve ever been. Not too long ago, you and Kim D were spreading rumors about Melissa. So now the hypocrites that they are are turning on me. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d  Without them by her side, Giudice decided that she, Gorga, Josephs and Staub were going to go to the Posche show next week and confront DePaola. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that f\u2014\u2014 bitch said that. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re f\u2014\u2014 supporting her after what she did to you, what she did to me. It\u2019s just pretty screwed up,\u201d Giudice said. \u201cI think I need to go there and confront this f\u2014\u2014 bitch.\u201d  Her friends were by her side. \u201cThe line in the sand has been drawn!\u201d Staub said.

So, is Jennifer Lawrence secretly dating Brad Pitt?  \u201cNo, I\u2019ve met him once in like 2013, so it was very random,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I also wasn\u2019t like, in a huge hurry to debunk it.\u201d  Since his separation from Angelina Jolie in September 2016, Brad Pitt has been rumored to be dating everyone from the average Los Angeles civilian to Lawrence, but he\u2019s yet to confirm anything about his personal life.  Lawrence was, however, in an actual relationship with Mother! director Darren Aronofsky. In her Vanity Fair cover story she confirmed that while they may no longer be dating, she still considers him a friend and creative partner.  \u201cWe have an amazing friendship that started before the movie, then we had a partnership with the movie, and then we had a romance that came from the movie, so when you strip the romance away, we still have immense respect for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cAs clich\u00e9 as it sounds, we were good to each other.

        "doc_1_text": "Bethenny Frankel has become persona non grata among her fellow Real Housewives of New York castmates: The other women have had 'enough of her,' sources tell DailyMail.com.  The ill will began when Frankel found herself at odds with Carole Radziwill, 54, who snapped at the 47-year-old: 'Every time we\u2019re together, you\u2019re aggressive with me'.  The other women piled on, leaving Frankel fuming.  She promptly made calls to heads of production and tried to resign from the hit reality show, but was forced to keep filming.  However, her costars wish she was gone, according to production sources.  An insider told DailyMail.com: 'They feel they'd all be better off without her as she's no longer the funny, smart girl next door that everyone liked.  'She's become mean and entitled and she belittles the other women as well as the crew.'  Scroll down for video  Bethenny Frankel, 47, is on the outs with her Real Housewives of New York castmates. Things kicked off when Carole Radziwill, 54, snapped at her: 'Every time we\u2019re together, you\u2019re aggressive with me'. Pictured: The costars in September 2016  When Carole Radziwill told Frankel (pictured last month) that she wanted a break from their friendship, the businesswoman tried to quit the show, but was forced to keep filming  The source continued: 'It all began with Carole calling time on their friendship. She'd had enough of being perceived as Bethenny's puppet and she said enough was enough.  'They had multiple arguments over the period of filming, the worst when they filmed in the Berkshires.  'Carole and Bethenny once did everything together, now Carole wants nothing to do with her.  'Bethenny freaked out and couldn't handle that Carole was calling her out on her BS. Then the other women started telling her they'd had enough.  'This set Bethenny over the edge that she called the heads of production and tried to resign. It didn't work and she was forced to keep filming.'  A source close to Frankel shot back: 'It would take a lot more than Carole Radziwill for Bethenny to resign from the show.'  Both a spokesperson for Bravo and Frankel denied that the petite brunette attempted to quit the show, adding there was 'no truth' to the 'ridiculous' claim.  Production and the cast also grew frustrated with Bethenny slacking off during the season.  A source complained: 'Here is the highest paid cast member constantly saying she is unavailable or too busy and then we see her on yet another vacation or out at her Hamptons home.  'It's beyond frustrating and a slap in the face to the other women who always make themselves available to film - as it is their job!  'She doesn't even do it on the down-low - she blatantly does it without a care in the world. Her Instagram story is an F-U to everyone who is doing their job. Yet when she is called on her behavior she freaks out and can\u2019t take it.'  A source said: 'Carole wants nothing to do with her. Bethenny freaked out and couldn't handle that Carole was calling her out on her BS. Then the other women started telling her they'd had enough.' Pictured: Carole and Bethenny fighting on a promo for the show  The RHONY women piled in on Radziwill's complaints and are reportedly tired of Frankel's 'mean and entitled' attitude  Although Frankel may be on the outs with her fellow costars, she hasn't lost friend Sonja Morgan over the tensions, although the two were on rocky terms themselves just a few years ago.  A source said: 'Only a couple of seasons ago [Bethenny] was ripping [Sonja] apart when Sonja attempted to launch Tipsy Girl prosecco. Bethenny was furious about as it was too close to her Skinny Girl brand.'  Problems for Frankel aren't just limited to her on-camera friends, but behind the scenes as well.  Crew and production members are at their wits end with the reality star.  The production source offered: 'On a trip to Puerto Rico, where she attempts to position herself as the second coming of Mother Teresa, Bethenny was downright mean to the production crew and threatened to have one of the crew members fired for getting lost during production.  'It was shocking how she treated this crew member.  'This person was legitimately lost on an island without power and cell service - and Bethenny lost her mind, screaming at them and threatening to end their career. It was horrible.  'The team behind the show were amused that when the camera was turned on Bethenny was all 'namaste' and charitable and soon as the camera was switched off she'd be yelling at the crew, telling them they couldn't break for lunch and just generally making a difficult trip to a disaster zone even worse.'  Frankel isn't just facing tensions with her costars, but as well as the show's crew. During her relief effort trip to Puerto Rico (pictured), Frankel 'was downright mean', yelled at crew members and denied them their lunch break  They added: 'It was hell. Imagine you lose everything and then Bethenny Frankel shows up with a camera crew. Talk about a nightmare.'  A source close to Bethenny dished: 'She sent over 50 planes in to help with relief as well as raising approximately $50 million. She never even interacted with the crew.  'She was spending her time and efforts trying to help the people of Puerto Rico and running door to door distributing over a million dollars in cash cards.'  The past few months haven't been smooth sailing for the petite brunette.  In February, the RHONY cast, including Frankel, was left traumatized on a hellish cruise through the seas of Colombia.  The boat's engine became engulfed in flames and the craft started to sink in already turbulent water, leaving the cast panicking, sobbing and even throwing up.  A picture - showing Ramona Singer and Dorinda Medley - surfaced of the women looking worse for wear at an airport shortly after, with Singer lounging in a wheelchair.",

A perfect example of NeNe\u2019s hotheaded ways is the not so funny rape joke she made during a stand-up show a few months back.  I think NeNe would be a good spokesperson on a good day, but then again she has a nasty side she can\u2019t always keep in check. Good PR is everything, and NeNe\u2019s antics don\u2019t always make that easy.  Thoughts on this rumor? Do you think NeNe is a hothead?

The source claims that the reality TV star has gained a few extra pounds and is reaching out to companies in hopes of following in the footsteps of Oprah Winfrey and Marie Osmond, but that she is not getting any bites.\n\nThe source also claims that NeNe is a \"hothead\" and that big companies are not interested in taking a chance on her because of her attitude. Additionally, the source notes that NeNe often \"sticks her foot in her mouth\" and has a \"nasty side\" that she struggles to keep in check.\n\nMeanwhile, Bethenny Frankel, a star of the Real Housewives of New York, is reportedly on the outs with her fellow castmates. Sources tell DailyMail.com that the other women have had enough of her and that she has become \"mean and entitled.\" The source claims that Frankel tried to quit the show but was forced to keep filming.\n\nFrankel is also said to be slacking off during the season and is \"beyond frustrating\" to the other women, who are always available to film and consider it their job.

        "doc_1_text": "The ladies of The Real Housewives of New York City have had some epic vacations in the past (see: Scary Island). But Wednesday\u2019s trip to Mexico might just take the cake!  Bethenny Frankel, Ramona Singer, Luann D\u2019Agostino, Sonja Morgan, Carole Radziwill, Dorinda Medley and Tinsley Mortimer left the Big Apple behind for a trip to Puerto Vallarta. While the President\u2019s Day weekend getaway was supposed to bring fun in the sun and a relief from the stresses of life at home, the drama that followed proved to be anything but relaxing.  Here were four of the biggest and most ridiculous moments from an episode that might just go down in history as one of the show\u2019s best.  1. Choosing a room nearly caused World War III.  It\u2019s hard to believe any of the New York Housewivescould find something to complain about with the rooms at the luxurious La Vida Dulce Villa in Banderas Bay. And yet, Singer and Morgan found a way.  The two BFFs, who have a long history of nitpicking over the room they share on vacations, started the conflict right away \u2014 sneaking away from the ladies during a group tour of the complex to stake their claim on the best room.  Frankel wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cThey\u2019re not going and getting their rooms \u2014 it\u2019s not happening. We\u2019re grown women and we\u2019re going to do it fair. We\u2019re not f\u2014\u2014 Gabon animals,\u201d she said, telling Singer and Morgan, \u201cNobody acts like this!\u201d  Though Singer and Morgan tried to claim they had gotten the worst room the last time, their protests were shot down and the group drew numbers out of a bowl determining the order in which they could select their rooms. They ended up drawing the two final slots.  Heidi Gutman/Bravo  That should have been the end of it, but Singer and Morgan wouldn\u2019t go out without a fight.  First, they set their sights out on Mortimer, who had given up her top spot so that Frankel could have the best room. \u201cYou should have given me that room,\u201d Morgan told Mortimer, at the encouragement of Singer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staying at my house for free. You didn\u2019t think of me for one second.\u201d  When that didn\u2019t work, they tried to convince Medley and Radziwill to share the Jack and Jill Suite \u2014 which had four single beds and one joining bathroom (\u201cI want light, I want sun,\u201d Singer shouted. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to f\u2014\u2014 live in the attic\u201d).  But that idea didn\u2019t sit well with Medley, who had given up her room for the duo during their Vermont trip earlier in the season. \u201cStop being a spoiled brat,\u201d she shouted at Singer. \u201cWe\u2019re staying here, and you\u2019re not staying here. I will literally take your s\u2014 and throw it in the pool.\u201d  2. Frankel had zero patience with Singer  Noam Galai/WireImage; Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty  Frankel and Singer made a pact to drop the \u201cnasty\u201d attacks and move on after being at each other\u2019s throats all season long. And while Singer appeared to keep up her end of the bargain in Mexico, Frankel sure did not.  Sick with the flu and at her wit\u2019s end over Singer\u2019s aforementioned room shenanigans, Frankel threw a lot of insults Singer\u2019s way.  Some of the many names she called her included a \u201cgrabber;\u201d a \u201cmiserable, disgusting, grabby twat;\u201d a \u201cvile human being;\u201d an \u201casshole,\u201d a \u201cnasty person;\u201d a \u201croom whore;\u201d a \u201cbully;\u201d \u201cself-serving;\u201d \u201cdisgusting;\u201d \u201cnot a happy person;\u201d and a \u201cmean old lady.\u201d  Singer shrugged off most of the comments \u2014 only telling Frankel that she wasn\u2019t \u201cbeing nasty\u201d when pointing out that the trip was a group trip and not Frankel\u2019s trip. \u201cShe\u2019s not in a good mood,\u201d Singer told D\u2019Agostino. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll make up. I can\u2019t do anything right by Bethenny. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d  3. Tinsley had a breakdown after a gossip site wrote about her and Sonja Morgan  Photograph by Gillian Laub  As a former socialite, Mortimer is used to her name being in the press. But ever since news broke about her April 2016 arrest for trespassing at ex-boyfriend Alexander \u201cNico\u201d Fanjul\u2019s Palm Beach home, the 41-year-old blonde has backed away from the headlines.  So it\u2019s understandable that Mortimer was upset when she got a tip that Page Six was running a piece claiming she\u2019s been an ungrateful houseguest in Morgan\u2019s townhouse, where she\u2019s been living for the past three months. \u201cThis is not what I need right now,\u201d Mortimer told Radziwill. \u201cIt\u2019s making me look like a person I\u2019m not.\u201d  Later at dinner, Mortimer confronted Morgan and Singer \u2014 questioning each about leaking the story to the press. Both ladies played innocent. \u201cPeople talk! I didn\u2019t talk to the press!\u201d said Morgan. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you weren\u2019t ungrateful. I just said you could be inconsiderate. Why would I tell that to the press? Who cares?\u201d  \u201cI avoid the press. I don\u2019t talk to the press. I hate the press!\u201d Singer added, in her defense. \u201cWho gives a s\u2014? It\u2019s not like you killed someone.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: RHONY\u2019s\u2019 Tinsley Mortimer on Moving on After Her Humiliating Arrest and Violent Relationship: \u2018I Still Believe in Love\u2019  Mortimer was still upset though. \u201cI care,\u201d she shouted. \u201cRamona, shut the f\u2014 up. I\u2019m a lovely house guest!\u201d  She then stormed away from the table in tears, screaming: \u201cOh my God! Once again I\u2019m not inconsiderate!  \u201cSonja, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to you right now but you are being so insensitive to me,\u201d she said later. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you. You are a nice person, you are my friend.\u201d  Morgan remained steadfast in her innocence. \u201cI did not do that!\u201d she said. \u201cYou know me better \u2014 you know I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d  4. Luann got drunk and fell down\u2026 twice.  Bravo  Amid all the fighting and drama, D\u2019Agostino appeared to be enjoying the bountiful margaritas being poured. So much so that she found herself on the floor\u2026 twice.  The newly married former Countess is known for being able to hold her alcohol, as Radziwill, Frankel and Singer all pointed out in confessionals during the episode. But the tequila got the best of her Wednesday night \u2014 and into the bushes she went.  \u201cOh my God, Luann, are you okay? You fell in the bushes!\u201d Singer said after her first tumble as D\u2019Agostino was lifted by the Villa\u2019s staff from the shrubbery. \u201cI never saw someone fall like that,\u201d Singer continued to viewers. \u201cLuann out of all of us holds her liquor the best. But tonight, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to her.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: LuAnn De Lesseps had 3 Beautiful Dresses Made For Her Wedding  The second fall happened when D\u2019Agostino went to walk down a step, not realizing it was a ledge. \u201cOh s\u2014\u201d she screamed as she rolled around the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s bad!\u201d  This time, Singer wasn\u2019t as quick to check if her friend was okay. \u201cYou should have gone this way, okay? I\u2019m going this way,\u201d she explained, pointing out the path. \u201cYou went the wrong way. You didn\u2019t see, it\u2019s late at night. There\u2019s no lights and you could have broken your ankle sweetie. Are you okay?\u201d  Luckily D\u2019Agostino was, and retreated home to her room with the help of one of the Villa\u2019s employees. \u201cThis is my tipsy girl,\u201d she joked.

The 19-year-old and her rumored (but, you know, practically confirmed) boyfriend, Travis Scott, showed off their new matching tattoos on Snapchat yesterday, and, though you have to squint to see them, they\u2019re actually kind of cute.  The couple, who sparked dating rumors after they were spotted getting cozy at Coachella in April, tatted tiny butterflies on their ankles in honor of their budding love. The insect might seem random for a til-death-do-us-part-style tat, but those who keep up with the reality star know what butterflies mean to her and her new beau.  For one, it\u2019s the emoji the pair uses when they want to *discreetly* express their love for each other.

Eagle-eyed fans spotted all sorts of butterfly references in the 11-minute long announcement video, and it all seemed very plausible.    There were all sorts of butterflies featured in the video YouTube/ELLE  Except, the theory was actually pretty flawed. Because Kylie Jenner hates butterflies, it turns out. And fans who watched Life of Kylie might remember the episode that proves it.  When Kylie, Victoria and Jordyn took a trip to the London Zoo, they stopped off for a visit at the butterfly exhibit. But it quickly became clear that Kylie was scared shitless of butterflies.  \"It's kind of ironic because I'm terrified...terrified of butterflies,\" she told the camera later. \"This is how I think of them: cut the wings off and if you just look at their bodies, it's not that pretty.\"  Yeah, so that Butterfly/Mariposa name theory wasn't quite as on the mark as we first thought.

In fact, Kylie isn\u2019t sure what they are!  Since Kylie Jenner\u2018s, 20, pregnancy, her relationship with baby daddy Travis Scott, 25, has only gotten more confusing. Still a teenager at the time, Kylie got pregnant super early after she and the rapper got together, and while she hoped he\u2019d step up during her pregnancy, that hasn\u2019t exactly happened. As a result, the youngest Kardashian/Jenner has been left feeling abandoned and \u201cdisappointed.\u201d The worst part? She apparently doesn\u2019t even know what to call her relationship with Travis! Click here to see photos of Kylie since her pregnancy news broke.  \u201cKylie is alone, confused, and worried over her relationship status with Travis,\u201d a source close to Kylie told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThey are currently talking almost daily, and while they are not entirely broken up, they are not exactly together either. Kylie is disappointed because this is not at all how she pictured her pregnancy to end.\u201d The makeup mogul is reportedly due in February and she and Travis are expecting a baby girl. But while this is supposed to be a happy time, Kylie can\u2019t help feeling a little lost \u2014 especially considering her pregnant sister, Khloe Kardashian, 33, has such a rock-solid relationship with HER baby daddy, Tristan Thompson, 26.  \u201c[Kylie and Travis\u2019] relationship is really complicated,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cAs much as Kylie wanted Travis to be with her every step of the way during her pregnancy, she is now no longer clear about what she wants. Kylie feels rejected by some of Travis\u2019 actions and she is determined to raise her baby on her own if he refuses to be a good, present father. She is preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.\u201d  As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, Kylie hasn\u2019t been a fan of Travis\u2019 behavior during her pregnancy, and it\u2019s actually made her quite emotional. \u201cAs Kylie gets closer to her due date, she has been increasingly emotional. Kylie is hit with loneliness late at nights when Travis is not by her side,\u201d another source told us EXCLUSIVELY last month. \u201cShe had such different ideas about what her pregnancy would be like when she learned she would be having Travis\u2019 baby. She thought the pregnancy would bond her and Travis and that he would be by her side every step of the way but that simply has not been the case.\u201d  In fact, it\u2019s apparently gotten so bad that Kim Kardashian\u2018s, 37, husband, Kanye West, 40, has even told Travis he better step up. \u201cKanye had a serious man to man talk with Travis about becoming a father at the Christmas party,\u201d a third source revealed to us EXCLUSIVELY last week. \u201cKanye made it clear to Travis that he needs to step it up big time. Kanye is protective of all of his family and wanted Travis to know that he better not let Kylie down in any way once the baby arrives.\u201d  Tell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Kylie and Travis will last? Do you like seeing them together?",

Now, we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY learned these two fought over her decision to hide her alleged pregnancy from the public!  Travis Scott, 25, nearly had the perfect Thanksgiving. He was missing just one ingredient: Kylie Jenner! The 20-year-old Keeping up with the Kardashians star was invited to join Travis in his hometown of Houston, but she decided to kick it with her family at home (where she would be far from the public eye.) This, needless to say, left Travis with a bad taste in his mouth. \u201cTravis is super supportive of Kylie and obviously wants her to do whatever she needs to do to take the best care of herself but he does wish she\u2019d come out of hiding,\u201d a source close to Travis EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard for him because he wants them to do normal stuff together, instead of just hiding out at her house,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com. The insider brought up that Travis and Cactus Jack Records hosted a turkey drive for Hurricane Harvey relief in downtown Houston on Nov. 23. \u201cHe was begging her to come out and do it with him, but she said no. She doesn\u2019t want to be photographed at all right now. They had a bit of a fight over it. He\u2019s proud of her and wanted her there by his side.

And when Keeping Up With The Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest decided to probe the momager live on TV during an episode of Live With Kelly And Ryan, he got shut down.  As Ryan and co-host Kelly Ripa were discussing the topic of Kylie\u2019s alleged baby bump when he picked up his phone and sent Kris a text as he \u2018had not spoken with the family over the weekend\u2019.  Sorry, this video isn't available any more.  And moments later, he heard back from 61-year-old Kris, who was giving nothing away.  \u2018Kris says Kylie\u2019s not confirming anything,\u2019 he told the audience. \u2018That\u2019s the news from the family this morning. Kylie is not confirming anything.\u2019  Ryan Seacrest has given an update from the Kardashian household (Picture: YouTube)  The head of the Kardashian household had been quizzed on her daughter\u2019s pregnancy rumours at the weekend during Milan fashion week.  She had said at the time that she was \u2018surprised to wake up to the rumours\u2019, adding: \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be the family if something didn\u2019t happen every single day.\u2019  A source close to Kris had also claimed that while Kris was surprise, she will support her youngest daughter \u2018no matter what\u2019.  Kris was at Milan Fashion Week when news broke that Kylie is apparently pregnant (Picture: Pixelformula/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock)  Ryan\u2019s investigative work comes as the news emerges that Kylie is reportedly desperate for Travis to \u2018put a ring on it\u2019 as soon as she\u2019s given birth.  While Kylie, 20, has kept tight lipped about it all so far \u2013 apart from a few teasing Instagram pictures and sources close to her family speaking out \u2013 it\u2019s believed that she\u2019s around five months pregnant and is due to pop in January.  And it looks like she\u2019s getting her life in order quickly as, according to US reports, she\u2019s already planning an \u2018amazing\u2019 wedding to take place as soon as she\u2019s lost her baby weight.  \u2018Kylie wants an amazing wedding and wants to be married as soon as she loses all of her baby weight,\u2019 a source told Hollywood Life.

While representatives for Caitlyn denied that she found out on the internet, as had been reported, they told The Sun that all they could say is that she was told \u2018some time ago\u2019.

We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why Chris is enjoying the feud and anticipating more disses.  The rap war between Pusha T and Drake just got super ugly as the 41-year-old claimed in a new diss track that Drizzy is a deadbeat dad to a secret son with former porn star Sophie Brussaux. Chris Brown is right there with all of us hoping Drake\u2019s got a clap back track coming, but in the meantime he\u2019s pulled up some popcorn and is having a blast watching their drama. \u201cChris is on Team Pusha and believes him when he says that Drake may be ignoring his own baby. Chris is loving all the drama between Pusha and Drake. He is glad that for once, he is not in the middle of this feud,\u201d a source close to the 29-year-old singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  \u201cChris can\u2019t stop laughing at Pusha\u2019s track, from the black face pic to calling Drake a deadbeat, Chris thinks it is all hilarious. Chris feels bad for the baby and thinks Drake is being irresponsible. If the kid really is Drake\u2019s, Chris thinks he should man up quickly and take a more active role in the child\u2019s life. Chris feels if the baby is not Drake\u2019s, then he should probably let that be known pretty quickly too. Chris hopes another diss track is on the way from Drake defending himself either way,\u201d our insider continues. So far, Drake hasn\u2019t responded to Pusha\u2019s claims that he\u2019s got a secret son and is a deadbeat dad. His reps aren\u2019t commenting on the issue either.  Chris is a daddy to his precious daughter Royalty, who just turned four. He can\u2019t understand why if Drake is really a father to son Adonis like Pusha claims, that he isn\u2019t stepping up. \u201cChris believes that Royalty is the best thing that ever happened to him. His daughter has kept him grounded, stable, happy and motivated. He can\u2019t imagine life without her and he can\u2019t think of why Drake would turn his back on his baby too. It\u2019s a huge mistake. Chris feels if Drake denies his own baby then he is missing out on one of the most wonderful things in life, being a father,\u201d our source adds.  But, aside from being a father, why else would Chris be siding with Pusha T? Well if you recall, both he and Drake were romantically linked to Rihanna. While Drake and Rihanna\u2019s romance was never confirmed, Chris\u2019 dramatic relationship with the \u201cUmbrella\u201d singer was pretty high profile. Plus, back in 2012, Drake and Chris were allegedly involved in an altercation that turned violent at WIP nightclub in NYC. And, it was supposedly over Rihanna. Yikes! Can\u2019t we all just get along?!",

        "doc_1_text": "Cardi B is killing it right now. Her new album, Invasion of Privacy, is topping the charts, her songs are insanely popular, and she had a knockout performance at the music festival, Coachella, last weekend. Not to mention, on top of all of this, Cardi B has done all of this while being pregnant. All of the current love surrounding Cardi B has fans dying to know more about her pregnancy. But in case fans were wondering how she ended up with a baby in her belly, during a recent appearance on The Ellen Show, Cardi B showed Ellen DeGeneres how she got pregnant and the results could not be any more hilarious.  It's probably a fact that most Cardi B fans know the answer to the question \"Where do babies come from?\" and are typically the ones being asked that question by younger generations. But people are always curious about the lives of their favorite celebrities \u2014 and although the answer to the question might be obvious, inquisitive minds might want to know how Cardi B got pregnant, like DeGeneres herself.  After performing at Coachella last weekend, Cardi B put on an impressive show, which fans got to see in person and on the Coachella YouTube livestream. While Cardi B's \"suggestive\" dance moves during her set were hardly shocking, according to E! News, the rapper joked with DeGeneres that they were the reason behind her soon to be new addition with her fianc\u00e9, rapper Offset. \"I was just trying to show the world how I got pregnant,\" Cardi B said. \"Like that! Like that! That's how it happened.\"  Watching a video from her Coachella set last weekend gives you a good idea about what she was referring to when she told DeGeneres that her dancing got her pregnant.  Sure, her dance moves might have contributed to her pregnancy but watching her Coachella performance isn't a look behind Cardi B's closed doors with Offset. Still, her performance is worth watching, if only to see how powerful Cardi B is at this stage in her pregnancy. Cardi B has confirmed that she is due in July, according to People, which almost puts her in her third trimester.  Cardi B is going to do this kind of dancing all over again on Sunday, during her repeat performance during Coachella weekend two. And this time, Cardi B is hoping that her dance moves will help speed the baby's arrival along. Cardi B said, during her appearance on The Ellen Show, according to E! News:  They say the more you move, the easier it will come out. You know what I'm sayin'? And I'm like, \"Come out fast!\"  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Cardi B is a little right on that one. There is no scientific backing to prove that dancing or eating spicy foods will help the baby come out faster, according to Women's Health, but research has shown that physical activity was a common labor trigger amongst the majority women who were surveyed in one 2014 study \u2014 and dancing is considered to be physical activity. But unfortunately for Cardi B, it's likely that her upcoming performances will cause her baby to come out sooner than her due date.  Still, that means she will have plenty of time to enjoy her pregnancy before the baby's arrival \u2014 including enjoying those pregnancy cravings. During her appearance on The Ellen Show, Cardi B told DeGeneres that she does indeed have pregnancy cravings, although \"everything depends\" on how she's feeling. \"Like, this whole week I've been eating ice cream, ice cream, ice cream,\" Cardi B said, according to E! News. \"And then, like, I I like, everything lemon-ish.\"  From her cravings to her dance moves, it is clear that Cardi B's pregnancy isn't getting in the way of her doing anything \u2014 including performing at Coachella.",

Despite keeping their relationship under wraps, Rihanna and Hassan have been spotted leaving the same Grammy afterparty separately.\n\nCardi B Pregnancy: Dance Moves and Cravings\n\nCardi B is currently pregnant with her fianc\u00e9, rapper Offset. She recently appeared on The Ellen Show and joked with Ellen DeGeneres that her suggestive dance moves during her Coachella performance were the reason behind her soon-to-be new addition. While Cardi B's dance moves might have contributed to her pregnancy, there is no scientific backing to prove that dancing or eating spicy foods will help the baby come out faster, according to Women's Health. However, research has shown that physical activity was a common labor trigger among women surveyed in one 2014 study, and dancing is considered to be physical activity.\n\nCardi B has confirmed that she is due in July, according to People. While she is excited to dance during her repeat performance during Coachella weekend two, she also admitted that she has pregnancy cravings. \"Like, this whole week I've been eating ice cream, ice cream, ice cream,\" she said during her appearance on The Ellen Show. \"And then, like, I I like, everything lemon-ish.\" While there is no scientific evidence to support Cardi B's dance moves or cravings, she seems to be handling her pregnancy with grace and humor.",

Now that Kylie Jenner is a mom \u2014 she just announced that she gave birth to her first child with her baby daddy Travis Scott \u2014 she definitely had a completely different mindset than most other 20-year-olds. Last June, fans were shocked when Kylie and Travis debuted their new matching butterfly tattoos, but now it all makes sense. She got the butterfly to symbolize her relationship with the father of her baby girl!  What\u2019s more surprising is Kylie got a tattoo of an insect that she\u2019s afraid of!  Over the summer, her show Life of Kylie, has really taught us a lot about the makeup mogul. In a clip from an episode from Season 1, Kylie and her BFF Jordyn Woods went to a zoo together. Too bad Ky learns that she\u2019s terrified of butterflies.  \u201cI\u2019m scared if one lands on me!\u201d the 20-year-old screamed as her friend laughed. Of course, the workers assured her that the butterflies are harmless, but she didn\u2019t care.  \u201cButterflies are just part of the secrets of Kylie,\u201d she said in a voiceover. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just ironic because I\u2019m terrified, terrified of butterflies.

This isn\u2019t the first time the couple has shown their love using the winged insect.

(Photo Credit: YouTube)  Back in June, Life & Style reported that Kylie and Travis may have made their relationship even more permanent by getting married in a super secret ceremony. \u201cKylie and Travis tied the knot at her Calabasas mansion,\u201d a source revealed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big, glamorous affair like other Kardashian weddings, and only a few close friends were invited.

However, neither Kylie nor Travis have responded to Life & Style's report.\n\nMeanwhile, Kylie Jenner has been spotted out and about with two giant, sparkly diamond rings on her ring finger, sparking rumors that she is engaged to Travis Scott. However, the evidence for this is just a picture that the paps snapped while Kylie was out and about with bestie Jordyn Woods on Saturday afternoon. It is also worth noting that Kylie appears to have worn these exact diamond rings before, so it is unclear if she has been engaged for months, or if she is just messing with us, or if she just likes rings. Only time will tell if Kylie and Travis are engaged, or if they are just in a new relationship and happy with their living situation.",

Clearly, the Bronx rapper has a lot going on at the moment, so it's understandable that she might have recently slipped up on something regarding her personal life. As Us Weekly reported, it sounds like Cardi B may have accidentally revealed her baby's sex and she seems so excited about her baby-to-be.  Yes, in case you missed it, the 25-year-old subtly revealed her pregnancy during her performance on Saturday Night Live over the weekend, and fans have been (mostly) encouraging of her happy news. Still, she's been pretty hesitant to reveal too many details about her pregnancy, and with good reason. As many fans as the rapper may have, there are still plenty of haters out there trying bring her down, which is exactly why she kept her pregnancy hidden for so long.  Still, during an appearance on Hot 97\u2019s Ebro in the Morning on Monday, Cardi B was asked a few questions about her life and what she had been up to lately, and she seemed more than happy to answer. When one of the hosts asked if she would ever go host an event at a strip club, she responded simply, \"I was just hosting a strip club, matter of fact. In Miami on Friday.\" But it was what she said a moment later that got people talking.  Specifically, after one of the DJs asked her if she covered up her pregnancy bump during the event, Cardi B started to respond, \"Yeah, she was...\" before she caught herself and trailed off, Us Weekly reported. Additionally, the magazine also reported that Cardi B and her fianc\u00e9e, Offset, do actually \"know the gender of their baby and already have a name picked out.\" So, based off of that tiny little slip, it sure does seem like Cardi B is having a girl.  Also, her sister, Hennessy Carolina, dropped another hint that she's expecting a girl. Over the weekend, she wrote a congratulatory message, which has since been edited, that included, \"give her all the kisses and hugs,\" according to MSN.  Even though plenty of haters have tried to kill her vibe, Cardi B isn't letting any of them get to her. In another radio interview, with Power 105.1's show The Breakfast Club on Tuesday, she revealed that she was getting frustrated with people assuming that her having a baby meant her career was over. \"I see a lot of women online like, 'Oh I feel sorry for you, oh your career is over,'\" she said in the interview, according to People. \"As a woman, why can\u2019t I have both? Why do I gotta choose a career or a baby? Like, why can\u2019t I have both? I want both.\"  Whether Cardi B is having a boy or a girl (but it really sounds like she's expecting a daughter, though, given all of the recent *hints*), she sounds like she's just so thrilled to be starting her own family and becoming a mom soon. In fact, she confirmed that she's due in July, according to People. The rapper also told the publication that she's confident in her fianc\u00e9e's parenting skills. \"And even though, let's say, God forbid we don't [work out], my man is a great father to his kids, so I will never lose. I'm not having a baby with a deadbeat,\" she said, according to People.  Cardi B has been pretty open with her fans in the few days since confirming her exciting news, and perhaps an official sex reveal is on the way. If not, she'll no doubt share that as well when the time is right.  Check out Romper's new video series, Bearing The Motherload, where disagreeing parents from different sides of an issue sit down with a mediator and talk about how to support (and not judge) each other\u2019s parenting perspectives.

Kylie Jenner, 20, is basking in the joy of being a new mother, but when she hears about Wendy Williams, 53, and her constant verbal attacks on her relationship with Travis Scott, 25, it\u2019s hard not to get a bit frustrated. Wendy has stood by her prediction that Travis will eventually leave Kylie and the baby to live the partying lifestyle of a successful rapper. Before baby Stormi Webster was born on February 1, Wendy predicted that Travis would leave Kylie to raise the baby on her own. However, Travis hasn\u2019t done that, and he doesn\u2019t plan to, a source tells HollywoodLife.com.

        "doc_1_text": "Since Kim Kardashian first brought her family into the spotlight, there\u2019s been no shortage of drama when it comes to the Kardashian/Jenner clan. And more recently, fans of Keeping Up With the Kardashians were shocked by the scandals that hit Khloe and her NBA boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. While Khloe went on record as saying Tristan was one of the best men she ever dated, her world was rocked when videos and photos surfaced of him hanging out with other women during their relationship. Not only that, but Khloe was nine months pregnant with his child when the photos came to light.  While Khloe and Tristan seem to be trying to work things out for the good of their daughter, True, it seems fans will never forgive him. Here\u2019s why.  The cheating scandal showed Tristan with several women, not just one  We all have lapses in judgment \u2014 and fans may be more forgiving of Tristan if he had a slip-up with just one woman on one occasion. The footage shared by Daily Mail Online and TMZ showed several occasions of Tristan all over other women during his relationship with Khloe, Cosmopolitan reports. Not only did he fall out of favor with fans when the footage was released, but it has many questioning whether he really has the capacity to change after so much shady behavior.  The first video released by Daily Mail Online showed Tristan kissing another woman in an NYC bar, says Cosmo. And another video showed Tristan cheating on Khloe with two separate women while in a hookah lounge in Washington, D.C. The D.C. footage also allegedly occurred two weeks after Khloe\u2019s pregnancy hit the media, too, making this act extra unforgivable.  Kim doesn\u2019t trust Tristan despite his apologies  If all the Kardashians and Jenners forgave Tristan, perhaps fans would be more willing to give him a second chance. But People notes Kim was questioning Tristan\u2019s sincerity after he showed remorse. On Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kris expressed that she believed Tristan\u2019s apology wholeheartedly, but Kim didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cI told him, \u2018I think you\u2019re more remorseful because it\u2019s affecting your job,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s more embarrassed that he looks stupid, \u2019cause [of] the public \u2026 booing him. And I think it\u2019s more of that than anything, and I told him that.\u201d  Kim did hear him out off camera, however, and she didn\u2019t want to cause any unnecessary tension for Khloe. Even so, Kim\u2019s heart broke when she revealed Khloe really believed in creating a family with Tristan \u2014 and this made fans even angrier.  He also made a nasty gesture to basketball fans  Tristan still can\u2019t seem to catch a break with the media even months after the cheating scandal had been dealt with. People notes at the end of a Cavaliers game he was playing in, video footage from TMZ seemed to show Tristan giving the middle finger to a crowd full of Brooklyn Nets fans after the Nets missed their final three-point shot. He was then serviced with a $15,000 fine for the gesture.  The publication reminds us this isn\u2019t the first time fans saw Tristan get heated on the court, either. He also reportedly had an altercation with Ben Simmons from the Philadelphia \u201976ers (who was rumored to be dating Kendall Jenner at the time). The two NBA players had to be separated \u2014 and it certainly didn\u2019t help Tristan\u2019s standing with the Kardashian family or Khloe fans.  Are Khloe and Tristan still together? Fans think they\u2019ve secretly broken up  Since the birth of True, Khloe has been totally tight-lipped about her relationship with Tristan. And while it\u2019s assumed they\u2019re still together and making things work for the good of their child, Cosmopolitan notes some fans think they could be secretly broken up.  As for why fans think Khloe\u2019s single, her Instagram posts are a big clue. She hasn\u2019t posted any recent photos of her and Tristan together, and she\u2019s been posting emotional messages of love and encouragement to her fans that are also a big concern. Not only that, but she seems to only refer to Tristan as \u201cTrue\u2019s dad\u201d instead of her boyfriend.  If Khloe and Tristan are broken up, many fans would rejoice and hope Khloe can finally find the man she deserves. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what the future holds.

Now, rumors are circulating that Khloe has been banned from attending Cleveland Cavaliers games.  According to a May 23 report by Gossip Cop, Khloe Kardashian has not been forbidden from attending Tristan Thompson\u2019s basketball games at home in Cleveland. The rumor originated from a report by Media Take Out. The site claimed that LeBron James specifically asked Tristan to keep Khloe away from Quicken Loans Arena on game days.  \u201c\u2018Lebron James asked Tristan to ban the Kardashian from all remaining playoff games,\u2019 insisted the website. The outlet maintained the prohibition applied to the NBA finals as well. The online publication cited unspecified \u201creports\u201d as the basis for its contentions, but a Google search indicated the claims originated with MTO. In fact, when lemmings like HollywoodLife also spread these allegations, they credited MediaTakeOut as the source. But none of the sites that copied the misinformation bothered to fact-check or do any investigating,\u201d Gossip Cop reports.  However, Khloe Kardashian herself seemed to debunk the rumors when she showed up at the Cleveland Cavaliers game with her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, to cheer on her baby daddy. Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time that Khloe has allegedly been banned from the team\u2019s games.

During an interview with BuzzFeed on Friday, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was asked about what she\u2019s looking forward to the most about being in her 20\u2019s.  The reality star turned 20-years-old just one day before.  She claimed, \u201cProbably turning 21. I feel like that\u2019s fun. You know, I\u2019ve never had a drink before so I just wanna know what it\u2019s like.\u201d  Something tells us she\u2019s fibbing here.

Her fans responded on Twitter and Instagram, but they seemed to be paying more attention to arguing whether Rihanna was pregnant or just thick than to her musical success, as the Inquisitr reported. While social media was debating Rihanna\u2019s rumored baby bump, the songstress was celebrating at 1Oak Nightclub in New York City with her rumored billionaire beau, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, according to People.  Hassan and Rihanna kept the party going until after 3 a.m. at the club. The 29-year-old singer stunned in her third outfit of the evening, glittering in a gold crop top and gold jewelry. Rihanna received her award at the Grammys for Best Rap/Sung Performance for her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar.  Although the songstress was immersed in celebrating with Jameel after the Grammys, she also reportedly became aware of the rumors soaring on Twitter and Instagram about her alleged pregnancy. An insider told Hollywood Life that Rihanna had an unexpected reaction to the reports that she was sporting a baby bump rather than flaunting thicker curves during her Grammy Awards performance. And part of the songstress\u2019 reported reaction involved her beau.  The pregnancy speculation began after Rihanna flaunted her curvy body as she danced during her \u201cWild Thoughts\u201d performance at the Grammys. The songstress didn\u2019t try to hide her thicker figure, according to the source, but she reportedly didn\u2019t anticipate that she would face baby rumors.  \u201cSome fans jumped to the conclusion that the 29-year-old was pregnant after her tight costume showed a little belly bump.\u201d  Rather than go public with denial of a baby bump, Rihanna is just laughing off the pregnancy claims and trying to ignore them, said the insider. She reportedly is not pregnant and not even trying to have a baby.  Rihanna Happy With Thick Curves, Talks Hassan As Baby Daddy  The source also revealed how Rihanna and her boyfriend feel about her thicker curves.  \u201cRihanna\u2019s been happy with her thicker look, and her billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel loves her curves.\u201d  In addition to trying to laugh off and ignore the pregnancy rumors, however, Rihanna reportedly brought Jameel into the baby bump discussion. According to the insider, the songstress revealed that she does want children and believes that Hassan will be a fabulous father. Rihanna isn\u2019t ready right now to have children, but she reportedly is eager to welcome one or more babies into her life with her beau.  \u201cShe\u2019s simply not ready to start a family\u2026 just yet,\u201d clarified the insider.  Rihanna Caught Canoodling With Jameel  The source revealed that Rihanna thinks Jameel is the perfect partner for having children together, describing him as \u201ckind and patient, and a loving person.\u201d And while Rihanna anticipates that Hassan will become a terrific daddy to her children, the insider said that the songstress will be a great mother.  \u201cRihanna loves children\u2026 She\u2019s a natural mom, and she thinks Hassan will make an amazing father.\u201d  For now, however, Rihanna reportedly is focused on her career rather than starting a family. The insider revealed that Rihanna hasn\u2019t even met her future baby daddy\u2019s family yet, and fans should be aware in the future that when they see her belly protruding, it\u2019s probably a \u201cfood baby\u201d rather than a pregnancy.  Rihanna and Jameel have been a couple since June. They were seen kissing in Spain during her vacation, dining at a restaurant in London in September, and visiting Boston in October. For Halloween, Rihanna and Jameel enjoyed dinner, bowling, and \u201ccanoodling all night,\u201d an insider told People.  An heir to the Abdul Latif Jameel business dynasty of Saudi Arabia, which has the right to sell Toyota Motor vehicles in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, Hassan works as the head of a charitable group in the company, Community Jameel. Rumors soared last month that Rihanna and Jameel were engaged when she was seen wearing an enormous diamond. But an insider told People that the couple is not yet engaged.",

She\u2019s talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.  Around the time of True\u2019s birth, Khloe\u2019s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?  A post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  It\u2019s safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she\u2019s been trying again with Tristan?  A source has said, \u201cKhloe loved being pregnant, but she\u2019s the first to say how great she feels now that she\u2019s lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.\u201d  Even so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, \u201cthey\u2019ve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It\u2019s basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.\u201d  The source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. \u201cHe\u2019s been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn\u2019t changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she\u2019s not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan\u2018s a convincing guy,\u201d the source revealed.  Is that enough to convince Khloe to try to get pregnant again? After giving birth, women have to wait six weeks before they can have sex again and the couple is well past that date.  But don\u2019t get too excite because Khloe herself revealed that she\u2019s not quite ready. A fan recently asked if she was having another baby:  Not right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol https://t.co/TthrxOQdHr \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018  Keep in mind that she just went back to work, and is in the process of fixing her relationship with Tristan. Would she really be in the right state of mind to welcome another child into the world?  While she may wait a while, there\u2019s no doubt that she loves being a mom. We just hope she gets her house in order before expanding her family any further.  A post shared by Top Media New Zealand.

In a now deleted Snapchat, RiRi is seen walking around the party, playing with the kids in a ball pit and laughing with friends. Drake was also caught on video hanging out and enjoying the day. The one thing that didn't happen is any interaction between the two \u2013 publicly at least. To be honest, we're not totally surprised. What would YOU do if you ran into an ex at an intimate gathering? Probably the same thing these two did and that is avoid each other at all costs.  RELATED: Drake Admits That He Still Loves Rihanna  The Shade Room posted a few seconds of the footage with the caption, \"#PressPlay #Rihanna and #Drake were spotted at a kids party today! They arrived separately, Riri came with her bestie. Drake looks like he was caught off guard ??.\"  Rihanna and Drake have known each other for a long time and he's professed his love for the songstress more than once. Most notably at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards when the \"One Dance\" singer presented Rihanna with the Video Vanguard Award. There was speculation that these two were dating at the time. After the show, they were seen getting dinner alone.  However, things reportedly fizzled out and no one really knows what went down between them. In August, a source told E! News, \"Rihanna and Drake are seeing other people at the moment. They are not exclusive anymore. They still love each other, but their schedules have gotten in the way. Anything can change between them though, for better or worse. They are still in each other's lives.\"  RELATED: Drake Reveals the Most Unexpected Birthday Surprise  Since then, Drake has been romantically linked to India Love and Jennifer Lopez while Rihanna has stayed publicly single. Clearly, things have changed between them considering how little time they spent together at the birthday bash.  No one is quite sure what their status is and if they even acknowledged each other at the gathering. However, we do know that these two are just living their lives exactly like they want at the moment. Both focusing on their careers, friends and family. Because there is so much history between them, we have a feeling these two will be seen hanging out together sooner rather than later. But this birthday party definitely wasn't the place to do that.

Find out exact dates here & why she hopes baby comes that week!  Khloe Kardashian, 33, is reportedly expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, 26, and she\u2019s rumored to be about five months along in her pregnancy, putting her due date somewhere in February. More specifically though, she\u2019s apparently due in MID February, and she\u2019s hoping her baby\u2019s birthdate falls during NBA All-Star Weekend. Why? Because that way, Tristan, who plays basketball for the Cleveland Cavaliers, doesn\u2019t have to miss out on any court time. Click here to see adorable pics of Khloe with her nieces and nephews.  But while Tristan will have a nice chunk of time off during All-Star Weekend, he\u2019s also made sure he\u2019ll be able to take a short break when baby Thompson arrives \u2014 no matter WHEN it happens. \u201cTristan will be given a few days off from the Cavs when Khloe goes into labor, and everyone is actually hoping it occurs during the NBA All-Star break so he doesn\u2019t miss any time on the court,\u201d a source close to the Cavs revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cBut one thing that is good, is that the All-Star Game is actually in LA this season. So things may work out perfectly, at least that is what everyone is hoping for. But regardless, he has already got it covered if the baby comes before or after.\u201d  NBA All-Star Weekend will be held from February 16th-19th next year, and, conveniently, it\u2019ll take place in LA at the Staples Center. So no matter what ends up happening with Khloe and the baby, Tristan has a plan in place. The Cavs\u2019 last game before All-Star Weekend is an away game on Feb. 13, and their first game once All-Star Weekend has ended is a home game on Feb. 22. So it looks like Khloe\u2019s due date falls in between the the 16th and the 19th, but anytime in February is also fair game.  In preparation of their tiny addition, Tristan, who resides on the East Coast, is looking to buy a home in LA, according to TMZ. While the athlete was previously after a temporary home in LA, since Khloe\u2019s pregnancy news, he wants something much more permanent in order to be close to Khloe and their future child, the media outlet reported. Tristan is reportedly set on Bel Air, Beverly Hills, or the Hollywood Hills, and has a budget of around $20 million. Looks like Tristan truly is trying to make sure everything is in place for when his second child arrives!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Tristan and Khloe are having a baby boy or girl?",

Of course, you don't necessarily need to have a date to have fun \u2014 some of the best prom moments might happen with your BFFs. But imagine what everyone would think if you showed up to prom with one of the biggest celebrities...perhaps someone like Kylie Jenner?  One high school student did just that. Albert Ochoa was a junior at Rio Americano High School last year when he attended his prom with the reality star and her best friend Jordyn Woods. Photos and videos from the dance quickly went viral this spring when others on the Internet caught wind of the event. And considering Kylie never went to her own prom, it definitely seemed like a night to remember for the celeb as well.  So how exactly does one end up taking Kylie Jenner to prom, you might ask? We chatted with Albert to find out how it all went down. It turns out that he might have his peers to thank for the best night ever because they put up posters advertising that he needed a date to the event. According to Albert, Kylie took notice on Twitter and reached out to the teen to see if she could be his date.  Albert tells Teen Vogue that the rest of his classmates were \"shocked\" to see him show up with Kylie on his arm. \"After prom, everyone wanted to be my friend. I never expected so much attention in one night,\" he says.  But the \"attention\" definitely didn't stop at prom, considering clips from the event aired during the first episode of Kylie's TV show, Life With Kylie. \"It was little overwhelming at first,\" Albert says of going viral and appearing on TV. \"But...it's exciting to talk to people all over the world!\" The teen credits his date with Kylie for giving him the confidence boost that he needed, although he notes that he hasn't talked to the reality star since the big dance. \"It would be nice to hear from her!\" he says hopefully.",

Braided Weft hair extensions are sewn into your natural hair which is braided to cover your whole head and the wefts of hair are sewn in to the braided rows. Those with thin hair usually do not have enough hair to make the small braid to hold the hair extension.  It is important to consider how much weight, stress and tension is placed on your natural hair by the hair extensions. For fine or thin hair, you should look for the lightest density for hair extensions.  It may seem that strand by strand application would be the lightest weight in applying extensions to your hair. But you must consider the potential damage to your hair that can be caused by bonding individual pieces of hair to natural thin hair.  With tape in hair extensions, the extensions are light weight and require no glue, tools or fusion type of bond to stay in your hair. With the single method application, the extension is bonded with a piece of tape rather than sandwiching two extensions together. By doing so, the weight is reduced by half which is best for causing the least amount of strain and possible damage to thin hair.

For the most natural, non-damaging hair extension method for thin hair, you should consider the tape in hair extension option to add volume and length to thin hair.

While we don\u2019t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise\u2014not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.  Stone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009\u2019s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she\u2019s often thought of as a redhead, she\u2019s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she\u2019s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we\u2019ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she\u2019ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once.

        "doc_1_text": "There's nothing worse than spending tons of time meticulously curling your hair before an event, only to end up with frizzy curls, weird pieces sticking out, an embarrassingly outdated style, or worse...limp locks because your curls didn't even last half an hour. Luckily, we've compiled a list of curling iron errors to avoid so you can achieve gorgeous waves this summer.  Mistake: Not Prepping Your Hair  In order to get a good curl, you need to prep your hair first. \"It's like building a house,\" says celebrity hairstylist Patrick Melville. \"You have to create a good foundation for it to hold.\" To do this, first use a heat-protecting product (it's essential to prevent damage), then blow-dry your hair completely. This will close the cuticle and help hold your curls, as well as avoid heat damage from using the iron on damp hair. Melville also suggests using a styling glaze pre-ironing (he likes Hantz Professional Styling Glaze, $10 hantzprofessional.com) for control and texture. Also, if you know your hair has a really hard time holding a curl, go ahead and mist your hair with a little hairspray before you use the iron.  Mistake: Curling Your Hair in the Wrong Direction  Make your desired part before you start curling, as this will help determine which way you curl the hair. For a more natural look, you'll want to curl your hair away from your face. This means winding the hair down and around the wand of the curling iron in a clockwise direction on the right side of your face and a counter-clockwise direction on the left side.  This is the right way to curl your hair:  \u200b  \u200b  Mistake: Twirling the Iron Instead of Your Hair  Most women clip their ends into the iron, then twist the iron in toward their head. According to Melville, this will give you more of a barrel curl (think Shirley Temple) or flip (think Farrah Fawcett), rather than the more natural-looking wave you were probably going for. To achieve that, hold the iron so the barrel (the hot part) is facing down toward the floor, then wrap your hair around it, starting from the roots and locking your ends in last. This will not only make your curls last longer, but it will also give you more volume at the roots. Also, make sure you don't twist the hair at all before winding it around the barrel, as this will prevent the heat from distributing evenly on the hair. Think of your hair as a ribbon, and lay it flat over the curling iron as you wind.  Mistake: Using an Iron That's Too Large  You might own four different-sized curling irons, thinking you need each one to achieve a range of tighter or looser curls. The truth is, you really only need one. \"You can do a lot more with a one-inch barrel than you can do with a larger one,\" says Melville. \"It's more universal. If you want a looser wave, just take a slightly larger section of hair.\"  Mistake: Curling Too Much Hair at a Time  While taking a slightly larger section of hair may provide you with a looser wave, curling too much hair at a time isn't a good idea, either, says Melville. You won't get an even distribution of heat throughout that section, which can cause your curls to do a disappearing act. For the most natural look, wrap small sections of hair around the barrel of your iron using the technique described above (and make sure the sections aren't all exactly the same size\u2014your curls will look more natural this way).  Mistake: Buying a Curling Iron That's on Clearance  If you curl your hair frequently, you should invest in a good iron with a ceramic barrel. Also, there's a difference between spring hinge irons and marcel irons with a swivel handle. Even though it might take some getting used to, Melville recommends going for a marcel iron because the clip on a spring can cause unwanted creases in your curls. The marcel iron can also stand in for those wand-like curling irons with no clip at all\u2014just wind your hair around the iron and hold it by the ends. Melville recommends leaving the ends out of the iron completely to get a more natural \"undone\" look.  Mistake: Holding Your Hair in the Iron Too Long  Obvious alert: Curling irons are hot. Some irons can reach up to 450\u00b0F, which can cause some serious damage, depending on your hair's condition and texture. Melville recommends using a low or medium setting on finer, more fragile hair and leaving your hair wrapped around it for no more than two to three seconds. You can use the hottest setting if your hair is strong, coarse, and thick, but be careful not to leave it on any longer than you need to.  Mistake: Touching Your Hair Right Away  Always allow your hair to cool down for a couple of minutes so the curl has a chance to set. Touching or running your fingers through your curls immediately after curling it can cause unwanted frizz or make your curls droop. After that waiting period, you can help keep your style in place by spraying your curls and your hands with a finishing spray (Melville recommends Osis Session Finish Hairspray, $19 ulta.com) and crunching the ends. To get a more natural, slightly messy curl, break up your finished curls with your fingers at this point. Alternatively, you can brush them lightly for a smoother wave. This will also help you distribute product evenly throughout your strands.  Finally, make sure to remember that many curly styles can be created by using variations on these techniques. If you have a specific look in mind that you want to try, ask your stylist to show you how to recreate it the next time you visit the salon. They'll appreciate the chance to give you a tutorial, and you'll get a hairstyle that works with your specific cut and texture.",

        "doc_1_text": "Tuesday, April 11, 2017 by  The basic act of curling hair is pretty simple \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to wrap hair around a curling iron or up into hot rollers. It\u2019s what you do with those curls afterwards that becomes difficult. Molding spirals of hair into the look you want, whether it\u2019s casual waves, spunky beach waves, or big, loose curls can feel totally overwhelming. I can give myself curls pretty easily, but personally, I really struggle with the whole voluminous curly hair look. I can\u2019t seem to get the volume required, and I also can\u2019t seem to manage to make my curls loose enough. It\u2019s a serious hair struggle.  Unfortunately, big, loose curls are also my favorite type of curls. Long, cascading hair (like Victoria\u2019s Secret waves, as the look is commonly known) has always been my preferred style. I love how glamorous yet simple they look, and I love that they can make anything you\u2019re wearing seem just a little more chic. But, like I said, these curls are not as effortless as they seem \u2013 they require time and, yes, effort. The good news? It\u2019s definitely not impossible to figure out the formula. The below tutorials for big, loose curls are easy, and can be done by even the most basic of beginners. I promise! Check \u2019em out for your new signature style, or for something more fancy. Whatever it is, you won\u2019t be disappointed!  1. Use a large curling iron or wand to create larger curls.  Source  A large wand, like 1.5 to 2 inches, will automatically create larger curls (unless you have short hair, in which case, it won\u2019t really do anything but create a wave). The smaller the wand, the tighter the curl, so start off with the right tools to make things easier.  2. If your hair is naturally wavy, try doing heatless curls.  Source  Wrapping your damp hair around something, like a rolled up shirt, then sleeping on it, will create curls and tons of volume (especially this high on your head). Wrap larger sections of hair to ensure larger curls; again, smaller wraps of hair will create tighter, smaller curls. This works best if your hair is naturally wavy \u2013 if it\u2019s naturally stick straight, it will only create a kink or a wave.  3. Roll your hair into rollers on top of your head.  Source  Hair rollers can be difficult to get down, but they definitely give a ton of volume. Roll hair into the rollers directly on top of your head for a big look.  4. For something fast, put your hair in a ponytail, then curl the hair in the ponytail.  Source  To create fast curls, first put your hair into a high ponytail. This makes it a lot easier to manage and also creates some lift because it keeps you from curling too close to the roots. Curling close to the roots means the curls usually won\u2019t be as large and loose.  5. Gently brush out your curls.  Source  If you have a smaller wand, or your hair holds onto a curl very tightly (like mine), gently brush your curls out when you\u2019re done. Curl them, then use hair spray to set, and then use a large brush and softly brush the curls until they are as loose as you want them.  6. Curl away from your face to create more of a loose look.  Source  Changing the direction of the wand can make a big difference. So can setting the curls \u2013 when you\u2019re done curling, hold them up with your hand for a few seconds so that, even after brushing, they don\u2019t lose too much shape.  7. Use hot rollers to create a slightly more vintage feel.  Source  Use mousse and texturizing spray before using hot rollers to create more of a look. These things will help hold the curls and give you a more relaxed vibe.  8. Lightly curl pieces of your hair, then roll it into rollers and wait.  Source  There\u2019s no rule that says you can only use either rollers or a wand! Try curling sections of your hair with the wand, then wrapping them into rollers to be extra sure the curl holds.  9. Tease your hair before curling for extra volume.  Source  Part of having big curls is having a lot of volume. One fast way to achieve that is by teasing your hair \u2013 back brush with a comb until you get a lot of frizzy volume. As you apply product and style with heat tools, that frizzy look will disappear and you\u2019ll be left with lots of volume.  10. Go for the vintage look by shaping curls into retro waves.  Source  Use a small comb to mold your curls into a vintage shape.  11. If you have naturally wavy hair, put it into a bun to create heatless curls.  Source  This isn\u2019t just wrapping hair into a messy bun \u2013 you\u2019re looping strands around each other, then letting them sit for glamorous curls and lots of volume.  12. Brush the curls out with your fingers.  Source  You don\u2019t need a brush to get looser curls \u2013 simply run your fingers through them for the same effect!  13. Use different techniques with different pieces for a loose, casual feel.  Source  Play around with different curling techniques throughout the styling process. For one strand, keep things normal, and for the next, twist it and then wrap it around. The different kinds of curls look more natural and loose.  14. Twist and pinch your curls for a more loose look.  Source  The lesson here? Don\u2019t just curl hair and then leave it! Play around with the finished curls to make them less tight.  15. Pin your curls on top of your head for extra volume.  Source  Don\u2019t have rollers? No problem. Use a bobby pin to gently roll up curls and pin them to hold the shape but also give extra bounce.  16. If you have natural hair, try a twist out.  Source  This technique can make your curls look shinier and more defined, yet still on the looser side.  Which one of these hairstyles is your favorite? How do you get big, loose curls?

        "doc_1_text": "Some tasks seem straightforward until you do them. For example, many people don\u2019t know how to blow dry their hair so it looks like the work of a professional stylist, which of course, is totally understandable. You may not realize it, but there\u2019s so much more to the task than simply grabbing a dryer, pointing it at your head, and blasting your hair with heat. In fact, getting a gorgeous at-home blowout requires using the right products, keeping your hair healthy, and getting a little bit of practice.  Here, we asked top stylists and a dermatologist for their tips on how to blow dry your hair at home.  1. Invest in a great blow-dryer if you can.  If you have the budget, you may want to invest in a tool that offers functions to minimize hair damage and help cut down on your drying time. For example, some dryers offer features like multiple heat settings, a cool shot to close hair cuticles, and ionic air technology. Celebrity hair stylist Jennifer Yepez recommends the T3 Cura Luxe ($200, T3) and the Dyson Supersonic ($430, Nordstrom) if you want to purchase a more expensive dryer. But there are plenty of more affordable stylist-recommended options, like the Red by Kiss 2200 Ceramic Tourmaline Dryer ($31, Amazon), if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money. (You can find more recommendations here).  2. Start by air or towel drying your hair.  Keeping your hair healthy will help you avoid dry ends, resulting in shinier blowouts. And one of the best ways you can do this is by minimizing the amount of heat you apply to your hair, says Shilpi Khetarpal, M.D., dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic. She recommends towel drying or air drying your hair to remove as much moisture as possible. \u201cIn general, the dryer your hair is the less heat you have to use,\u201d Dr. Khetarpal says.  3. Dry your hair using the right kind of towel.  \u201cUsing a heavy, bulky bath towel creates a lot of weight and tension in our hair, and that can make it more likely to break or shed,\u201d Dr. Khetarpal says. She recommends drying your hair using a small microfiber towel, which not only reduces tension but also decreases friction. The result? You\u2019ll have fewer flyaways and less frizz, she says. One of our editors loves the Aquis Lisse Luxe Hair Turban ($50, Sephora), which transforms her hair from soaking wet hair to slightly damp in just five minutes.  4. Avoid using a brush on wet hair.  Please don\u2019t reach for that round brush when your hair is soaked, Dr. Khetarpal says. Tugging on wet hair with a brush increases your chances of damaging it. Instead, try this tip Dr. Khetarpal often gives people: Use a wide-tooth comb to easily detangle hair when it is still wet. If you skip this step, then your brush is more likely to get caught on knots, which will rip out more hair\u2014even when it\u2019s dry. \u201cThat\u2019s just unnecessary stress on the hair,\u201d Dr. Khetarpal says. The Diane Ionic Anti-Static 6\u201d Volume Detangler Comb is a good choice and can work on thick or curly hair ($4, Ulta). (This Felicia Leatherwood Detangler Brush is one of our favorites, ($22, Felicia Leatherwood.) If you don\u2019t like combs, brushes made with softer bristles, like the Wet Brush ($9, Amazon), work well too. The Felicia Leatherwood Detangler Brush with widely spaced, flexible teeth is another one of our favorites, ($22, Felicia Leatherwood).  Dr. Khetarpal recommends that people with long hair hold it in their hands and lightly comb the ends before moving up toward the roots. This is gentler on your roots and can help you avoid hair breakage.  5. Pick the right brush for your hair type.  You should pick a brush based on the results you\u2019re looking for and your hair type, says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad\u2019s creative director. Typically, stylists like using a round brush to create a voluminous, bouncy style. Then, you have to decide on the material of the bristles. Vaccaro advises his clients with straight hair to use ceramic brushes because they retain heat to offer more volume. He prefers using boar-bristle brushes on people with coarse hair because the material provides the right amount of tension needed to smooth their strands.    Yepez favors brushes with ceramic-coated barrels, such as the T3 Volume 2.5 Round Professional Ceramic-coated Brush ($35, Sephora) because the material retains heat and dries your hair faster. Otherwise, she recommends the YS Park G Series Curl Shine Styler Round Brush ($51, Amazon) for most people. \u201cThe bristles are specially made to help with faster drying and less heat damage,\u201d she says.  6. Always use a heat protectant.  Yes, heat protectants work, and you should be as diligent about using them as you hopefully are with your SPF, says Dr. Khetarpal. \u201cThink of it as sunscreen for your hair,\u201d she explains. There are a variety of products that you can use on either wet or dry hair, so read the bottle to understand how to use it. For example, if you\u2019re going to use a spray before blow drying, then you should make sure it\u2019s formulated to be used on wet hair, Dr. Khetarpal says. (Some products are meant to be used with other hot tools, like a curling iron, on already dried hair.)  7. Remember to apply styling products evenly through your hair.  \u201cWhen some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,\u201d Yepez tells SELF. \u201cSometimes you just forget the back of your hair.\u201d  She advises parting your hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can apply the product using either your fingers or a comb, Yepez says.  8. Use your blow-dryer attachments.  You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don\u2019t ignore it. Blow drying with the diffuser on is less traumatic for your hair, Dr. Khetarpal says.",

        "doc_1_text": "3 Ways Diffusing Can Cause Heat Damage on Natural Hair  Generally when naturals think of heat damage, they think of flat irons and curling irons being the culprits. Unfortunately, heat damage doesn\u2019t stop at those styling tools. Diffusing your hair can cause heat damage as well. If you\u2019re a wash n go gal who diffuses daily, then you may want to consider laying off the diffuser. Natural hair guru Naptural85 recently cut off quite a bit of hair due to diffusing and coloring. She broke down her experience in this YouTube video.  Whitney admitted that her excessive diffusing (in addition to coloring) lead to her heat damage. Additionally, she explains that pulling down her hair for length while diffusing, caused a lot of heat damage in the back of her head. While she may have had fun with her hair, it wasn\u2019t worth the headache in the end. Whitney is now on a journey to get back the length she lost, plus some. She plans on regaining the length lost by doing less wash and go\u2019s and more twist outs.  This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to give up diffusing completely, but it does mean that you have to be more careful. Here are 3 ways diffusing can cause heat damage.  Lingering Heat  Although diffusing is least likely to cause heat damage, it\u2019s still attached to a blow dryer. Naturals often shy away from blow dryers because they blow heat directly onto the hair and zap moisture very quickly. Even though the diffuser doesn\u2019t have the same effect, it can still cause damage if it is left on a section of hair for too long. Move it around and let the air from the dryer distribute evenly.  High Heat  This sounds like a no-brainer, but for some it isn\u2019t. When diffusing, don\u2019t place the heat setting on high. Some naturals can handle the high heat at full force and never experience visible damage, but everyone\u2019s hair is different. Just like flat irons and curling irons, high heat on a blow dryer can cause severe heat damage, even if it\u2019s through a diffuser.  Diffusing Daily  Diffusing too often is another way to damage your hair. I\u2019ve noticed a big difference in the health of hair from naturals who diffuse once every three or four days. However, if you must diffuse daily, use a warm or cool setting.  What are some of your tips for preventing heat damage when diffusing?",

But the 43-year-old added makeup can be a powerful game changer.  \"The tiniest little bit of concealer and a lip can make such a difference in your self confidence that it's like, you do it and you think, 'Why would I never not do this?' But I'm a mom, I'm busy and we forget to put a little bit into ourselves. Even one minute, 30 seconds can just sort of boost yourself, and it's important to remember to take that time to do that,\" Barrymore said.  As for the planned reboot of Charlie's Angels, set to be directed by Elizabeth Banks and rumored to star Kristen Stewart and Lupita Nyong'o, Barrymore was supportive of the idea.  \"I'm just excited for them,\" the Santa Clarita Diet star said. \"Because every generation that brings Charlie's Angels out into the world is about the power of three women and what they can do, while loving men and wanting to date them or working side by side with them. But there's just something about Charlie's Angels that make men and women so happy.\"  \"And it's so positive. So if they keep that alive in this new iteration, it's just going to be great,\" she added.  For more on Barrymore, watch the video below!  RELATED CONTENT:",

        "doc_1_text": "I get it: Sometimes you want loose, undone waves, but whipping out your curling iron just feels a little extra (see also: time-consuming, hard, annoying...). But what if I told you you could create the perfect beach waves with a flat iron? Not only is it way easier than curling your hair, IMO, but it\u2019s also a genius way to get just-rolled-out-of-bed waves \u00e0 la Emily Ratajkowski or Lucy Hale without having to attend beauty school or watch, IDK, 30 hours of YouTube to master. Ahead, I gathered seven game-changing hacks that\u2019ll immediately turn you into a hair-straightener convert.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #1: Add Texture  Got fine hair that doesn\u2019t hold a curl, or silky-soft texture with zero grip? Whether you\u2019re working with freshly washed hair or you\u2019re going on day three, prep for flat-iron beach waves with a healthy spray of dry shampoo. And as with any heat styling, you\u2019ll want to follow with a few spritzes of heat protectant to keep your hair nice and healthy. These top-rated formulas are a great place to start:  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #2: Create \"S\" Waves    Kathleen Kamphausen/Lauren Ahn  If you\u2019re after soft, lived-in waves (basically, the opposite of bouncy, Victoria\u2019s Secret-esque curls), you\u2019ll love this flat-iron technique. Start by picking up a section of your hair and dropping it (yup, drop it\u2014bear with me) into the mouth of the flat iron to create your first bend. Then, with that same section, clamp your flat iron in the shape of an \u201cS\u201d to finish off the piece. You\u2019ll repeat this motion throughout your hair, focusing on your ends for a natural-looking finish.  Not sure your hair-straightener is up to the task? Check out one of my personal faves, below:  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #3: Twirl and Pull  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  For beachy waves that are slightly more defined, try the twirl-and-pull method. Holding your flat iron at an angle, insert an inch-wide section of hair between the clamps and turn the iron away from your face to create your first bend. Then, gently slide the iron a little way down the section of hair before twirling the iron away from your face again. You\u2019ll repeat this method until you reach your ends\u2014leave them relatively straight for an unfinished (yet cool) look. Once your entire head is done, run your fingers through the loose curls to make them more wave-like.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #4: Twist Away from Your Face  Kathleen Kamphausen/Lauren Ahn  This technique is especially great for longer hair, since you can actually get a fairly bouncy wave out of it. Using a , feed a 1-inch section of hair (starting close to the nape of your neck, eventually working up toward your hairline) between the clamps. From there, in one fluid motion\u2014or else you\u2019ll end up with crimps\u2014twist your wrist away from your face so the hair flows over (not under) the iron. Make sure the hair continues to wrap around the flat iron\u2019s shell as you pass through your ends. Pro tip: The smaller the section, the curlier your hair will be.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #5: Bend Your Wrist  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  Not super down for a time-consuming technique? This quick hack of simply bending your wrist back and forth will give you subtle beach waves. You\u2019ll want to hold your hair out horizontally from your head and turn your wrist away as you pass through the section, then bend your wrist back toward your hair for some soft texture.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #6: Start with a Braid  Kathleen Kamphausen  An equally low-effort technique, this hack begins with a super-simple braid. After spritzing your braid with a , gently run the flat iron over it a few times. When you undo your braid, you\u2019ll be left with perfectly crimped beach waves.    Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #7: Protect Your Waves with Pin Curls  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  If you\u2019re going to take the time to create flat-iron waves, you may as well make sure they last overnight (nobody wants to restyle their hair in the morning, am I right?). Before bed, roll 1-inch sections of your waves into loose pin curls, securing with a few bobby pins. When you wake up, gently remove the and let your waves down.

The Twittersphere went into overdrive after Vanessa Hudgens posted an Instagram photo on Sunday and fans were quick to notice that the actress, who is in a relationship with actor Austin Butler, was wearing a big ring on that finger.  But it turns out that sometimes a ring on a ring finger is just a convenient place to place your baubles after an exhausting day on set.  On Tuesday, Vanessa took to Twitter to clarify the Internet sleuths' find and explain the sitch: \"Guysssss. I\u2019m not engaged! I posted a pic. Not to show off my ring that I happened to throw on that finger after a long day of filming but to show off my haircut Lol.\"  Oh oops! Cute haircut, V-Hudge!",
        "generated_text": "Vanessa Hudgens recently sparked engagement rumors after posting an Instagram photo showing off a big ring on her ring finger. However, the actress quickly clarified the situation on Twitter, explaining that the ring was simply placed on her finger after a long day of filming and was not an engagement ring.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick and easy way to achieve beachy waves without spending hours at the beauty salon or watching endless YouTube videos, consider trying out flat iron beach waves. Not only is this technique easier and faster than traditional curling or waving, but it also allows you to achieve the perfect wave without the need for special tools or styling products.\n\nHere are seven hacks to help you achieve the perfect flat iron beach waves:\n\n1. Add Texture: Prep your hair with dry shampoo and heat protectant before styling with a flat iron. Use a small section of hair at a time and bend it into an \"S\" shape while holding the iron in place. Repeat this process throughout your hair for a natural-looking finish.\n2.

Twist Away from Your Face: This technique is especially great for longer hair, since you can actually get a fairly bouncy wave out of it.

I have always loved her music, her vibe and her approach\u2026she's in your fucking face. She was a star from the first moment she gave us the one-two punch of her verse on Kanye's \u201cMonster\" and her debut album, Pink Friday. She's appeared on every track that we know and love, and has collaborated with just about everyone cool. Funny fact, an image of Nicki sitting with Anna Wintour at New York Fashion Week (a gift to me from photographer Patrick McMullan) has been a centerpiece of my art collection in my home. Nicki has been on my mind for years.  We have never called an issue Break the Internet since we did it back in 2014 with Kim Kardashian. It takes a certain type of talent, with an awesome fan base and the ability to put trust in PAPER to work our magic. I have always loved all of the looks that Nicki has done (and she has done them all). Her style (typically anchored by her off-the-charts hair choices) matches her musical talent perfectly. Break the Internet is all about the big idea, the word, the image. It came to me one day that 'Minaj \u00e0 trois' had never been done. HOW? We have seen different versions of Nicki, from high fashion to seductive to in-your-face and eye-catching all at the same time. But we had never seen all of these together -- and now we have the chance, thanks to our cover shoot with the rap star and Ellen von Unwerth. Welcome to Break the Internet.  Stay tuned for the rest of the cover story, which launches tomorrow (Wednesday, November 15th) afternoon -- we promise it won't disappoint.

Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says.  However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015.  WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus  Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline.    2013:    According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013.  Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took \"work.\" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss.  One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC.  \"He definitely looked interested in her,\" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar.  Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015.  Affleck and Shookus \"full-on had an affair,\" claims a source cited by People. \"They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide.\"  \"Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,\" claims a second source the magazine quotes. \"Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,\" the source alleges.  X17online.com  According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. \"[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,\" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet.    2015:    According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015.  \"They were devastated when they found out about the affair,\" a source claims according to the magazine.  However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, \"Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems.\"    June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate    Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015.  \"After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,\" the two said in their joint statement to ET. \"We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.\"    July 2015 -- The nanny scandal      Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny.  Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands.  Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that \"all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue\" and that they are considering legal options. \"The story is complete garbage and full of lies,\" his rep stated.    April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce    Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority.  Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction.  \"I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,\" he wrote in his statement on Facebook.    July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus    Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles.  A source tells ET that Affleck's new relationship works \"really well,\" because Shookus \"has had experience with the Hollywood world.\"  \"[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly,\" the source explains. \"It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private.\"  Another source also tells ET that much like Affleck and Garner, Shookus and her ex -- whom she married in 2010 -- are also \"extremely amicable.\"    \"They live separately but are extremely amicable,\" the source says of Miller and Shookus, who met during Shookus' first day at SNL in 2002. \"They split a while ago. They realized that they were stronger as friends.\"  \"It's not uncommon, even now, to see them together getting coffee in the building, talking in the hallways, grabbing lunch, visiting each other on different floors,\" the source claims, adding that the pair are such good friends that Miller -- now a supervising producer on Late Night With Seth Meyers -- knew Shookus was dating Affleck before news broke of the relationship.  WATCH: EXCLUSIVE -- Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Split From Husband 'A While Ago,' Source Says  Meanwhile, the source describes Shookus as \"an extremely nice, normal person.\" As for her relationship with Affleck, the source shares \"they are just enjoying each other's company right now.\"  Watch the video below for more on Affleck and Shookus' relationship.    -- Reporting by Jen Peros  ",

If this description of Affleck is close to accurate, he could be the Oscar-winning, movie star version of \u201cBachelor\u201d star Arie Luyendyk Jr., who angered Bachelor Nation and the rest of America by vacillating between two women in the show\u2019s final episodes.  For her part, Garner really tried to make things work with Affleck \u2014 despite his reported struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling and monogamy, according to Us Weekly.  This fall, Affleck also had a dark cloud hanging over him following news about multiple sexual misconduct allegations against his regular producing collaborator Harvey Weinstein. In the wake of the Weinstein allegations and the launch of the #MeToo movement, Affleck was accused of groping two women and of being complicit in a Hollywood culture that allows sexually predatory men to stay in power.  After Garner and Affleck first announced their split in 2015, the \u201cAlias\u201d actress \u201cput her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children\u2019s sake as well as theirs,\u201d a source told Us Weekly.  \u201cShe forgave him for so much, and still he couldn\u2019t change,\u201d the source said.

Affleck and Shookus also were spotted house-hunting together in the Los Angeles area over Valentine\u2019s Day, various reports said.

The new Us Weekly report claims that there was a slim chance that the two could have reconciled in late 2017, after Affleck returned to rehab and re-dedicated himself to his recovery.  According to reports in November, two-time rehab veteran Affleck realized he was \u201closing his grip on his alcohol addiction.\u201d  Affleck poured out his heart to Garner, \u201ctelling her everything that was going on with his life,\u201d a source told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cAfter everything they\u2019ve been through, she is going to continue to be there for him when he needs her,\u201d the source told Us Weekly in November. \u201cNo matter what the circumstances.\u201d  Those circumstances include all the \u201csmoking and drinking and gambling\u201d that apparently took place during the marriage \u2014 as well as Affleck possibly cheating on Garner with Shookus when they were married and reportedly dating their children\u2019s 28-year-old nanny Christine Ouzounian after they first announced their split in 2015.  The new Us Weekly report said that Garner visited her estranged husband every day while he was in rehab.  \u201cThey did family counseling to work on their relationship,\u201d an insider told the magazine. \u201cThings looked positive. Jennifer was very caring, very present. They both wanted it to work.\u201d  But another source told Us Weekly that Affleck is, in fact, ready to move on and be with Shookus, whom he \u201cloves and adores.\u201d  Certainly, geography could make that relationship challenging as Shookus lives in New York City, where she works and raises a son, while Affleck is committed to being close to his children, who are based in Los Angeles.  The website Gossip Cop quoted other sources \u201cclose\u201d to the couple who slammed the Us Weekly report, saying that the story actually makes clear that the two aren\u2019t reuniting, but teases the idea that they might. A contact close to the situation told Gossip Cop: \u201c(The cover) is not true. There\u2019s no reconciliation and they are in (the middle of) finalizing the divorce.\u201d  Another friend of Affleck and Garner told Gossip Cop that the exes are \u201cboth working hard to create the best relationship for the kids.\u201d  Indeed, the Us Weekly story said that Garner has quietly begun dating again, though that included going out with a man who is described as looking something like Affleck.  \u201cJen is ready to go with her feelings and give love another try,\u201d a friend told Us Weekly.  This story has been updated.",
        "generated_text": "In 2015, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their separation after ten years of marriage. However, they have yet to finalize their divorce, leaving fans to wonder what is taking so long. A new report by Us Weekly claims that Affleck is dragging his feet because he would like to get back together with Garner, with whom he has three children. If this is accurate, Affleck could be the latest example of a celebrity who vacillates between two women, much like Bachelor star Arie Luyendyk Jr. Despite his struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling, and monogamy, Garner tried to make things work with Affleck, but he couldn't change. After filing for divorce in 2016, Affleck has been spotted with his new girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, and sources say he has begged Garner to come back several times. However, Garner remains supportive of Affleck's recovery from alcohol addiction and is willing to continue being there for him and their children. Despite the ongoing divorce proceedings, Affleck and Garner have continued to be seen in public together, attending church or taking their children to school.",

(Mike Coppola/Getty Images)  Reporter  This past year, the viewing public has seen a myriad of images of Ben Affleck: In February, looking \u201csmitten\u201d while taking a walk with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus. In March, gazing into the ocean off Hawaii, displaying his much-mocked back tattoo. In August, pausing at a fast food drive-through window with a Playboy model, amid headlines that he and Shookus had split.  And then Wednesday night, a miserable-looking Affleck in the back seat of a car driven by his equally unhappy-looking estranged wife, Jennifer Garner. TMZ, People, Us Weekly, and E! reported that Garner was taking him to rehab to receive treatment for alcohol addiction. (Affleck\u2019s publicist did not return a request for comment.) This comes after more bleak pictures of Affleck, who did a second stint in rehab last year, accepting an apparent liquor delivery at his home this week.  [Ben Affleck knows you mocked his giant back tattoo, but he\u2019s doing \u2018just fine\u2019]  On one hand, it\u2019s surprising to see such drama between two A-listers play out so publicly: While paparazzi are crafty, there are presumably many ways for stars to conduct their private business away from the cameras. And yet both Affleck and Garner seem uniquely aware of the power of public image \u2014 which for many celebrities is just as important than their actual career.    Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner attend a gala in New York in 2014. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)  Affleck\u2019s zigzag trajectory as an actor and director has always moved in parallel to his relationships. As he broke out with \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d and \u201cArmageddon\u201d in the late 1990s, he hooked up with Gwyneth Paltrow, fresh off her Oscar for \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d His bombs like \u201cGigli\u201d and disappointments like \u201cDaredevil\u201d in the early 2000s coincided with his becoming a tabloid punchline as one half of Bennifer, in a frenzied, much-discussed relationship with Jennifer Lopez.  When he wed Garner in 2005, it ushered in a new era. Suddenly, they were the golden couple with the adorable children \u2014 spotted all over Los Angeles, on ice cream runs and playing in the park \u2014 and Affleck started to earn acclaim again for smaller roles (\u201cHollywoodland,\u201d \u201cState of Play\u201d) and directing movies such as \u201cThe Town.\u201d In 2012, he directed the Oscar-winning \u201cArgo.\u201d  Thus the question that was raised when Affleck and Garner separated in June 2015: What happens to your career when the star-powered marriage that helped propel it is over? Garner, 46, brilliantly continued to cement her narrative as a wholesome, protective mom to her three children. She has starred in family-friendly films such as \u201cMiracles from Heaven\u201d and \u201cNine Lives\u201d while targeting critical acclaim with HBO\u2019s upcoming comedy \u201cCamping.\u201d Her popular Instagram account is filled with goofy videos of reading books to her dog; filming episodes for her \u201cPretend Cooking Show\u201d; or promoting her organic baby food company, Once Upon a Farm.  It\u2019s a stark contrast to Affleck\u2019s ups and downs over the last three years. \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d made him millions, though his performance as Batman drew scorn. \u201cSad Affleck\u201d became a meme after his wistful expression when an interviewer asked about about the lousy reviews. This past fall, his press tour for \u201cJustice League\u201d kept turning into discussions about sexual harassment, as he was asked about \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d producer Harvey Weinstein. And as the #MeToo movement picked up steam, he apologized for his on-air groping of a young MTV host, Hilarie Burton, in 2003.  Affleck also made for some more positive headlines, via his relationship with Shookus, a well-liked \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer. Despite speculation about when exactly their relationship started, they became a tabloid-favorite couple, frequently snapped walking their dogs or shopping or hiking; the Cut catalogued 47 times they were photographed getting iced coffee. Affleck may have just been trying to live his best life as a 46-year-old separated dad \u2014 but at this point, he was clearly savvy enough to know that fans find inexplicable joy in seeing celebrities go about their mundane activities happily.  Throughout their split, Affleck and Garner have been open about co-parenting and trying to keep life as normal as possible for their kids. They give friendly interviews about each other. Two months after Garner filed for divorce in spring 2017, the family went on vacation to the Caribbean together.  So it raised some eyebrows last month when TMZ\u2019s The Blast revealed the couple has still not officially divorced; the court has threatened to dismiss the case \u201cfor delay in prosecution.\u201d A source \u201cexclusively\u201d told Us Weekly that it was because Garner has concerns about Affleck\u2019s sobriety and how it could affect their kids. Then over the past week, it emerged that Affleck and Shookus had broken up; and he was photographed with Shauna Sexton, the young Playboy model who, as multiple articles made sure to point out, has been quoted as saying that she loves drinking whiskey.  Now, as Affleck is reportedly headed back to rehab, observers once again have a front-row seat.

        "generated_text": "Ben Affleck, a former star of Hollywood, has been making headlines for his personal life in recent times. In 2016, reports emerged that he was taking his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, to rehab for alcohol addiction. The couple, who have three children together, separated in 2015. Despite the separation, Affleck and Garner have been open about co-parenting and trying to keep their children's lives as normal as possible.\n\nAfter the separation, Affleck's career began to fluctuate. He received millions from his role in \"Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" but his performance as Batman was met with scorn. He also made headlines for his relationship with Saturday Night Live producer, Lindsay Shookus. Despite speculation about the exact start of their relationship, they became a tabloid favorite and frequently appeared in photographs together. However, the couple recently announced that they had broken up.\n\nAffleck's personal life has been closely followed by the public, raising questions about how a star's personal life affects their career. While paparazzi are crafty, stars have presumably many ways to conduct their private business away from the cameras. However, Affleck and Garner both seem uniquely aware of the power of public image, which is just as important as their actual career.\n\nAffleck's career trajectory has always moved in parallel to his relationships. He broke out with \"Good Will Hunting\" and \"Armageddon\" in the late 1990s, but his bombs like \"Gigli\" and \"Daredevil\" in the early 2000s coincided with his becoming a tabloid punchline. When he married Garner in 2005, they were the golden couple with the adorable children, but Affleck started to earn acclaim again for smaller roles and directing movies such as \"The Town.\" In 2012, he directed the Oscar-winning \"Argo.\"\n\nWhen Affleck and Garner separated in June 2015, the question that was raised was what happens to your career when the star-powered marriage that helped propel it is over. Garner, 46, brilliantly continued to cement her narrative as a wholesome, protective mom to her three children. She has starred in family-friendly films such as \"Miracles from Heaven\" and \"Nine Lives\" while targeting critical acclaim with HBO's upcoming comedy \"Camping.\" Her popular Instagram account is filled with goofy videos of reading books to her dog; filming episodes for her \"Pretend Cooking Show\"; or promoting her organic baby food company, Once Upon a Farm.\n\nAffleck, on the other hand, has experienced ups and downs over the last three years. \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" made him millions, though his performance as Batman drew scorn. \"Sad Affleck\" became a meme after his wistful expression when an interviewer asked about the lousy reviews. This past fall, his press tour for \"Justice League\" kept turning into discussions about sexual harassment, as he was asked about \"Good Will Hunting\" producer Harvey Weinstein. And as the #MeToo movement picked up steam, he apologized for his on-air groping of a young MTV host, Hilarie Burton, in 2003. Despite these challenges, Affleck may have just been trying to live his best life as a 46-year-old separated dad - but at this point, he was clearly savvy enough to know that fans find inexplicable joy in seeing celebrities go about their mundane activities happily.",

Lindsay Shookus, his current girlfriend, doesn\u2019t see their friendliness as a good thing as OK! has exclusively reported that she gave him an ultimatum about their relationship during a dramatic showdown in Hawaii recently.  Article continues below advertisement  An insider claimed that Lindsay started to feel unsettled about their year-long relationship after she heard of a secret sleepover in early March between Ben and Jen at the California home they once shared with their children Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Lindsay, who has a 5-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, \u201cunderstands that Ben needs to be there for his children,\u201d says the source, \u201cbut she found it strange that he went to the marital home and spent the night.\u201d  Even though she tried to brush off his overnight stay, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that \u201cevery time things seem to be going well, something happens to remind her that Jen and the kids come first,\u201d according to the source.

        "doc_1_text": "It looks like Lindsay Shookus listened to that popular saying about how \u201clooking good is the best revenge.\u201d  That\u2019s because Shookus, fresh off her breakup from Ben Affleck, donned a spectacular, plunging black evening gown Monday night to get up on stage at the 2018 Emmy Awards. \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which she produces, had just been honored for outstanding variety sketch series.  Shookus, 38, later posed, smiling with her trophy, with her blond hair pulled up in a messy updo.  The image offers up a contrast to a report that she\u2019s \u201cdevasted\u201d by her breakup last month from Affleck. The breakup was announced the same week that Affleck was photographed in the company of 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton, followed by video of his ex-wife Jennifer Garner driving him up to Malibu to check into rehab for his ongoing struggles with alcohol addiction.  But in addition to joining Lorne Michaels and the rest of her \u201cSNL\u201d crew to pick up some Emmys, Shookus has apparently found other ways to cope with separating herself from Affleck\u2019s high-profile personal challenges.  Vanity Fair writer Josh Duboff said on his \u201cIn the Limelight\u201d podcast that Shookus was spotted on a date Sept. 8 at the U.S. Open women\u2019s final. A source emailed Duboff to say that Shookus was seen with an unidentified man, holding hands, and hustling to leave the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City after the match between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka.  Shookus, wearing a khaki jacket, white jeans, sneakers and sunglasses, \u201cseemed concerned she was going to be spotted,\u201d the source told Duboff. \u201cAt least that\u2019s how she framed it to her affectionate date, who held hands tightly with her as they rushed out a side entrance.\u201d  If both Shookus and Affleck, 46, have moved on with new romances, they\u2019re both enjoying pretty quick rebounds, given that they looked like they were getting pretty serious.  They dated publicly for year but it\u2019s been reported that their romance went back to 2013 or 2014 when Affleck was still married to Garner, the mother of his three children.  But maybe things were never that serious between them. There have been various accounts offered for why things didn\u2019t work out, including Affleck\u2019s acknowledged drinking problems.  But it\u2019s also possible he was never \u201cfully committed\u201d to Shookus, according to People. Or maybe Garner found it hard to accept Shookus being around their three children. There also were reports that Affleck and Shookus, who are based on opposite coasts and are each parents to young children, simply couldn\u2019t find time to be together.  In any case, Affleck hasn\u2019t been letting what should be an intensive recovery program at The Canyon in Malibu interfere with his budding relationship with Sexton. While he stays the nights at the Malibu facility, he enjoys daily trips back to his Pacific Palisades home to work out with trainers. He also has been spending time with Sexton at his mansion, and the model has been seen visiting The Canyon and driving around Los Angeles in his SUV.  A source told Entertainment Tonight that Affleck has been told to hold off starting a new relationship while he is so early in his recovery program. But he\u2019s not listening.  \u201cHis closest friends hoped he was just dating her and would break it off after going to rehab, but he seems to get closer to her every day,\u201d a source said. \u201cThe more time Ben seems to spend with Shauna, the more he seems to want to go home.\u201d  For Shookus, hearing about Sexton becoming Affleck\u2019s new female companion hasn\u2019t been easy, the source told Entertainment Tonight.  \u201cLindsay was supporting Ben in the beginning but now he seems to be relying more on Shauna than Lindsay and she is devastated,\u201d the source said.  \u201cShe believed he would get sober and they would work it out, but that isn\u2019t how things seem to be panning out,\u201d the source added.",

In a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the 46-year-old actress says intense tabloid scrutiny -- specifically, stories regarding her highly publicized marriage and eventual split from Ben Affleck -- put pressure on her private life.  Garner recalls a time when there were as many as 15 to 20 cars parked outside her home on the weekends, looking for any information they could dig up on her and her family.  \"Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it,\" says Garner, who shares three kids, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9 and Samuel, 6, with Affleck. \"I really -- I could cry talking about it.\"  \"What I think I've learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen,\" she continues. \"You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, 'cause you think that\u2019ll end the, 'Are they engaged?

Recently, Affleck drew flak when he publicly condemned Harvey Weinstein regarding the allegations of his longtime sexual misconduct against women. Affleck called his colleague's actions unacceptable, but many Twitter users crudely reminded him that he was no better with his sketchy past. When a user brought up Hilarie Burton's accusation that Affleck groped her on camera on TRL in 2003, others began sharing the video of the incident, making it go viral.  The actor soon released a statement, saying that he was sincerely asking for Ms. Burton's forgiveness after he acted inappropriately towards her. The controversy did not die down, though. Makeup artist Annamarie Tendler revealed that the actor inappropriately touched her during a Golden Globes party in 2014 and was also asking for a public apology. A televised interview of Affleck flirting with Canadian TV host Anne-Marie Losique also went viral. She said, though, that nothing \"improper\" happened even though she was sitting on the actor's lap.  Amidst all the hoopla, Garner has kept her silence, preferring to stay out of the limelight and focus on their kids. The couple previously announced their separation in June 2015. Affleck, however, continued to live on the same property as Garner to co-parent their three children: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5. Last Halloween, they went trick-or-treating with the kids in Malibu. They were photographed accompanying the little ones while collecting candies in the neighborhood.  E! News reports, though, that Garner is actually very annoyed with the whole situation. The actress is allegedly doing her best to show their children that everything is all right, but she is frustrated with her ex-husband.  \"[She] is very annoyed because it just means more attention on her and the kids as a result of Ben's actions,\" a source claimed. \"She tries to shield them from any and all publicity and scrutiny. She's taking her kids to school and to all of their activities. As far as they know nothing has changed and all is well. That is always her goal but she's been pretty frustrated with him.\"",

Wearing his usual jeans-and-shirt ensemble, Ben Affleck took Lindsay Shokus, who was wearing a striped top and a thigh-skimming denim shorts, shopping earlier that day.  Speaking to E! News, a witness confirmed that the 45-year-old Oscar winner paused his stroll with his girlfriend to sign autographs and have selfies taken with fans who happen to pass them by before they proceeded to Barney\u2019s New York. After that, they made their way back to Ben\u2019s hotel.

One month prior, the 38-year-old Saturday Night Live producer opened up to Elle magazine about the scrutiny their relationship faced after his split from Jennifer Garner following 10 years of marriage.  \"It\u2019s strange to me,\" Shookus said of her newfound notoriety. \u201cMy entire career has been behind the camera, and that\u2019s definitely where I\u2019m most comfortable. I\u2019m a producer, I\u2019m a mom, a friend. Being considered a public figure honestly makes me laugh.\"  Meanwhile, Affleck and Garner are still legally married. The two announced their separation in 2015, and filed for divorce last April. But earlier this month, ET learned that a judge in the L.A. County Superior Court sent a document to the actress informing her that the final judgment has not been filed and entered. According to the court document, it's her third notice of case review, and if she fails to take action fast, the court will dismiss the case for delay in prosecution.  Affleck and Garner share three children together -- Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6 -- and clearly still remain on good terms. In June, Garner Instagrammed a sweet Father's Day post dedicated to Affleck, praising him for being a great dad.

They\u2019re amicable.\" The news comes after Affleck was spotted multiple times with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton, sparking rumors of a new romance. However, another source close to Sexton revealed that Affleck and Sexton are currently \"having fun, it\u2019s light,\" and have only recently met.\n\nShookus, 38, has since deleted her Instagram account.

And in fairness, they really did seem to move rather quickly from the very beginning.  Of course, there's still the minor obstacle of the fact that Ben is technically still married to Jennifer Garner, but it seems Affleck and Shookus won't allow that pesky little detail to stand in their way.  According to Radar Online, Ben and Lindsay are currently in the process of planning a Hawaiian wedding.  \u201cThey want to do it before the end of summer when Lindsay goes back to work on SNL,\u201d an insider tells the site.  \u201cThey love Hawaii and had a great time there in April when Ben was filming Triple Frontier.\u201d  Is it just us, or does a Ben Affleck movie set in Hawaii with the title of Triple Frontier sound like something from an SNL sketch?

Wow, if that's not the ultimate act of passive aggression.  Hey, Jen do you think you could watch the kids during the one weekend I'm supposed to have them this summer? Lindsay and I have plans. I already bought the rings and everything.  Anyway, the most interesting part of all this is the fact that Ben and Lindsay are reportedly expecting a child together.  \u201cPeople suspect the sense of urgency is because Lindsay\u2019s pregnant,\u201d the informant claims.  \u201cAnd nothing hides a bump better than a muumuu dress.\u201d  Well, if the speculation is based on nothing other than the fact that these two seem to be in a hurry and some traditional Hawaiian attire is baggy, then we're gonna have to go ahead and call BS.  But who knows?  Maybe Lindsay really is pregnant with Ben's baby, as the tabloids have been claiming for most of the past year.  If so, our sincere congrats go out to a couple that most folks didn't give much of a chance to.  Just keep Ben away from those mai-tais at the wedding!",

However, it seems like there is no truth to these claims.  OK! recently claimed that Garner and Duhamel's secret romance is \"full steam ahead,\" and the rumored couple is already on the \"verge of going public.\" The magazine also published a photo of the \"Safe Haven\" actor with Garner and her kids.  The tabloid claimed that Fergie's ex-husband has been spending most of his time at Garner's Pacific Palisades mansion lately and even brings his son along with him. \"They're fast becoming a modern family,\" an so-called source said.  However, according to Gossip Cop, there is no truth to reports claiming that Duhamel has already met Garner's kids. The tabloid only took a paparazzi shot of the \"Peppermint\" star with her children and digitally altered it to add Duhamel into the frame as if they were together.  The tabloid also claimed that Garner and Duhamel are getting serious and even go to church together. However, this might be unlikely as the \"13 Going On 30\" actress attends church service with her kids and they are sometimes joined by her ex-husband, Ben Affleck.  For instance, on Sunday, Garner was seen arriving in church in a minivan with her three children: Violet, 9, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5. Later on, Affleck was spotted in the same area in his car. The family attended the church service together.  Garner and Affleck were also seen together the day before as they watched Samuel's basketball practice. Thus, the celebrity mom has no time to date her \"Love, Simon\" co-star.  In addition, Garner recently said that she is not seeing anyone and is not interested in dating. \"I haven't been on a date and I am not interested in dating,\" Garner told Entertainment Tonight in November. \"People want to set me up and I am just like, 'No thank you!'

But when the 44-year-old actress was asked by a camera man if she was pregnant with estranged husband Ben Affleck's fourth child, she put up her wall.  'How 'bout that?' was all the Miracles From Heaven actress would say. She said it in a way that was half casual and playful, and half perturbed. Soon after the Hollywood vet walked to her waiting car.  Scroll down for video...  Awkward to say the least: Jennifer Garner was asked on Tuesday outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica about rumours she's pregnant again to which she answered 'How 'bout that?'  This is what started it all: On Sunday the Alias vet looked like she had a bit of a bump. But Garner could have just had a big meal or a gust of wind could have gone up the dress  The camera man asked the question because on Sunday the mother-of-three looked to have a baby bump when walking in LA with a print dress.  Garner could have just had a big meal or a gust of wind could have gone up the dress.  Either way, it does not seem likely that the siren is expecting a fourth child as she appears to not have reconciled with Affleck. TMZ cautioned on Wednesday the two are not back together.  But other outlets are claiming the longtime twosome have worked things out. The cover of OK! this week is devoted to a story on how Jennifer has taken Ben back after he begged on his knees to give him another chance.  InTouch Weekly claimed 'the divorce is off' as they two plan a second honeymoon in the Turks And Caicos.  Girls night out! The 44-year-old was with a female pal before she was asked the question  The star looked fresh-faced as she left the Italian eatery with her pals in a casual chic ensemble.  Looking at ease with her pals, the brunette beauty - who is mum to Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4 - strolled through the streets of Santa Monica in a simple navy blue v-neck jumper with eye-catching striped shirt detailing.  Flashing a hint of her bra, the Mother's Day star paired her stylish top with loose fitting jeans that hugged her ankles and flaunted her metallic silver sandals.  Beaming! The ex of Scott Foley sure let the question roll off her as she walked to a waiting SUV  Boasting a healthy glow, Jennifer kept her make-up to a minimum letting her chocolate brown peepers pop while her chestnut locks fell loose onto her shoulders.    Jennifer's night out with her girlfriends comes after she filmed her latest commercial for Capital One credit cards in Los Angeles on Tuesday.  The actress wore a crimson, sleeveless blouse as she walked around the set in Los Angeles.  The Dallas Buyers Club actress added slim black pants and stylish black heels as she ran through her lines.  Bright spot: Jennifer looked stylish in a crimson top as she filmed her new Capital One credit card ad  The Alias alum appeared to be in good spirits, laughing and joking with crew members during a quick break on set.  Jennifer, who is a longtime spokesperson for the finance company, wore her light brunette hair down in soft waves, and accessorized with a gold bangle.  She added peach blush, eyeliner and dark pink lipstick to her polished look.  Last month, Jennifer marked one year since she and estranged husband Affleck announced they were splitting up after 10 years of marriage.  It's Batman! Jennifer's estranged husband Ben Affleck waved to fans as he arrived at Comic-Con to chat about Justice League on Saturday  However, the pair have remained close, with Batman v Superman star Ben even living in the same home, in order to make the transition easier on their three children.  She also traveled with the children to London for a few weeks over the summer to spend time as a family while Ben filmed Justice League.  A source told People magazine that Ben and Jen are 'still figuring things out' and still have not filed divorce papers a year after their split.  'Ben still doesn't want the divorce and he might actually get his way,' a friend of Jennifer's said.  The actress also has a few films in the works, including the film adaptation of bestseller The Tribes of Palos Verdes, and a comedy with Kevin Spacey called Nine Lives.  Meanwhile, Ben was been busy promoting his next Batman outing Justice League at Comic-Con International in San Diego over the weekend.",

That\u2019s what came to mind when I saw these exclusive Daily Mail photos (we don\u2019t have access to them, you can see them on the Daily Mail) of Affleck out with a \u201cmystery blonde.\u201d The two went out to lunch, for sushi, and to a bookstore. The woman is grabbing his arm like she wants to indicate that they\u2019re together and is looking at Ben for validation. He\u2019s trying to look away and frown but he\u2019s grinning slightly, like he\u2019s trying to frown, but is happy to be caught out with her. In other photos he just looks defeated, like he knows he was busted and there\u2019s no way out of this one. So is this a business thing and are they just playing up for the cameras?  I would say that the woman could be an industry-type person, like a producer, or she might be staff. She\u2019s wearing jeans and he\u2019s in corduroys, which isn\u2019t particularly business-y, but people keep it casual in LA. It\u2019s possible that they had some kind of lunch business meeting. Anything is possible, this might not be a hookup, but look at how she\u2019s looking at him, for approval, and look at how he\u2019s responding. They\u2019re at least friends who are messing with the paps.  Remember when a story came out that Ben was spotted in Miami, in an Uber, with a \u201cmystery blonde woman?\u201d The two allegedly looked like they\u2019d just had a fight. That was later denied as a case of mistaken identity, which you would expect even if it was him. Ben was also spotted getting a suite at the Beverly Hills hotel with a \u201chot blonde.\u201d I suspect there\u2019s more than just one.  Many of you will point out that he\u2019s separated from his wife, they probably have an understanding, and this is technically not cheating, if that\u2019s even what\u2019s going on. Whatever agreement Affleck has Garner surely involves keeping up appearances and by getting papped out with this woman he\u2019s breaking that. Plus he\u2019s been working so hard to maintain his image ahead of Live By Night. That\u2019s got to sting. Maybe he\u2019s sick of keeping up appearances though. He can only play it straight for so long.  Update: Thanks to Charlotte and our original tipster for pointing out that the sign in the bookshop window reads September 29, 2014. These photos seem old. However here\u2019s a link to photos of Ben in September, 2014. The last two sets are from the 27th and 29th of the month. He didn\u2019t have a beard then and he wasn\u2019t this filled out. It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s after September 29 though because his looks change quickly. I wonder what is going on and if these are indeed old photos or if we\u2019re reading the date wrong. Ben also isn\u2019t wearing his wedding ring, but he took it off some time ago.  Update 2: Page Six reports that the woman with Affleck is a detox nurse and sober companion.

I would say that the woman could be an industry-type person, like a producer, or she might be staff. She\u2019s wearing jeans and he\u2019s in corduroys, which isn\u2019t particularly business-y, but people keep it casual in LA. It\u2019s possible that they had some kind of lunch business meeting. Anything is possible, this might not be a hookup, but look at how she\u2019s looking at him, for approval, and look at how he\u2019s responding. They\u2019re at least friends who are messing with the paps.  Remember when a story came out that Ben was spotted in Miami, in an Uber, with a \u201cmystery blonde woman?\u201d The two allegedly looked like they\u2019d just had a fight. That was later denied as a case of mistaken identity, which you would expect even if it was him. Ben was also spotted getting a suite at the Beverly Hills hotel with a \u201chot blonde.\u201d I suspect there\u2019s more than just one.  Many of you will point out that he\u2019s separated from his wife, they probably have an understanding, and this is technically not cheating, if that\u2019s even what\u2019s going on. Whatever agreement Affleck has Garner surely involves keeping up appearances and by getting papped out with this woman he\u2019s breaking that. Plus he\u2019s been working so hard to maintain his image ahead of Live By Night. That\u2019s got to sting. Maybe he\u2019s sick of keeping up appearances though. He can only play it straight for so long.  Update: Thanks to Charlotte and our original tipster for pointing out that the sign in the bookshop window reads September 29, 2014. These photos seem old. However here\u2019s a link to photos of Ben in September, 2014. The last two sets are from the 27th and 29th of the month. He didn\u2019t have a beard then and he wasn\u2019t this filled out. It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s after September 29 though because his looks change quickly. I wonder what is going on and if these are indeed old photos or if we\u2019re reading the date wrong. Ben also isn\u2019t wearing his wedding ring, but he took it off some time ago.  Update 2: Page Six reports that the woman with Affleck is a detox nurse and sober companion. The Daily Mail has updated their original story to reflect this.",
        "generated_text": "Ben Affleck, 47, was recently spotted out with a mystery blonde woman, leading to speculation about their relationship status. The two were seen enjoying lunch together and were caught holding hands, indicating that they may be more than just friends. While Affleck has been trying to maintain his public image, this outing may have been a breach of his agreement with wife Jennifer Garner. The actress, 48, and Affleck, who have been separated since April, have been keeping their relationship as civil as possible for the sake of their children, Violet, 12, and Samuel, 9. Despite the separation, Affleck has been spending time with his children, including taking them to a father-daughter dance over the weekend. The actor, who is also working on his latest film, Live By Night, has been trying to keep his personal life out of the public eye, but this outing may have been a slip-up.",

She had him in meditation and they were doing it together,\u201d a source close to the former couple told the outlet. \u201cHis recovery was something that was very important to both of them.\"  And though Shookus stood by Affleck's side for a little more than a year, according to the source, it became increasingly more complicated for her to keep up with her then-boyfriend as he reportedly entered a more aggressive downward spiral during in the last few months of their relationship.  Sadly, the Emmy Award-winning producer decided that it was best for her to take a step back from their relationship so that the \"Argo\" actor could focus more on himself and getting better.  \u201cIt was very hard for her to break up with Ben, but she knew he wasn\u2019t getting better and that it was time for her to step aside,\u201d the source said to People. \u201cShe was trying to stay as close to him as possible so that he would stay on the right path, but ultimately it just wasn\u2019t possible. She knew she had to let him hit bottom.\u201d  The insider continued, \u201cAll she wanted was for him to be happy and healthy. It was a difficult choice but the right one.\u201d  On Wednesday, Ben Affleck checked into rehab for the third time after his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, staged an intervention, according to multiple reports.  TMZ was first to report that the star checked into a treatment facility after Garner went to his Pacific Palisades home to sit down with him. Garner reportedly left the home visibly shaken, before returning shortly after with an unidentified woman. After that, all three got in a car and headed for a treatment facility.  In the days leading up to his encounter with Garner, The Blast obtained photos of Affleck receiving a delivery of alcohol at his home. People reported that Affleck has been in ongoing treatment and has attended meetings for alcohol abuse. The magazine also noted that he knew he needed treatment and reportedly didn't resist Garner's pleas for him to enter rehab.  An insider told Page Six that Affleck was \"having a tough time\" since ending his yearlong relationship with the \"Saturday Night Live\" producer.  Affleck is now reportedly in a live-in treatment facility, where he will stay for an extended period of time.  Prior to traveling to rehab, Affleck was snapped on two occasions with rumored new girl, Playboy model Shauna Sexton. The two were recently spotted at Malibu's celeb hot-spot Nobu and were also photographed on a much more low-key outing at a Jack in the Box drive-thru, grabbing hamburgers and fries in Affleck's Range Rover.  While the 46-year-old actor was snapped driving to rehab on Wednesday, Sexton was spotted on the beaches of Malibu rocking an olive-green bikini and enjoying a relaxing a day in the sun.  On Saturday morning, news broke that Affleck and Garner have officially finalized their divorce following their 3-year split. TMZ reported that the couple would officially settle the divorce case after the actor is released from rehab.  According to the outlet, the famous couple reached a custody settlement, in which they agreed to Affleck having joint custody of their three children, and a property settlement.",

Garner and Affleck also have not \u201ccalled off\u201d their divorce. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust these untruths.  The latest cover of Star features photos of Garner and Shookus that were taken from side angles, giving the false illusion of protruding stomachs. These misleading pictures are being used to sell an entirely fabricated narrative about Affleck impregnating both women. It\u2019s evident right in the sub-headline inside the issue that this is all bogus, with the magazine writing, \u201cSources Say Ben Affleck May Be Gearing Up For New Babies \u2014 With Both His Girlfriend And His Ex-Wife!\u201d Garner is not Affleck\u2019s \u201cex-wife,\u201d as they are still legally married, and the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d indicates the outlet doesn\u2019t have any legitimate confirmation to back up its claims.  In fact, the publication goes on to contend Affleck \u201ccould be expecting a child not only with Lindsay \u2014 but also with Jen.\u201d Notably, neither \u201cmay\u201d nor \u201ccould\u201d appear on the cover, where it\u2019s declared Shookus and Garner are \u201cboth pregnant.\u201d The tabloid lures readers in with what appears to be an announcement, but then changes course in the actual story, which is apparently about the possibility that they\u2019re both carrying the actor\u2019s babies. Following this bait-and-switch, a so-called \u201csource\u201d calls the situation a \u201cmess,\u201d but asserts \u201cthe initial shock is wearing off,\u201d and Affleck is \u201cactually feeling good about it.\u201d  But how is it not known for sure then whether or not Garner and Shookus are expecting? The logic is faulty throughout the piece. It\u2019s alleged that Affleck possibly impregnated Garner when he supposedly spent the night at her home back on March 7. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret Ben was trying to woo Jen back, even while seeing Lindsay,\u201d claims the tabloid\u2019s untraceable \u201cinsider,\u201d while the unnamed \u201csource\u201d theorizes Affleck and Garner \u201cmay have had a brief magic moment\u201d during the unverified \u201csleepover.\u201d Meanwhile, another anonymous \u201cinsider\u201d contends that unidentifiable \u201cpeople\u201d are now \u201cbuzzing she\u2019s pregnant, and that the timing lines perfectly up with the night Ben slept at her place.\u201d  As for Shookus, the magazine asserts she\u2019s \u201crumored to be pregnant, too,\u201d with another purported \u201csource\u201d alleging there\u2019s \u201ctalk of a baby on the way.\u201d She and Affleck are said to be \u201cboth very happy, in spite of the unusual circumstances,\u201d which is a clear contradiction from the cover line that maintains Shookus\u2019 \u201cbaby joy\u201d has been \u201cshattered.\u201d In another red flag, there\u2019s nothing said in the article about Affleck and Garner calling off their divorce, despite that also being touted on the front of the issue.  Gossip Cop also already busted this same outlet a few weeks ago for falsely claiming Shookus is pregnant. As we pointed out then, just days before that tale was published Shookus and Affleck went on a double date with her parents, where she was seen drinking wine. That same weekend, Shookus and Affleck were photographed on a hike with her family, and it was clear from her pictured bared midriff that she does not have any kind of a baby bump. That was on June 24, a week after the misleading June 16 photo of Shookus that Star uses on its cover. Basically, she didn\u2019t have a baby bump and then eight days later it disappeared.  In regards to the actor reconciling with his estranged wife, People examined the state of Affleck and Garner\u2019s relationship on the one-year anniversary of the divorce filing, and reported that while they co-parent and support one another, he is in a \u201cvery committed relationship\u201d with Shookus. That means no dalliances with Garner. Furthermore, Garner just did a YouTube live stream with Martha Stewart this week, and it\u2019s apparent from the video that she, too, doesn\u2019t have a baby bump. The photo of Garner on the cover was taken on July 4, a full 12 days before her later flat-stomach appearance with Stewart.  Conclusion: More recent photos of Garner and Shookus than the ones used by the tabloid show that neither of them has a baby bump. There is also independent reporting about Shookus drinking wine after the cover picture was taken, and another reputable outlet has reported that Garner and Affleck aren\u2019t involved romantically any more. That rules out pregnancies for both women. In addition to all this transparent evidence, Garner\u2019s spokesperson, who is authorized to speak on her behalf, confirms to Gossip Cop that she is neither pregnant nor having a rendezvous with Affleck. For his part, Affleck\u2019s rep tells us on the record that the double pregnancy cover story is \u201cso crazy\u201d and untrue that it\u2019s \u201camusing almost.\u201d And a Shookus confidante, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, calls the claims both \u201chilarious\u201d and \u201cnot true.\u201d",

I really \u2014 I could cry talking about it.\u201d  She added, \u201cWhat I think I\u2019ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen.

Especially not Kris Jenner.  Details about the Olympian-turned-reality-star\u2019s decision to transition in 2015 from Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner and confirmation that she had her final gender reassignment surgery are all in the book, but some dishy material about the Kardashian matriarch is reverberating with fans and upsetting the reigning first family of reality TV.  The memoir, co-written by Buzz Bissinger, who penned the Vanity Fair article that introduced Caitlyn Jenner to the masses, has some kind words for the momager, including admiration for Kris\u2019 connections, her business acumen and her ability to perfectly apply lip liner without a mirror.  However, Caitlyn also said in the book that she told Kris about her gender issues before they got married and said Kris knew that for 4\u00bd years before they met, Caitlyn had been on hormones. Additionally, Caitlyn wrote that she told Kris about her gender problems before they would make love.  \u201cI told her there had been a woman inside me all my life,\u201d she wrote.  The couple announced their split in 2013 and finalized their divorce in 2014. During their decades-long union, Caitlyn cross-dressed in front of her ex but was asked by Kris to do it only while traveling, so that their children wouldn\u2019t get wind of it. It was something Caitlyn grew to resent, she said, and she would steal her wife\u2019s gowns and purses to wear while traveling. (Their differing takes on their marital woes have been a topic of discussion for years.)  In a recent episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d Kris fumed with anger about passages in \u201cThe Secrets of My Life\u201d that claimed she knew Caitlyn was transgender before they wed.  \u201cNone of it makes sense,\u201dKris said to daughters Khloe and Kim Kardashian. \u201cI read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time. ... Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?\u201d  She added: \u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life.\u201d  In response, the Olympic gold medalist said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the book is \u201cextraordinarily honest.\u201d  \u201cIt is my perspective, and obviously when you do a book like that, there are different opinions. I have a lot of friends that know the truth and know what I\u2019ve been through and know the whole situation,\u201d Caitlyn said.  She told Andy Cohen that in the wake of publishing, Kris said she didn\u2019t want to talk to Caitlyn ever again. (Caitlyn also elaborated on her claims that she was a \u201cpunching bag\u201d on the show and a revelation that Kris had been in charge of her finances.)  \u201cHonestly, I never had a low point [while doing the show], actually, until the other day when Kris said some of that stuff. It was the first time I was really upset,\u201d she said. \u201cI had some of the best conversations with my children on that show. ... It forces you to deal with issues. ... It forces you to sit down with your kids and deal with a lot of things.\u201d  Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner\u2019s second-born child with the late Robert Kardashian, shared her thoughts on the feud on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in an episode that aired Thursday.  \u201cMy heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and [Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair. Things aren\u2019t truthful.\u201d  Kardashian said Caitlyn was dishonest \u201cwith certain things\u201d about Kris in the book.  \u201cI feel like it\u2019s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now. But it\u2019s just so hurtful,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.\u201d  Kardashian said she and husband Kanye West have been avid supporters of Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition and wanted to remain respectful of her, but thought there was no need to \u201cbash\u201d the family. She said she was hurt by her stepfather, who\u2019s dad to her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and hasn\u2019t spoken to Caitlyn in a few weeks.  \u201cKendall and Kylie, that\u2019s their dad and I think my mom\u2019s been so respectful for so long and always wanting Caitlyn around and always wanting to have a great relationship with Caitlyn,\u201d Kardashian said. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case for the rest of the Kardashian brood.  \u201cI\u2019ll always love her. That was my stepdad for so many years. She taught me about character and so much growing up and I just feel like I don\u2019t respect the character that she\u2019s showing now.\u201d  Kim Kardashian\u2019s younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, is also \u201ctaking it a little tough,\u201d Caitlyn said at a book signing, according to RadarOnline. \u201cEveryone on the Jenner side is fine.

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, \u2018The Secrets of My Life\u2019. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be \u2018wholly supportive\u2019 of Jenner\u2019s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is \u2018their worst nightmare\u2019.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner\u2019s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  \u2018She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,\u2019 said the source. \u2018But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making \u2018I am Cait\u2019 shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated [\u2026] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  \u2018I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner\u2019s \u2018unpredictable\u2019 behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: \u2018[The book] is definitely something that she\u2019s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  \u2018But the family were like, it\u2019s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  \u2018They were worried because she\u2019s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.\u2019  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson\u2019s defense team during his 1995 trial.  The disgraced football star was acquitted of the charges but, in 1998, was found \u2018responsible\u2019 for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial.  Writing in her memoir, Jenner says she was in a car with Kardashian a few years after the murders when he said: 'I would\u2019ve been okay with it if they had gotten him [Simpson] in the first trial.'  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old\u2019s plan from her model son Brody  She added: 'The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.\u2019  According to a family insider, Kris and the four Kardashians now rarely speak to Jenner.  The insider said: \u2018Kylie and do [talk to Jenner]. They do keep in communication and they\u2019re fully supportive [of her transition].  \u2018But when Kylie and Kendall do speak with her, it\u2019s always secret \u2013 they don\u2019t want to bring it up to their mom or sisters because it causes a lot of drama, so they keep it secret and between them.\u2019  The source added: \u2018It\u2019s just the Kardashian part of the family that hasn\u2019t been talking to her. They feel like she had been riding on their coattails long enough for the fame and that she is really milking it for all its worth.  \u2018They feel if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own - a lot of these things that she\u2019s doing are trying to one-up them and trying to gain the spotlight back.  \u2018While [the operation] was inevitable, they think her plan to do the nude spread is over the top. That\u2019s something that is really annoying to them.\u2019",

In a recent episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d Kris fumed with anger about passages in \u201cThe Secrets of My Life\u201d that claimed she knew Caitlyn was transgender before they wed.  \u201cNone of it makes sense,\u201dKris said to daughters Khloe and Kim Kardashian. \u201cI read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time. ... Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?\u201d  She added: \u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life.\u201d  In response, the Olympic gold medalist said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the book is \u201cextraordinarily honest.\u201d  \u201cIt is my perspective, and obviously when you do a book like that, there are different opinions. I have a lot of friends that know the truth and know what I\u2019ve been through and know the whole situation,\u201d Caitlyn said.  She told Andy Cohen that in the wake of publishing, Kris said she didn\u2019t want to talk to Caitlyn ever again. (Caitlyn also elaborated on her claims that she was a \u201cpunching bag\u201d on the show and a revelation that Kris had been in charge of her finances.)  \u201cHonestly, I never had a low point [while doing the show], actually, until the other day when Kris said some of that stuff. It was the first time I was really upset,\u201d she said. \u201cI had some of the best conversations with my children on that show. ... It forces you to deal with issues. ... It forces you to sit down with your kids and deal with a lot of things.\u201d  Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner\u2019s second-born child with the late Robert Kardashian, shared her thoughts on the feud on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in an episode that aired Thursday.  \u201cMy heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and [Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair. Things aren\u2019t truthful.\u201d  Kardashian said Caitlyn was dishonest \u201cwith certain things\u201d about Kris in the book.  \u201cI feel like it\u2019s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now. But it\u2019s just so hurtful,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.\u201d  Kardashian said she and husband Kanye West have been avid supporters of Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition and wanted to remain respectful of her, but thought there was no need to \u201cbash\u201d the family. She said she was hurt by her stepfather, who\u2019s dad to her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and hasn\u2019t spoken to Caitlyn in a few weeks.  \u201cKendall and Kylie, that\u2019s their dad and I think my mom\u2019s been so respectful for so long and always wanting Caitlyn around and always wanting to have a great relationship with Caitlyn,\u201d Kardashian said. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case for the rest of the Kardashian brood.  \u201cI\u2019ll always love her. That was my stepdad for so many years. She taught me about character and so much growing up and I just feel like I don\u2019t respect the character that she\u2019s showing now.\u201d  Kim Kardashian\u2019s younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, is also \u201ctaking it a little tough,\u201d Caitlyn said at a book signing, according to RadarOnline. \u201cEveryone on the Jenner side is fine.

Especially not Kris Jenner.  Details about the Olympian-turned-reality-star\u2019s decision to transition in 2015 from Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner and confirmation that she had her final gender reassignment surgery are all in the book, but some dishy material about the Kardashian matriarch is reverberating with fans and upsetting the reigning first family of reality TV.  The memoir, co-written by Buzz Bissinger, who penned the Vanity Fair article that introduced Caitlyn Jenner to the masses, has some kind words for the momager, including admiration for Kris\u2019 connections, her business acumen and her ability to perfectly apply lip liner without a mirror.  However, Caitlyn also said in the book that she told Kris about her gender issues before they got married and said Kris knew that for 4\u00bd years before they met, Caitlyn had been on hormones. Additionally, Caitlyn wrote that she told Kris about her gender problems before they would make love.  \u201cI told her there had been a woman inside me all my life,\u201d she wrote.  The couple announced their split in 2013 and finalized their divorce in 2014. During their decades-long union, Caitlyn cross-dressed in front of her ex but was asked by Kris to do it only while traveling, so that their children wouldn\u2019t get wind of it. It was something Caitlyn grew to resent, she said, and she would steal her wife\u2019s gowns and purses to wear while traveling.

        "doc_1_text": "Grand Central Publishing  Caitlyn Jenner's long-in-the-works book has finally arrived, and as you can guess from that title, it is indeed full of secrets \u2014 so many secrets, in fact, that it's become a point of contention with Mama Kris on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. There's nothing particularly shocking in the book (except for maybe the part where Caitlyn implies she came up with the idea for KUWTK), but it's easy to see why Kris might not approve of everything she read. Below, the book's 16 biggest reveals.    1. She felt she didn\u2019t deserve the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. Caitlyn writes that she doesn't necessarily feel \"brave\" because she chose to go public with her gender identity issues, despite the fact that her decision is often described that way. \"For me it was a form of cowardice to wait so long,\" she says, adding that she doesn't think she deserved the award bestowed on her by the ESPYs back in 2015, \"but nobody would turn down such an honor.\"    2. But wants you to know that it was not a prearranged publicity stunt. Because the ESPYs took place so soon after Caitlyn's Diane Sawyer interview and Vanity Fair cover, rumors circulated that she only agreed to do the 20/20 special if she got the award. \"It is 100 percent wrong, complete bullshit,\" Caitlyn writes. \"The actual interview took place months before I was told I would be receiving the Arthur Ashe award.\"  3. Caitlyn\u2019s publicist first killed a story about her gender identity in the 1980s. After finding out that the New York Times had been looking \"to pin down a story\" on Caitlyn wearing women's clothing, Caitlyn told her publicist Alan Nierob about her feelings and had him kill it. \"He pounds the crap out of the Times,\" Caitlyn writes. \"It works.\"  4. She did a screen test for Superman but didn\u2019t want to cut her hair for the role. \"My hair is one of the few ways I can feel my femininity, and it is these tentacles that keep me going, make me feel some tiny piece of my authentic self.\"  5. Caitlyn\u2019s relationship with Khlo\u00e9 remains fractured. This much is obvious if you've seen any recent episodes of KUTWK, but according to Caitlyn, her relationship with Khlo\u00e9 has not fully recovered since her transition. \"Khlo\u00e9 has the hardest time with it,\" she says. \"It is something Khlo\u00e9 and I should talk about privately, as we have on many occasions on other sensitive subjects. But we have not, although I have tried. We have not been the same since.\"  6. The Kardashians were intentionally left out of the first Diane Sawyer special. If you watched 20/20 and thought it seemed like there wasn't very much Kris and the gang, you were right. \"They are right to feel slighted,\" says Caitlyn. \"They were slighted on purpose because of research showing that anytime a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money.\"  7. During her marriage to Kris, Kris had total control over Caitlyn\u2019s finances. According to Caitlyn, she did not have a checking account during the peak KUTWK days and her credit card purchases were \"carefully pored over.\"  8. Caitlyn really did not like O.J. Simpson. Caitlyn got to know him via Kris's friendship with Nicole Brown Simpson and never enjoyed spending time with him: \"He was the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of them.\"  9. Caitlyn thought O.J. was guilty, and according to Caitlyn, so did Kris and Robert Kardashian. Caitlyn says that she and Kris \"believed he had done it the minute we heard of her murder and the circumstances surrounding it.\" As for Kardashian, who died in 2003, Caitlyn claims that he once said while in a car, \"I would've been OK with it if they'd gotten him in the first trial.\"  10. Rumors that Caitlyn regretted transitioning are completely untrue. Ian Halperin, who wrote the unauthorized biography Kardashian Dynasty, claimed in 2016 that Caitlyn regretted her transition. Caitlyn slams these rumors as \"100 percent wrong and garbage and swill.\"  11. She may have been the real brains behind the KUTWK operation. In one throwaway line, Caitlyn hints that she's actually the person who came up with the idea to film the Kardashian family. \"The house is awash in puberty and adolescence and young adulthood and two parents with very different styles,\" she writes. \"It seems to me something is there for television.\" Then, in a new paragraph: \"Kris says she is the one who came up with the idea and decided to actively pitch it to Ryan Seacrest.\" Care to weigh in, Ryan?  12. Caitlyn\u2019s family was embarrassed by KUTWK. Caitlyn says her aunt Ellie sent a letter to her and Kris after the show debuted about how Caitlyn had become a \"disappointment\" to her fans. \"The implication is that I have sold myself out, willingly destroyed what positive reputation I have left,\" she writes. \"Pretty much on the mark.\"  13. But Caitlyn says her depiction on the show was more or less accurate. \"I come across in the reality show as a well-meaning but slightly doddering patriarch who has no life of his own and is subsumed by the women who surround him and only does what his wife tells him,\" she writes. \"In other words: a totally true depiction.\"  14. Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner hated Caitlyn\u2019s Vanity Fair cover. Caitlyn says it had less to do with the photograph being \"risqu\u00e9\" and more to do with the fact that she \"did not gauge how a son would feel seeing his father in a cream-colored bustier.\"  15. Kim was a little disappointed that Caitlyn spelled her name with a \"C.\" Caitlyn's recollection of this conversation makes it seem like Kim was joking, but Caitlyn also had this to say about Kim even asking about it: \"Spoken like a true Kardashian.\"  16. Caitlyn had gender confirmation surgery, which she calls \"the Final Surgery,\" in January 2017. While this is not something a transgender person ever has an obligation to discuss (and Caitlyn herself reiterates several times that it's no one's business but the person who's having it), Caitlyn says she chose to include it because she wanted to be able to stop talking about it. \"I feel not only wonderful but liberated,\" she writes. \"I am telling you because I believe in candor. So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.\"  Follow Eliza on Twitter.  ",

        "doc_2_text": "Forget the Kardashian storm brewing around reports that different sisters are expecting babies in various ways. Another intriguing Kardashian storm brewing has to do with the reasons that the reality TV family is estranged from one-time parent Caitlyn Jenner  And the reasons have nothing to do with Caitlyn coming out as a transgender woman in 2015.  Kim Kardashian, along with her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, are fed up with \u201cshady\u201d claims Caitlyn made in her memoir about their father Robert Kardashian and his friendship with O.J. Simpson, according to Entertainment Tonight.  As Kim explains in the upcoming premiere of Season 14 of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d she\u2019s upset that Caitlyn wrote that their attorney father knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of double murder but defended him anyway to get back at their mother Kris Jenner.  In her memoir \u201cSecrets of My Life,\u201d Caitlyn said Robert was jealous that Kris had moved on so quickly after their divorce by marrying the Olympic gold medalist then known as Bruce Jenner.  According to Caitlyn\u2019s book, Robert knew it would upset Kris for him to join the defense team for Simpson in his trial on charges of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. That\u2019s because Kris had been close friends with Nicole and knew that O.J. had been violent towards her.  In a clip for Sunday night\u2019s \u201cKUWTK,\u201d Kim reads to Kourtney and Khloe excerpts from Caitlyn\u2019s memoir.

Sign up for our Coffee Break newsletter here.  \u201cIt says in Caitlyn\u2019s book, \u2018Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty, but joined the defense team to get back at his remarried ex,'\u201d Kim Kardashian reads. \u201c\u2018Robert told Caitlyn in secret after the O.J. murder trial that he believed his friend was guilty.'\u201d  Khloe cuts in: \u201cThat\u2019s not true! Like, what?\u201d  \u201cLike, to sell a book, you\u2019re gonna make something up?\u201d Kourtney says.  \u201cDad so believed in him,\u201d Kim says. \u201cIt is so shady that Caitlyn came over and gave me the book, and then on the phone she said, \u2018Well, the final version has a few more things in it, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing about you.\u2019 So, she lied to me, \u2018cause that is about me, if it\u2019s about our dad.\u201d  Kardashian also admits in a confessional interview that she and the newly self-styled transgender activist have a \u201cstrained\u201d relationship. As Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn was the patriarch of the Kardashian reality TV show. Caitlyn\u2019s coming out was featured on the show in a way that was praised as being respectful and informative on transgender issues.  \u201cI have always had Caitlyn\u2019s back,\u201d Kardashian says to her sisters in the clip. \u201cbut she is a liar. She is not a good person.\u201d  Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were found stabbed to death outside Nicole\u2019s condominium in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles on June 12, 1994.  Simpson, the San Francisco-reared Heisman Trophy winner, former NFL star and celebrity pitchman, immediately became a person of their interest in their murders. On June 17, after the infamous low-speed pursuit of his white Ford Bronco SUV, he was arrested and charged with his killings. But he was acquitted in 1995.  Robert was an original member of Simpson\u2019s \u201cdream team\u201d of high-priced, high-profile attorneys. Throughout Simpson\u2019s arrest and trial, Robert remained a steady and loyal presence.  But Caitlyn believes a jealous love triangle motivated Robert\u2019s interest in helping his friend.  Robert and Kris were married in 1978 and had four children together, future realty TV stars Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Jr. They divorced in 1991 and Kris immediately turned around and married Jenner, then a handsome, successful male athlete.  In her memoir Caitlyn wrote about Robert\u2019s sticking by Simpson: \u201cI wonder if it was (Robert\u2019s) way of saying to her what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big (expletive) you.\u201d  Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store.  Caitlyn contends that Robert knew his friend was guilty, based on a conversation Caitlyn had with Robert in the 1990s. Robert, who died of cancer in 2003, confessed his knowledge of O.J.\u2019s guilt during a car ride the two shared, Caitlyn claims. This would have been after O.J. was found liable for the deaths of Nicole and Ron Goldman in a 1998 civil trial.  \u201cI would\u2019ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial,\u201d Robert said, according to Caitlyn.  \u201cThe implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty,\u201d Caitlyn wrote.  Kris and Caitlyn divorced in 2015 after Caitlyn went public with news she\u2019s transgender. Meanwhile, Simpson will be leaving a Nevada prison on parole next month after serving time for an unrelated robbery in Las Vegas.  Caitlyn has acknowledged in interviews that she has a strained relationship with her ex-wife Kris Jenner and former Kardashian stepdaughters, though she maintains a connection with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, her daughters with Kris.  \u201cThe relationship on the Kardashian side has been strained recently,\u201d she admitted in an interview in August.  \u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t really talk to them. I haven\u2019t talked to them in months and months and months.\u201d  The upcoming episode of \u201cKUWTK\u201d won\u2019t be the first time Kim has spoken out against Caitlyn in recent weeks.

        "doc_1_text": "Caitlyn Jenner is opening up about the difficulty of maintaining a relationship with her kids following her gender transition, the mistakes she\u2019s made in her journey and how she once thought the only time she would get to publicly wear woman\u2019s clothing would be in her coffin.    The 68-year-old reality television star pours her heart out during a new profile for Broadly, in which she discusses her strained family relationships.  \u201cI spend a lot of time by myself here in the house,\u201d she tells transgender journalist Diana Tourjee. \u201cI have a lot of children, but sometimes just because of circumstances, maintaining a close relationship with your kids is very tough. They all have lives. They\u2019ve all moved on.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re just human beings; we\u2019re going to be here for a very short time,\u201d Caitlyn adds. \u201cWe come and we go and at the end, when it\u2019s all said and done, hopefully your family is going to be there.\u201d  Caitlyn also goes into detail about her initial plans to complete a gender transition by the time she turned 40, in 1989, only to get started, then backtrack, after she and then-wife, Kris Jenner, welcomed their daughter, Kendall, in 1995.  According to the article, Caitlyn underwent more than four years of hormone therapy and had developed \u201ca little B-cup\u201d by the time she met Kris (who denied knowing that Caitlyn -- who went by Bruce at the time -- was transgender when they met, during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians).  \"When Kendall was born, I had liposuction and got rid of [my breasts],\u201d explains Caitlyn, who welcomed a second daughter, Kylie, with Kris in 1997, and has four other children from previous relationships. \u201cBecause I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t even go swimming with my kid.\u2019\u201d  While she completed the transformation in 2017, she says there was a time when she imagined Caitlyn might only ever materialize upon the death of Bruce -- sharing how years ago she wanted to state in her will that she wished to be buried in female clothing.  \u201cI thought about that a lot over the years,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd, it would shock everybody. Screw \u2018em.\u201d  At her lowest point as Bruce, she kept a wig and women\u2019s clothing on board her plane and would allow Caitlyn to come to life while up in the sky, far away from the real world and feeling \u201cfree as can be.\u201d  Caitlyn also addresses the controversy ignited by her political views and comments made during media interviews, which have upset the LBGTQ community.  \u201cAlong the way, did I make mistakes? Absolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I never did it maliciously. I just didn\u2019t know, you know? And I really didn\u2019t realize how critical the community was going to be.\u201d  Regardless of the controversy, she stands by her political standing.  \u201cI think it\u2019s good that I\u2019m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Republicans need the most work when it comes to our issues, I get that. I would rather work from the inside. I\u2019m not the type of person who is going to stand on a street corner with a sign and jump up and down. No, I\u2019m going to go have dinner with these people.\u201d  The transgender community aren\u2019t the only ones whom she has felt \u201cbashing\u201d her. The Kardashians reportedly felt \"betrayed\" when Caitlyn published her 2017 memoir, The Secrets of My Life.  \u201cI got the trans community out there bashing on me, I got the Kardashians out there bashing on me,\u201d she reflects. \u201cAll I do is sit here in the house and try to stay out of trouble.\u201d  See more on the I Am Cait star below.

OJ's prison guard, Jeffrey Felix, claims he heard the pair having a conversation at Lovelock prison in Nevada, where Simpson is serving a 33-year jail term for robbery.  8 OJ Simpsons prison guard has claimed he heard Khloe Kardashian begging OJ for a paternity test  Jeffrey spoke in an upcoming documentary, Kardashian: The Man Who Saved OJ Simpson about his claims.

However, there have been repeated rumours that Robert was not Khloe's biological father with his third wife, Ellen Pierson recently questioning his paternity.  8 Rumours about Khloe's paternity have come up a number of times in recent years Credit: Splash News  Speaking in the documentary, which will air tonight on US channel Reelz, OJ's prison guard Jeffrey speaks about Khloe's relationship with the disgraced football star.  He said: \"Khloe is his favourite.  \"The mom Kardashian does not talk to OJ. She's upset with OJ for thinking that he killed her best friend, Nicole Brown.  \"But I know he still talks to Khloe behind her back.  \"In the prison, the phone calls have to be made out by OJ, so he would call at least once a week. That was his way of keeping up with the Kardashians...\"  He then claims that her paternity came up in one of these conversations and OJ tried to calm her down.  Jeffrey said: \"One day I could hear Khloe screaming in the phone.  \"He said she was upset because she wanted him to take a paternity test, because the media is all over him, to see if OJ is her actual dad - and OJ told her 'no'.  \"A few minutes after that phone call he pulled me up and asked me what I would do, and I told the Juice to take it, and he said 'no'.  \"And I said, 'Why won't you take it?'.

Robert's second wife, Jan Ashley backed up Ellen's claims and said he told her that Khloe wasn't his.  Jan told Star magazine: \"Khloe is not his kid \u2014 he told me that after we got married.  \"He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said, 'Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?'\"  8 Robert Kardashian said Khloe was his biological child in some legal documents Credit: Instagram  However, in legal documents that surfaced when Robert was trying to gain an annulment from Jan, he described Khloe as his \"biological child\".  Both Khloe and her mother Kris reacted angrily to the claims and Khloe admitted earlier this year that it was really tough having other people discuss who her father was.  8 Khloe said she finds it hurtful when people discuss her dad, who died in 2003, and her paternity Credit: Instagram  Speaking on Kocktails with Khloe, she said: \"I think the thing that most became overwhelming was when, like, the stuff happened with one of my dad's wives.  \"She wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I'm not his daughter and that he confided in her and blah-say-blah.  \"I was like, 'Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f***ing want. Do not talk about my dad\u2026He's not here!'\"  Neither Kris or Khloe have responded to the fresh claims.  Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220",

Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.\"\n\nJenner, who legally changed her name to Caitlyn Marie and her gender to female in October 2016, has been open about her journey towards becoming a woman. In a previous episode of I Am Cait, she said, \"Gender confirmation surgery is something I think anybody in my position, or the girls' position, of course you look into. For me, I have no idea what the future holds.\"\n\nJenner, 68, and Sophia Hutchins, 21, have been fueling dating rumors after attending the 2018 ESPY Awards in Los Angeles. They have yet to confirm their relationship, but DailyMail.com reports that they are living together at Jenner's Malibu pad. They have also been spotted together over the past few months and attended the Life Ball together in Vienna in June.\n\nOverall, Jenner's memoir provides a glimpse into her journey towards becoming a woman, and her decision to undergo gender confirmation surgery. Her openness and candor about her journey is inspiring, and she serves as a role model for others who are also on their own journeys towards self-discovery and acceptance.",

I've kind of let everything calm down,\" she said. \"I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance.\"  \"I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world,\" the 67-year-old reality star added. \"There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.

        "doc_2_text": "Caitlyn Jenner has no plans to detransition back to Bruce.  A rep for the reality star said that a report that she wants to transition back to a male is untrue.  Ian Halperin, the author of Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America\u2019s Royal Family, first made the claim after speaking with multiple sources he said told him that Jenner had been experiencing 'sex change regret.'  Halperin told The Wrap that one of Jenner's longtime friend - who is not named - told him her detransition could happen in the next few years.  Scroll down for video  Claims: Caitlyn Jenner (above in April) may detransition back to Bruce according to multiple sources who spoke with Ian Halperin  Report: Halperin claims one longtime friend of Jenner told him; 'I think there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll de-transition in the next couple years' (Jenner above in September 2013)  'It hasn\u2019t been easy for Caitlyn, it\u2019s been very hard,' Halperin said Jenner's longtime friend told him.  'She\u2019s thrilled she has raised awareness about how transgender people have long been discriminated against but I think there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll detransition in the next couple years.  'I don\u2019t think it would surprise anybody in her inner circle.  'It has been much harder than she anticipated. My heart goes out to her and I know her true friends will be there to support her on whatever path she chooses.'  Halperin is also claiming that multiple sources have told him Jenner is also thinking about detransitioning because she is still attracted to woman.  'Not worth commenting on such an idiotic report,' a rep for Jenner told the New York Daily News when asked about the report Thursday morning.  'Of course it's not true.'  Jenner publicly revealed she was transitioning in a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer last year, telling the veteran newscaster; 'For all intents and purposes, I am a woman.'  She went on to say in that interview; 'My brain is much more female than it is male. That's what my soul is. Bruce lives a lie. She is not a lie. I can't do it anymore.'  DETRANSITIONING The process of detransitioning varies drastically from person to person based on the hormones they have taken and surgeries they have undergone, if any. In the case of a person who has transitioned from male to female a doctor would most likely take them off of estrogen and put them on testosterone. The individual would also be encouraged to receive therapy during this time to work through any possible trauma or mental health problems caused by the switch in hormones. A MtF individual can reverse their breast augmentation by having their implants removed. If a person wants to reverse a vaginoplasty their pelvic space would be closed and a neo-phallus created.  Then, last June, Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair's July issue wearing a white satin bustier with the words; 'I Am Caitlyn.'  She said in the accompanying interview that shooting the cover of the magazine was better than winning an Olympic gold medal.  'The last few days of doing this shoot was about my life and who I am as a person,' said Caitlyn.  'It's not about the fanfare, it's not about the people cheering in the stadium, its not about going down the street getting an ''Atta boy Bruce\" pat on the back, okay, this is about your life.  'Soon as the Vanity Fair cover comes out, I'm free.'  Later that day Jenner created a Twitter account, writing in her first tweet; 'I\u2019m so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can\u2019t wait for you to get to know her/me.'  It was also announced around this time that Jenner would begin appearing in the E! reality show I Am Cait, which debuted last July and recently finished airing its second season.  Halperin claimed in his Kardashian book that Kris Jenner was aware of Caitlytn's desire to transition and wrote that she forced him to attend religious conversion therapy.  Chelsea Attonley, a British woman who detransitioned, shared her story with Vice, saying how positive her transition was at first and how it eliminated her depression.  'Overnight it just disappeared,' she said.  'I felt absolutely amazing, I felt at peace with myself and that everything was right with the world.'  Problems soon arose however and she made the decision to detransition.  Her doctors decided to start this by slowly weaning her off of the hormones she was taking and reversing the breast augmentation they had performed.  'I had to stop the transition because it was affecting my mental health too much and starting to affect my body,' she explained.  Reversing hormones and breast augmentation (or a double mastectomy) are far easier to do than if an individual has had a vaginoplasty or phalloplasty.  Attonley, who had not at that time had a vaginoplasty, still felt regrets even after she began to detransition however, and eventually decided to go back to being a woman.  Dr. Norman Spack, an endocrinologist at Boston Children's Hospital who treats transgender children, spoke about how rare detransitioning is in a TED Talk.  'When puberty begins, that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls, 12 to 14 in boys, with breast budding or two- to three-times increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males,' explained Dr. Spack.",

The one that made people furious, because it appropriated images from Black Lives Matter protests to sell soda? Pepsi quickly pulled the ad after intense criticism \u2014 and in the six months since the controversy, Kendall hasn\u2019t publicly responded. That\u2019s because she saved it all for the 14th season premiere of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d which aired Sunday night. The Kardashian family has said that Kendall was very upset over the backlash, and the premiere confirmed that, yes, the 21-year-old supermodel was mortified.  If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi. pic.twitter.com/FA6JPrY72V \u2014 Be A King (@BerniceKing) April 5, 2017  Although the episode ended with Kendall sobbing (\u201cObviously, if I knew that this was going to be the outcome, I would have never done something like this\u201d), it was a slow build to her breakdown. In fact, the word \u201cPepsi\u201d never came up during the entire hour. It all started as Kendall called her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian.  Advertisement  \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kourtney said when she answered the phone. \u201cYou sound so sad.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Kendall sighed.  \u201cI talked to Simon today,\u201d Kourtney said, likely referring to Simon Huck, a public relations guru and Kim Kardashian West\u2019s close friend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018The news lasts 24 hours.\u2019 \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s lasting longer,\u201d Kendall said flatly.  Cut to an on-camera interview with Khloe, who explained to the audience: \u201cKendall did a commercial and basically caused a huge controversy. It sucks, because Kendall\u2019s been taking the blame for it all. Kendall tries really hard to be socially conscious and aware of the jobs that she takes and to really think about how things affect other people, so it weighs really heavy on her heart.\u201d  Producers showed some critical tweets about the commercial, such as, \u201cSo many adults had to f\u2011\u2011\u2011 up in so many unique and equally tone deaf ways to make this awful ad, it\u2019s honestly breathtaking.\u201d  Advertisement  Kourtney assured Kendall that she spoke to family friend Russell Simmons, who said that Kendall \u201ccan turn this into a positive.\u201d This is never further explained. After they hung up, Kourtney told Khloe that it sounded like Kendall was crying.  Later, Kendall explained why she filmed the commercial in the first place \u2014 when she got the offer, she was thrilled to join the list of celebrities who have done Pepsi ads, from Michael Jackson to Beyonc\u00e9 to Britney Spears.  \u201cI trusted everyone. I trusted the teams,\u201d she told the camera. \u201cBut after I saw the reaction and I read what people had to say about it, I most definitely saw what went wrong. I was so stuck, and I really didn\u2019t know what to do, that I completely shut down.\u201d  The following scene showed Kendall sitting forlornly in her gigantic walk-in closet, talking to Kim on the phone. The new issue? Her father, Caitlyn Jenner, was going on a book tour. Kendall was worried that Caitlyn might say something about the commercial that would make things worse.  Advertisement  \u201cShe just tends to, like, say a lot, and I just would rather everyone just not say anything,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cI mean, God bless her for trying.\u201d  \u201cI know. But Caitlyn is known for saying all the wrong things,\u201d Kim said. She promised to call Caitlyn and let her know it was a very sensitive subject.  Share this article Share  So Kim called Caitlyn and told her not to answer questions about the Pepsi ad \u2014 and if she felt compelled, just say something along the lines of, \u201cKendall had the best intentions with this being something, like, peaceful, and she totally gets everyone\u2019s point of view now. It was not appropriate, and she\u2019s so sorry.\u201d  Naturally, Caitlyn did not follow that advice, and instead talked about the commercial in a radio interview and said Kendall knew all about the ad\u2019s script beforehand and thought it was fine. The episode ended as Kendall went to talk to Kim, about three weeks after the commercial was pulled. She was upset about Caitlyn, and even more about the whole situation.  Advertisement  \u201cI just feel really, really bad. Like, I feel really bad that anyone was ever offended. I feel really bad that this was taken such a wrong way,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cI genuinely feel like s\u2011\u2011\u2011, and I have no idea how I\u2019m going to bounce back from it.\u201d  \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve had a scandal,\u201d Kim gently reminded her. \u201cThis is your first real experience with something like this.\u201d  \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s a very bad one,\u201d Kendall shot back.  \u201cA very bad one,\u201d Kim agreed.  \u201cThe text messages I would get from people, they\u2019d be like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be fine, like, you know everything blows over in, like, a week\u2019s time\u2019 or whatever. And I\u2019m just like, \u2018Okay, but it\u2019s been, like, three weeks and it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u2019 \u201d Kendall said.  \u201cYeah, but it will,\u201d Kim assured her. \u201cThis is just going to be the biggest lesson learned for you.\u201d  Advertisement  \u201cI really don\u2019t even know what to do at this point. It\u2019s really depressing, and it bothers me every single day,\u201d Kendall said.  \u201cYou\u2019re the last person to want to hurt someone or be insensitive, but it\u2019s, like, it really sucks. I think the only thing you can really do is just be real and honest, because you can\u2019t ignore it. Like, you can\u2019t,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt should affect you in a way where you grow from it, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a better person from it.\u2019 . . . I just wish that you could see that there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d  Despite Kim\u2019s words of wisdom, Kendall still broke down crying to the camera.  \u201cI would never purposely hurt someone, ever,\u201d Kendall said tearfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when you\u2019re in the moment, and, like, it was the most \u2014\u201d She grappled for the right words. \u201cI just felt so f\u2011\u2011\u2011ing stupid. The fact that I would offend other people or hurt other people was definitely not the intent. And that\u2019s what got me the most, is that I would have ever made anyone else upset.\u201d  Advertisement  After Pepsi pulled the ad, the company apologized for putting Kendall Jenner in an awkward position. Last week, Pepsi chief executive Indra Nooyi told Fortune that she didn\u2019t initially see the ad\u2019s final scene that caused so much \u201cconsternation,\u201d in which Jenner handed a cop a can of Pepsi.  \u201cThis has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene,\u201d Nooyi said. \u201cAnd I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it\u2019s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.\u201d  Read more:",

        "doc_1_text": "A week after being released from prison, Alice Marie Johnson came face-to-face for the first time with Kim Kardashian West and thanked her for the pivotal role she played in getting President Trump to commute her life sentence.  The two had an emotional meeting before sitting down with TODAY exclusively for their first joint interview since Johnson\u2019s release from a federal prison. The 63-year-old inmate had served more than 21 years for nonviolent charges related to drug possession and money-laundering.  Kardashian West learned about Johnson\u2019s story last year and declared it as \u201cso unfair\u201d in a tweet to her 60 million followers. The reality television superstar then decided to take up her case.  \u201cBecause I knew that I had the resources to do that. It became this mission that I just didn't want to give up,\u201d she told TODAY\u2019s Hoda Kotb.  \u201cI mean, I think to some people it might seem like, \u2018Okay, Kim made a phone call to the president, showed up.\u2019 We had been in talks and working on this for seven months. And it wasn't an instant thing. It was a lot of work.\"  Kim Kardashian West and Alice Johnson embrace after recalling the journey that led to Johnson's commutation from a life sentence in prison.

And everyone was amazed. And I was amazed, too.\u201d  A call to Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser, eventually led to a May 30 Oval Office meeting where Kardashian West pleaded for clemency on behalf of Johnson.

Kardashian West learned about Johnson's story last year and declared it as \"so unfair\" in a tweet to her 60 million followers. She then took up Johnson's case and worked with President Trump to have her life sentence commuted. Johnson was released from prison a week after their meeting and plans to continue working on behalf of others with similar stories.",

Simpson recounted the \u201chypothetical\u201d way he might have killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman, in a controversial two-hour special on Fox Sunday night, aptly titled, O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?  Over the course of the special, Simpson described to publisher Judith Regan, in increasing detail, the series of events that could have hypothetically led to Nicole and Goldman\u2019s 1994 deaths. He made mention of a friend named \u201cCharlie\u201d who was with him at the time of the murders, though at certain points throughout the interview, he alternated between talking about Charlie and speaking in the first person.  The interview was originally conducted in 2006 in supposed conjunction with the release of his book, If I Did It. Backlash over both the proposed Fox special and the book quashed both before they could reach the public, but on Sunday, the footage finally aired, to mixed reviews. (If I Did It was eventually published by Beafort Books in September 2007, and the Goldman family won 90 percent of the proceeds of the sale of the book rights; an attorney for the Goldman family said they \u201cwelcomed\u201d the airing of the tapes, saying that the special allowed \u201ceveryone to make their own judgment.\u201d)  \u201cI think Charlie is O.J. This is no hypothetical,\u201d said Christopher Darden, who was one of the prosecutors in the 1994 trial and also part of a panel of experts on Sunday night\u2019s special. \u201cI think he confessed to murder.\u201d  Malcolm LaVergne, Simpson\u2019s current attorney, said Monday the idea that the hypothetical account amounted to a confession was \u201ca joke.\u201d  \u201cThis was scripted by Judith Regan, the publisher of the book,\u201d LaVergne told CBS This Morning. \u201cMr. Simpson went along because quite frankly, he got a lot of money up front to go along with this.\u201d  Simpson\u2019s own take on speaking out about a hypothetical murder appeared to be one of acceptance.  \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me because it\u2019s hypothetical,\u201d he said during the interview. \u201cI know and I accept the fact that people are going to feel whatever way they gonna feel.\u201d Here, the five most WTF moments from the Sunday night special.  Editor\u2019s picks  Simpson said that though Nicole and Goldman were \u201cphysically dead,\u201d they had essentially \u201ckilled\u201d him too.  The former NFL running back told Regan that he felt conflicted about his feelings toward Nicole and that he was worried that she was \u201closing herself\u201d following their divorce. When Regan asked him point-blank whether he felt lost as well, he responded with a surprisingly phrased answer: \u201cIn many ways, yeah. It was almost like Ron and Nicole were physically dead and it\u2019s almost like they killed me. Who I was was attacked and murdered also in that short period of time.\u201d He also said it \u201creally, really bothered\u201d him that a lot of people seemed to want him to be convicted of the murders.  Simpson\u2019s friend \u201cCharlie\u201d was the one who alerted him to go to Nicole\u2019s house that day.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why he had been by Nicole\u2019s house, but he told me, \u2018You wouldn\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on over there,'\u201d Simpson said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Whatever\u2019s going on over there\u2019s gotta stop.'\u201d So, according to Simpson, both he and Charlie got into his infamous white Bronco and drove to Nicole\u2019s house.

He talked about \u201cblood and stuff\u201d that was at the scene of the crime and laughingly reminded Regan that he was speaking in hypotheticals.  \u201cAs things got heated, I just remember Nicole fell and hurt herself and this guy kind of got into this karate thing,\u201d he said, describing the hypothetical moment when the confrontation escalated. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, you think you can kick my ass?\u2019 And I remember I grabbed the knife \u2013 I do remember that portion, taking a knife from Charlie \u2013 and to be honest after that I don\u2019t remember, except I\u2019m standing there and there\u2019s all kind of stuff around and \u2026\u201d As he trailed off, Regan picked up the thread and asked, \u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cBlood and stuff.\u201d  He then added with a laugh, \u201cI hate to say this, but this is hypothetical.

When Regan asked Simpson about the infamous glove that was left at the scene of the crime, and the passage in his book that said he removed it before taking the knife from Charlie, Simpson spoke in first person. \u201cYou know, I have no conscious memory of doing that [removing the glove] but obviously I must have because they found the glove there,\u201d he said. No murder weapon was ever found, though police officials have continued to look for one as recently as 2016.  He described in excruciating detail the process of getting rid of the evidence.  Simpsons recalled having to dispose of bloody clothes following the hypothetical killing. When Regan asked Simpson directly, \u201cAnd you had left your keys and wallet in your pants pocket and you had to go back and get it?\u201d a momentarily stumped Simpson replied, \u201cYou know, to be honest, I think \u2013 I know that to be true, yes.\u201d Regan immediately followed up by asking him whether he believed in heaven and hell, and whether he thought he would see his late wife again someday. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied confidently. \u201cHey, look, I\u2019ve cursed her.

        "generated_text": "Kim Kardashian West has sparked controversy with a throwback photo of her stepdad Caitlyn Jenner. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star posted a picture of Caitlyn, then-wife Kris Jenner and herself taken before Caitlyn's transition in 2015. In the caption, Kardashian West wrote \"TGIF\". Social media users were quick to react, some calling her \"petty\" while others wondered if she was throwing shade at Caitlyn. The post has reignited tensions between Caitlyn and the Kardashian family, who she has been estranged from for over a year. Caitlyn recently revealed that she hasn't talked to the Kardashians in over a year and that she kept certain pages of her memoir from them to avoid leaks to the press. In an interview, Caitlyn also admitted that she \"didn't trust\" the Kardashians and chose to keep the last few pages of her memoir from them. Despite their estrangement, Caitlyn still attends events with Kylie and Kendall Jenner and recently celebrated the arrival of Kylie's baby girl, Stormi.",

The 28-year-old maintained a polite smile but ignored journalists' requests for comment on the news that his famous father will soon be released from prison.  Justin was just seven when his mother, OJ's ex-wife Nicole Brown, was brutally murdered outside her home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, along with her friend Ron Goldman.  Scroll down for video  Justin Simpson, 28, was seen leaving a Walmart in St. Petersburg, Florida, on Thursday after his father's parole hearing  He was asleep inside with his sister Sydney who was nine at the time and is now 31.  OJ was famously acquitted of their killings in 1995. He was imprisoned in 2008 for armed robbery.  Neither Justin nor his older sister decided to show up for their father's parole hearing in Nevada on Thursday.  Their older half-sister Arnelle did show up and spoke in favor of him being released. Arnelle's brother Jason did not appear.  During the hearing, an upbeat OJ, now 70, revealed plans to move back to Florida upon his release. He may be freed as soon as October.  He spoke about Justin and his sister, telling the Nevada parole board when asked why he wanted to be freed: 'I have four kids. I've missed a lot of time with those kids.  'I\u2019ve done my time.'  Arnelle, OJ's daughter with his first wife, Marguerite Whitley, read aloud an emotional letter which helped secure her father's release.  'Thank you. I'm a little nervous, bear with me' said Arnelle while fighting back tears.  Simpson said nothing of the news of his father's impending release as he walked to his car accompanied by an unidentified woman  The 28-year-old made no comment as he hopped in to his car with his grocery bag in hand  OJ Simpson, 70, was granted parole at a hearing in Lovelock, Nevada, on Thursday  Justin's half-sister Arnelle spoke in favor of their father's release. She was the only one of his four children who attended the hearing  'As you know I'm here on behalf of my family. For the purpose of expressing what we believe is the true character of my father. No one really knows how much we have been through. This ordeal in the last nine years.  'My experience is that he's like my best friend and my rock. And as a family, we recognize that he is not the perfect man but he's clearly a man and a father that has done his best to behave the way that speaks to his overall nature and character.  'Which is always to be positive no matter what. He has spent the last nine years in Lovelock as we all know and has been a perfect inmate following all the rules and making the best of the situation.'  She referred to her 'sister and brother' but it's likely she was referring to her full-blood brother Jason and their deceased sister, Aaren, who died as a toddler after falling into a swimming pool.  She went in to a coma after being submerged in the water and never woke up.",

But that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t control her own narrative\u2014if anything, Jenner pulls the ultimate millennial power move by telling her story when and how she wants. In her latest Vogue profile, she addresses her love life, her sexuality, that Pepsi ad, and whether there is another Kardashian addition in the future head-on.  For one thing, is she gay? \u201cSo it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy,\u201d she tells Vogue. \u201cI would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time. You don\u2019t want to, like, look crazy.\u201d But she essentially confirms that she is in fact dating Detroit Pistons basketball player Blake Griffin, coyly phoning from Michigan on Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d she finally admits. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice. I have someone being very nice to me.\u201d But if she weren\u2019t dating Griffin, and if she weren\u2019t, in fact, heterosexual, Jenner says that she isn\u2019t the type to hide it. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don\u2019t know!

I have literally nothing to hide\u2026. I would never hide something like that.\u201d  As for the Pepsi ad heard round the world, Jenner had a difficult time in the fallout. \u201cObviously, my intention was not to hurt anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cHonestly, I just hid out. It hurt me that I hurt other people\u2026. I\u2019ve been yelled at before, stepped in controversy before, but nothing to that extent. You can never really prepare for something like that.\u201d But she has learned, as \u201ca huge people pleaser,\u201d to be more aware of goings on on set, where, she said, \u201cI need to be more present and pay more attention.\u201d  One thing Jenner isn\u2019t mincing her words over is whether she\u2019ll be joining her sisters in their very contemporaneous pregnancies. \u201cI am ready to wait,\u201d she clarifies, having just bought a new home and forming plans to maybe begin competing as an equestrian under an androgynous alias. \u201cI want to have kids, but at, like, 28 or 29.\u201d",

That plot might sound a bit absurd, but my advice? Just go with it. Whitman, Hendricks, and Retta's chemistry alone is worth adding a new show to your queue.  As for the show's tongue-in-cheek title, creator Jenna Bans says it's part of a larger conversation. \"My mom would say, 'Always be a good girl!' and she didn't mean it in an anti-feminist way. But as I got older\u2014especially into my 30s\u2014I was like, 'Fuck that, I don't have to be a good girl.' Christina Hendricks said that we're giving a huge middle finger to the phrase, and I think it's really true. You don't have to be a good girl; you don't have to do anything but you.\"  While no one is suggesting you rob a supermarket, Bans says these characters\u2014who have never done anything illegal before\u2014are doing it for good because that's what they need to tell themselves in order to do it. \"These are women who are backed into a corner,\" she explains.  How so? Well, Retta plays Ruby, a married mother who desperately needs money for an experimental drug for her daughter's kidney disease. Whitman is Annie, a young mom who will do whatever it takes to have custody of her daughter. \"She's also being sexually harassed in her shitty job at the grocery store,\" Bans says. And Hendricks stars as Beth, a wife and mom who finds out her cheating husband has lost their savings.  \"These characters do questionable things,\" Bans says. (No kidding.) \"You can argue whether they do them for the right reasons or not, but we just kind of do it. There's one scene where Retta's daughter's doctor says, 'You probably can't afford [this medication],' and he's just judging by her waitress uniform. I don't know if that's overt sexism, but it's definitely subtle classism. We try to tackle those types of things in a way that's not in your face, but they are inherent to what these women's lives are. Hopefully, we're saying something.\"  Bans has been wanting to say something ever since the 2016 election, in which she underestimated the deep-rooted anger of so many Americans toward Hillary Clinton. \"I was talking to my mom that I don't remember this feeling of 'everybody hates women' being so overt. There were all the rallies and the 'lock her up' chants, and my mom was having a really hard time even though she knew it existed. So the show was fueled from a little bit of anger and desire to completely escape from it.\"",

        "doc_2_text": "Caitlyn Jenner: her confrontation with the Kardashians about pay per view TV special, her lonely Mother\u2019s day, and her new date: Know all that here!  The alleged confrontation with Kardashians about a \u2018pay-per-view TV special\u2019  \u2018Life and Style\u2019 has recently written about the feud between Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner and her ex Caitlyn Jenner (earlier Bruce Jenner) about the details Caitlyn Jenner had put down on his gender transition in his new autobiography titled \u2018The Secrets of My Life.  Kris Jenner feels that she has been projected in a bad light in the book and has been labeled as \u2018being less understanding\u2019. The tabloid alleged that Caitlyn Jenner is angry with the Kardashians for not keeping their mouth shut about his transition.  Caitlyn Jenner feels that they are spreading lies about her and wants them all to undergo a polygraph (lie detector test) to prove their falsehood. The tabloid further adds that Kris Jenner said that she is ready to undergo the test provided the price is right.  However, Gossip Cop has found out that all these stories revolving around the Kardashians and their extended family are untrue. Jenner\u2019s rep has labeled the tabloid\u2019s story as being inaccurate.  Also, Gossip Cop inquired with several people in the pay-per-view business and none of them had heard about Caitlyn trying to set up any live TV special with her ex-wife and estranged daughters and stepdaughters.  The lonely Mother\u2019s Day  It was seen that her ex-wife Kris Jenner celebrated Mother\u2019s day with her 6 children: Kourtney Kardashian (38), Kim Kardashian (36), Khloe Kardashian (32), Rob Kardashian (29), Kendall Jenner (21), and Kylie Jenner (19). Kris Jenner has fallen apart from her husband Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce Jenner) after he launched his autobiography \u2018The Secrets of my Life\u2019.  In this autobiography, Caitlyn Jenner has mentioned that she had never been comfortable having sex with Kris Jenner. Caitlyn goes on to say that she would have continued with the marriage if Kris Jenner was a bit more understanding. Kris Jenner felt that she has been portrayed in a bad shape and had since excluded her ex from her life.  She did not include her ex-husband, Caitlyn Jenner in any of the three Instagram posts she uploaded for Mother\u2019s day. These posts were dedicated to her ex-husband, Robert Kardashian, her six children, and her mother. There was no mention of Caitlyn Jenner anywhere. Besides, her kids Kendall and Kylie Jenner with Caitlyn Jenner also did not acknowledge their father (now mother Caitlyn Jenner) in any of their Mother\u2019s day posts.  Caitlyn Jenner was spotted alone on Mother\u2019s day morning in a pink top, blue tight jeans, black sandals, and a black handbag. She had stopped at the Starbucks outlet in Malibu to pick up a coffee for herself. She was also sighted at a local fuel station pumping gas into her white SUV.  Similarly, she wore no smile on her face and stood there with folded arms. Later on Monday night, Caitlyn Jenner was seen at dinner time at a restaurant in West Hollywood adorning a black dress and matching heels. She preferred to use the back door to exit and drove her vehicle after leaving the restaurant.  However, unbothered by all the neglect, Caitlyn Jenner took to the Instagram media to pay tribute to her mother who is also celebrating her 91st Birthday. She wrote:  \u201cBig day for my mom today. Mother\u2019s Day and her 91st birthday!\u201d  The new mystery date  Two days after Mother\u2019s day, Caitlyn Jenner was seen coming out for coffee with a hot mystery blonde. Caitlyn was dressed in a black T-shirt and sweater paired with skinny blue jeans and ankle boots. They were walking down a set of steps together and Caitlyn looked quite comfortable in the company of her new female companion.  The blonde was in a white sweater and black jeans with holes cut out at the knees. Her feet were covered in high-heeled strappy sandals. Her long blonde hair was let down and straight. Caitlyn was sans her makeup and was in her Ray-Ban sunglasses to save her eyes from the Malibu sun glare. Will this relationship turn serious? We will have to wait and watch.  On the \u2018I am Cait\u2019 show, Caitlyn was seen with newly found friends in American actress Candis Cayne, transgender Chandi Moore, American transgender multimedia artist Zackary Drucker, author, and gender theorist Kate Bornstein, American author, and political activist Jenny Boylan, and high-school male-to-female transitioned Ella Giselle. On this show, Caitlyn also talked about dating and relationships. Caitlyn had said:  \u201cTo be honest with you, I can\u2019t see myself dating women in the future. I\u2019ve been there done that. I\u2019ve got three very strong ex-wives. I just don\u2019t see it.\u201d  She, however, is open to a new romance with a man. She said:  \u201cIf I was in a relationship with a guy, I would enjoy being treated like that\u2014opening doors for you, doing all what you think is the traditional stuff in a guy and a girl relationship. They have to be a very special guy to be able to do that.\u201d  She has been spotted with more women than men after her transition. She was seen with Kris Jenner\u2019s former best friend, Ronda Kaminhira in March 2017. Before that, she was seen at the Oscar night with transgender model Andreja Pejic. One will have to wait and see which sexual orientation Caitlyn Jenner ultimately takes.  There have been reports which allege that dismayed by the cold and negative reactions of her family, friends, and fans to her new look, Caitlyn Jenner has felt often de-transition back into a male. Only time will tell!  Short Bio on Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner is the former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion. Caitlyn Jenner is well known in the world as the Bruce Jenner who came out as a transgender woman in April 2015. More Bio\u2026  Share this",

According to Life & Style, Kris Jenner felt that Caitlyn's new book, \"The Secrets of My Life,\" portrayed her in a negative light and labeled her as less understanding. However, Gossip Cop has debunked these claims, as there is no truth to them.\n\nAdditionally, Caitlyn celebrated her first Mother's Day as a transgender woman without her ex-wife Kris Jenner. It was reported that Kris excluded Caitlyn from her Instagram posts for Mother's Day, dedicating them to her ex-husband Robert Kardashian and her six children. Caitlyn, on the other hand, paid tribute to her mother on Instagram, marking her 91st birthday.\n\nDespite the neglect from her family, Caitlyn has been spotted with a new mystery woman, sparking rumors of a new relationship. She was seen coming out for coffee with the blonde, who was dressed in a white sweater and black jeans.

The show stars Christina Hendricks, Mae Whitman, and Retta and follows three mothers who resort to robbing a supermarket in order to make ends meet.

        "doc_1_text": "It\u2019s hard to believe, but one of America\u2019s most famous families was never officially media-trained.  On Sunday\u2019s midseason finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim convinced her mom and sisters to meet with a communications coach so that they could each figure out how to answer the questions they tend to avoid during interviews \u2014 and no stone was left unturned.  Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Butt Heads  They document their workouts almost every day on Snapchat, but Kourtney, 38, and Khlo\u00e9, 33, decided they wanted to produce something a little more professional for their fans: a full workout video. The idea quickly took on a life of its own, and somehow, the two agreed to start a fitness line together as well \u2014 forcing Khlo\u00e9 to put her already-in-the-works athleisure line with her clothing company, Good American, on hold.  But Kourtney struggled to commit fully to the massive responsibility of the project, and soon enough, her sister had had it.  \u201cKourtney and I are a nothing brand right now. We\u2019re just not seeing eye-to-eye,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I love having a partner, but when you\u2019re just not in sync, it\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d  Eventually, she realized she wasn\u2019t going to get what she needed from Kourtney, who herself acknowledged that the two sisters have different priorities.  \u201cI was hoping you and I could do something together, but it doesn\u2019t really seem like this train is moving at the speed I want it to move,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cFor now, I think it\u2019s smart for me to move forward with Good American in doing this kind of stuff.\u201d  \u201cGo for it, girl,\u201d said Kourtney, admitting that she\u2019s not \u201cthe fastest-moving person\u201d and tends to \u201cprocrastinate.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re like Nate Dogg \u2014 you\u2019re only good for hooks,\u201d quipped Khlo\u00e9. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell your own album.\u201d  Media Training  After undergoing her own media training, Kim realized how beneficial it was and asked her family to give it a shot.  \u201cI just think it\u2019ll be a really good idea to get prepared and have everyone face our fears,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could ever be too prepared. It was so helpful for me just to be aware of the things I\u2019m saying \u2014 I don\u2019t think the answer is to retreat. You have be prepared that some day, you might be asked a question you don\u2019t want to answer.\u201d  After some coaxing, Kim convinced Kris, Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9 and Kendall to meet with two communications coaches from Clarity media training. (Kylie, whom multiple sources have confirmed to PEOPLE is pregnant and expecting her first child with rapper Travis Scott next year, has been largely absent from this season thus far and did not partake in the training.)  Throughout the session, the family underwent an on-camera mock group interview followed by individual ones, then re-watched the tapes to critique their answers \u2014 and suffice it to say that the coaches did not hold back. After opening their line of questioning by bringing up Kim\u2019s sex tape, they went on to cover everything from Kendall\u2019s Pepsi commercial to Rob\u2019s explosive behavior, forcing Kris and her daughters to answer some of the most uncomfortable and personal questions about their family.  For the momager, that focused almost entirely on her strained \u2014 and today, essentially nonexistent \u2014 relationship with her ex-spouse Caitlyn Jenner. After Kendall, 22, admitted that she and her sister Kylie, 20, \u201ckept a lot\u201d of their father\u2019s secrets over the years from Kris, she confessed that that was what hurt her the most.  \u201cThere were things that happened that they didn\u2019t tell me, because they were told not to,\u201d said Kris, 62, in reference to any signs that Caitlyn (formerly known as Bruce) wanted to be a woman.  \u201cI\u2019m not resentful about it, it just makes me really sad,\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a protective mom \u2014 I would do anything for my kids. And had I known some of the things they were experiencing \u2026 it just broke my heart, hearing some of that stuff.\u201d (Kris also said her ex\u2019s tell-all memoir was \u201cfull of inaccuracies.\u201d)  When asked about her protest-themed Pepsi commercial \u2014 which the company pulled days after it was accused of trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement following its release in April \u2014 Kendall prickled, but acknowledged it was definitely a \u201chuge learning lesson.\u201d  \u201cThere were a lot of things that were blinding me,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people I had faith in, a lot of things I had trust in.\u201d  After commenting on her defensive body language, the coaches suggested Kendall tackle the topic more directly in the future.  \u201cI have learned so much over the last four years of my career,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that the only person that\u2019s ever going to truly, truly look out for me is me. It is really hard work.\u201d  The coaches decided to ask Khlo\u00e9 about her reclusive brother Rob, 30, who is known to make headlines for his contentious relationship with his ex Blac Chyna, 29.  \u201cRob definitely wears his heart on his sleeve, and when he loves he loves really, really hard,\u201d she responded. \u201cWith that being said, when he gets hurt, he hurts really, really badly.\u201d  For Kourtney, the coaches focused their questions on her ex Scott Disick \u2014 and the mother of three flailed helplessly, giving up altogether at one point and laughing nervously. But ultimately, all of the women walked away from the experience with newfound confidence and knowledge.  \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t fun,\u201d admitted Kris. \u201cBut I truly do see some value in this whole process. We live our entire lives in front of the whole world and questions like this are going to keep coming for as long as I can foresee, so it really does help to have some skills under my belt to convey what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d  Kendall and Kylie Drama  Meanwhile, Kendall and her noticeably absent sister Kylie were going through some issues of their own. The two were trying to arrange a birthday party for a friend and wound up at each other\u2019s throats over their \u201ctwo completely different ideas.\u201d  In the middle of the media training session, Kendall stormed out, driven almost to tears over the situation \u2014 but within hours, they had worked it out off-camera.  \u201cIt\u2019s crazy because Kylie and I, there\u2019s always something,\u201d said Kendall. \u201cWe fought, and then she literally came over that night and helped me make a whole dinner for me and 20 of my friends. So we end up butting heads sometimes, but at the end of the day, she\u2019s my sister.\u201d  The spotlight on Kris  To cap off the episode, Kris decided to put her media training to use for an interview conducted by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for The Hollywood Reporter, answering questions spanning everything from the \u201csexual nature\u201d of her daughters\u2019 photos (\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable if they\u2019re comfortable\u201d) to their influence on plastic surgery trends (\u201cIf something \u2026 makes you feel better about yourself, then why not? I think everybody has to make their own choice.\u201d).  Her final word of advice for anyone squirming away from certain topics? \u201cExpect the tough questions\u201d \u2014 and have \u201csome sense of preparedness\u201d so that you feel confident in answering them.

The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book \"The Secrets of My Life,\" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 \"surgery was a success.\"  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had \"no regrets, none whatsoever.\"  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, \"I\u2019m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.\"  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been \"happy, peaceful\u2026all of that confusion has left me\u2026.I did the right thing\" -- and doesn't miss \"Bruce\" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how\u2014when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: \"When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.\"  As many know from her former reality show, \"I Am Cait,\" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, \"Yes, I did vote for Trump.\"  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, \"He wanted me to come play golf with him.\"  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  \"It was extremely disappointing\u2026you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,\" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is \"what's between your ears.\"  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  \"Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,\" commented the former \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has \"never been on a date\" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  \"I want to fight this fight,\" she vowed.

On Wednesday, PEOPLE confirmed Caitlyn will not attend her son's upcoming wedding to fianc\u00e9e Kaitlynn Carter.  Caitlyn, 68, \"has work commitments that have been set up for months and couldn't be changed in the end,\" a source told PEOPLE.  Nevertheless, the source said \"everything is good\" between the two, adding that Caitlyn \"will be throwing a big party for them when the newlyweds return to town.\"  And while there's no bad blood over the wedding, Brody and Caitlyn haven't always had such a smooth relationship.  Earl Gibson III/Getty  A Rocky Childhood  Caitlyn has long acknowledged that she was an absent father to her four oldest children Cassandra, Burt, Brandon, and Brody.  While the older Jenner children were not regulars on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Brody did open up about his strained relationship with his father on the show in 2013.  (Caitlyn went by Bruce before transitioning in 2015. She now goes by Caitlyn and uses female pronouns.)  \"I think Bruce is an incredible human being and I think that Bruce is a great father, he just wasn't a great father to me,\" he said.  Brody said Caitlyn and his mother Linda Thompson had a \"messy divorce\" when he was young, which created tension in the family.  \"I grew up with my stepdad,\" said Brody, referring to David Foster. \"Bruce was never around. I can't tell you how many birthdays went by where Bruce wasn't there. I resent him for that.\"  Brody's strained relationship with Caitlyn also caused a rift in his bond with sisters Kendall and Kylie. A source tells PEOPLE that Brody was \"never close\" with his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob Kardashian after Caitlyn married Kris Jenner.  \"He didn't spend a lot of time with his dad when his dad married Kris, so he didn't see them as much,\" the sources says.  And while Brody spent time with Kendall and Kylie when they were younger, they've grown apart.  \"As much as they love them, they're not close,\" the source adds. \"It's unfortunate.\"  Understanding Caitlyn\u2019s Transition  Before transitioning, Caitlyn battled depression and identity issues, which caused her to pull away from her family.  \"The big, formative years for them, I was really struggling with those issues [of gender identity],\" she said during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.  Still, she takes full responsibility for not being there for her kids.  \"There's no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems that you have,\" Jenner told ABC in 2017. \"No excuse for that.\"  And the former Hills star has remained supportive of Caitlyn's transition.  \"The first thing I thought was just like, 'It finally makes sense,'\" Brody told ABC in 2017.  In fact, Brody said he actually prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.  John M. Heller/Getty Images;  \"I've known Bruce for a long time and I didn't really get along with Bruce,\" he said. \"Caitlyn and I get along a little more, because Caitlyn is actually who she really is and she's living her life finally now as the person she actually was.\"  Brody said he was able to start fresh with Caitlyn and let go of his resentment toward his father.  \"It's like getting to know somebody \u2013 your dad \u2013 all over again, in a better way.\"  Brody's siblings have expressed similar sentiments about their father's transition.  \"In seeing him come out to me and explain his true self, I was more proud right then to carry the last name Jenner, to be a part of the family, than at any time before,\" said Brandon.  Rebuilding a Relationship  Both Brody and Caitlyn have been making more of an effort to spend time together in recent years.  In 2016, Caitlyn spent Thanksgiving with Brody and his siblings.  \"Thanksgiving with family is the best. And mine keeps getting bigger,\" she wrote. \"I hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!\"  In April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.  \"Caitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They're so happy for Brody,\" a source tells PEOPLE. \"Brody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.\"  Caitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.  \"Went to my first bridal shower,\" Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. \"I had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!\"  \"I'm so happy you were there!!!\" Carter commented on the post. \"It meant a lot to me!!\"",
        "generated_text": "Brody Jenner's strained relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner has been a topic of discussion for some time. The former Hills star has confessed that he never felt a close relationship with his father, Bruce, who was absent from his life during his childhood. This was due to the messy divorce between his mother Linda Thompson and Caitlyn, as well as Caitlyn's absence from the family during the formative years.\n\nHowever, things have improved between Brody and Caitlyn in recent years. The source told PEOPLE that the two have a good relationship and Caitlyn will be throwing a big party for Brody and his fianc\u00e9e Kaitlynn Carter when they return to town. Brody has also expressed his support for Caitlyn's transition, saying that he prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.\n\nKim Kardashian West, on the other hand, has lost all respect for Caitlyn after she slammed her mother Kris Jenner in her recently-released book, \"The Secrets of My Life\". In a recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim went after Caitlyn for making the intimate details of their marriage public. She also criticized Caitlyn for not caring about her mother. Her sister Kendall also blasted Caitlyn's memoir and called it \"insane\".",

After catching the world by surprise with his trade to the Detroit Pistons on Jan. 29, he now, has more shocking news being thrown his way. Former fling, Lolo Jones, 35, is slamming him as a terrible kisser. Yes, you read that correctly! The gorgeous Olympian took to Instagram to unload the big secret after a fan accused her of having a crush on Blake in the comments section of ESPN\u2019s Sportscenter account. She quickly shut the accusation down with, \u201cNah I went on a date with him. Worst date of my life and he\u2019s a terrible kisser.\u201d Yikes, I guess Blake doesn\u2019t score in all areas of life. We are uncertain of when their alleged date took place, but one thing\u2019s for sure, it was short lived.  The news on Blake\u2019s kissing abilities is not something we expected to hear, but it might explain why Kendall Jenner, 22, is relieved he\u2019s moving to Detroit\u2026.well, maybe. As we previously reported, Kendall was not too upset over his trade, in fact she thinks it will make it easier to move on. Blake and Kendall have only been dating for four months, so it\u2019s safe to say their relationship wasn\u2019t very serious to begin with. Besides being spotted out together a few times, neither Kendall nor Blake ever made their love super public or Instagram official. We can only hope his bad kissing reputation has nothing to do with it.  Nevertheless, Blake\u2019s trade to Detroit will be a huge adjustment. Blake, who is a father to two kids, Finely Elaine Griffin and Ford Wilson Cameron-Griffin, has spent the majority of his basketball career on the west coast. But being that balling is his passion, we\u2019re sure he will settle in just fine.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Lolo Jones slamming Blake Griffin as a bad kisser?

She recently revealed that she finds joy in her cellulite, stating that it makes her feel more feminine. This statement has stirred controversy, with some critics labeling her a \"blabbermouth.\" However, Jenner's comments may be a reflection of her desire to respect her body, as she has undergone gender reassignment surgery and has previously stated that she is transgender.\n\nJenner's comments come at a time when she has been in the spotlight for her transition from Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner. In 2015, she came out as transgender and underwent gender reassignment surgery. She is also a reality television star, appearing on the show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" along with her daughters.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding her comments, Jenner remains a beloved figure in the entertainment industry. She has been open about her journey and has used her platform to raise awareness about transgender issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Blake Griffin, a basketball player for the Detroit Pistons, has found himself in the midst of controversy after his ex-fling, Lolo Jones, claimed that he was a terrible kisser. Jones made the revelation on Instagram, after a fan accused her of having a crush on Griffin. It is unclear when their alleged date took place, but it was reportedly a short-lived one.\n\nGriffin, who is a father to two children, has spent the majority of his basketball career on the west coast. However, he has expressed a desire to move to the east coast, and his recent trade to the Pistons may be a step in that direction.\n\nOverall, Jenner and Griffin's comments highlight the complex and ever-evolving nature of celebrity culture.

        "doc_1_text": "Robert Bianco  USA TODAY      We\u2019ve come so far in 20 years \u2014 and the way Ellen DeGeneres came out helped get us here.  As her anniversary approaches, there is some danger in overstating the impact of DeGeneres\u2019 dual public announcement: literally on an April 14, 1997 Time cover emblazoned with the words \u201cYep, I\u2019m Gay,\u201d and figuratively two weeks later, in the April 30, 1997 \"Puppy Episode\" of her ABC sitcom Ellen. Culture and history seldom pivot on one moment alone, and almost never do so on the back of a single TV episode \u2014 even one watched by 36 million people.  Yet despite those caveats, there\u2019s little doubt that DeGeneres\u2019 decision to publicly embrace her homosexuality \u2014 and, with ABC\u2019s reluctant but eventual cooperation, to extend that embrace to her fictional character \u2014 was a watershed in how gay men and women are treated on TV. And over time, the lessons we learn from TV seep into real life.  Granted, Ellen Morgan was not the first gay character to enter our homes through our TV sets. Viewers had already seen Billy Crystal's star-making performance in the 1977 sitcom Soap as the long-suffering Jodie Dallas, though he had more on-air relationships with women than with men. And more than a year before Ellen\u2019s coming-out declaration, NBC's Friends had aired \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\" of Susan and Carol \u2014 transforming a couple who had initially served as a reflected joke on Ross into people in their own right.  Still, for the most part, gay men and women were as invisible on TV as they were in movies \u2014 making occasional appearances as characters whose tragic disgrace was linked to a hinted-at \u201clove that dare not speak its name.\u201d The most you'd find were asexual camp twists on the traditional \u201csissy\u201d stereotype, such as Paul Lynde\u2019s Uncle Arthur in Bewitched, or \u201cconfirmed bachelors\u201d like the one Tony Randall played in the 1981 series Love, Sidney \u2014 a character who had been gay in the TV movie that launched the show but was neutered once it went to series.  Then came Ellen, a slight sitcom that had struggled creatively for four seasons because it was stuck in a story-generating dead end: DeGeneres and ABC were not ready for the character to be a lesbian, but DeGeneres was uncomfortable playing straight. Finally, after many rumors and much buildup, Ellen Morgan came out in a two-part, late-season episode that cast Laura Dern as the woman who made Ellen realize who she was.  There was resistance: from advertisers, conservative advocacy groups, and so-called \"tolerant\" people who were fine with homosexuals as long as they didn\u2019t force their gay \"lifestyle\" upon them. An argument, by the way, generally made by heterosexuals who have no idea of how often they assert their own sexuality on a daily basis in the pictures on their desks, the conversations they have about their spouses or their children, and the way they interact. As well they should.  More importantly, in the fifth and final season, there was resistance from viewers, who began to wander away. Prejudice may have played some part (exacerbated by the ludicrous \"adult content\" warnings ABC slapped on the episodes), but the truth may be that a show as paper-thin as Ellen was not ready to carry the burden of a groundbreaking subject, particularly when sending a message seemed to become its only purpose.  The show disappeared, and DeGeneres\u2019s career took a hit, but the world did not end \u2014 for her, for ABC or for Hollywood. And because the world and the business went on, others were able to step forward, through shows as varied as Will & Grace, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Queer as Folk, Six Feet Under, Brothers and Sisters, True Blood, Glee, Modern Family and Sunday's American Gods \u2014 a Starz soft-core fantasy that takes us way past those first-step Will & Grace days when characters could be homosexual as long as no sex was involved.  TV's gay characters, before and after Ellen  In essence, it's a progression every minority knows. You\u2019re not seen at all, or you\u2019re so disguised, it\u2019s as good as not being seen. Then you\u2019re only seen at your perceived worst, as murderers, suicides, sex fiends, and other figures of tragedy. Slowly, progress comes \u2014 though that usually means, at first anyway, that you're only seen at what society thinks of as your best, or your safest.  The hope for all is that one day, you'll be accorded the same rights as the majority: To be seen as who you are, in full, and treated as well or as badly as everyone else. Which means for every wonderful, romantic love story like London Spy, you have to accept a sex-fest reality mess like Thursday's Fire Island, on Logo. Because that's the cost and reward of freedom.  And at least in part, we have Ellen \u2014 and Ellen \u2014 to thank.",

The source of that controversy also just so happens to be available for purchase at your nearest seller of fine books. It\u2019s Caitlyn Jenner\u2018s new memoir, and select Kardashian can\u2019t help but keeping talking about how very, very controversial it is.  The Secrets of My Life comes out almost two years after Jenner revealed she was indeed transgender and has undergone a process to confirm her gender (it\u2019s co-written by Buzz Bissinger, the famed sportswriters who also wrote the Caitlyn Jenner cover story for Vanity Fair). It details Jenner\u2019s experience struggling with her gender identity in private while living as a sports hero, an icon of American masculinity and then, of course, her very public transition.  Of course, Jenner\u2019s reality TV trailblazing family is mentioned throughout, and they clearly are very, very upset with it and don\u2019t care how many members of the book-buying public happen to know about it.  During an appearance that airs today on Ellen, one of America\u2019s highest-rated daytime talk shows, Kardashian klan lynchpin Kim discussed her displeasure with parts of the book that happens to have a suggested retail price of $30 but is available to buy now from several online and bricks-and-motor retailers.  \u201cMy heart breaks for my mom [Kris Jenner,] you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and [Jenner is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things,\u201d Kardashian , who has just shy of 100 million Instagram followers, told host Ellen DeGeneres, who has 44 million Instagram followers. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair, things aren\u2019t truthful.\u201d  Kardashian refers to claims Caitlyn Jenner makes that Kris Jenner knew she was transgender before they were married.  Kim Kardashian says that while she hasn\u2019t talked to Caitlyn Jenner for a few weeks ever since news of the contents of the book began to surface in advance of its release, as is standard for any high-profile celebrity memoir, she will always love her.  \u201cI feel like it\u2019s taken [Jenner] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now,\u201d Kardashian West told DeGeneres in a segment obtained by E! News before the interview aired. \u201cBut it\u2019s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.\u201d  Kris Jenner herself also reacted to the memoir on the family\u2019s long running reality show on an episode that premieres Sunday, just days before the book\u2019s scheduled release. \u201cNone of it makes sense! Everything she says is all made up,\u201d Jenner rants on national television about her portrayal in her ex-spouse\u2019s book. \u201cWhy does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?\u201d  Meanwhile, Caitlyn Jenner, who also recorded an audio version of the book, recently claimed on Andy Cohen\u2019s SiriusXM talk show that she hasn\u2019t talked to Khloe Kardashian in two years. This despite the fact that claim is contradicted by scenes from the family\u2019s reality show. Still, we are left to assume that Khloe is also very mad about the book, which is also available to download on your Kindle, Nook or other e-reader devices.  Of course, this all begs the question: Will anyone want to read something that apparently has caused so much highly publicized controversy within the Kardashian clan? The book may currently be number 28 on Amazon\u2019s best-seller list, but we can only imagine it might have climbed higher if not for this onslaught of negative publicity that all happens to coincide with its release.  We can also only hope that someday the wounds heal, and the extended Kardashian-Jenner family can someday reunite back into the family unit that supports each other\u2019s products and endeavors in perfect, publicity-optimized harmony.

The 49-year-old singer opened up about her trademark battle with Kylie Jenner over the name \"Kylie\" in a new interview with Rolling Stone, explaining that the dispute -- which she won in 2017 after Jenner attempted to trademark the name in 2014 -- was nothing personal.  \"I've never met Kylie Jenner.

Caitlyn touched down in London town last week to promote her to promote her juicy new autobiography The Secrets Of My Life (she even popped by the This Morning studios) and many are speculating whether she had a secret meeting with Celebrity Big Brother bosses.  Sources have told the Daily Star: \"The bookers are really keen to have Caitlyn in the house.  \"They know she\u2019d be TV gold so they\u2019re prepared to break the bank for her. The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn\u2019s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.\"  Well, they're not wrong there.  Caitlyn is no stranger to reality telly \u2013 she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait \u2013 and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.  She even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.  \"I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,\" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.  \"But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.\"  And staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.  \"My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things.  \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair, things aren\u2019t truthful.\"",

The singer-turned-actress is on the cover of People this month, where she spoke about her own mother, who identifies as a lesbian, as well as her two gay brothers.  \u201cNobody is hiding who they are,\" Moore tells the magazine. \"There are no secrets in our lives. I love and support my mom and my brothers with my whole heart. And nothing makes me happier than seeing anybody live their authentic self, and to choose love. If anyone can find love, I support it, I salute you and I celebrate that.\u201d  Moore, who recently got engaged to musician Taylor Goldsmith, first talked about her not-so-traditional family with the site Byrdie last year, when she shared that her mother left her father for a woman. But now that This Is Us is a bonafide Emmy-nominated hit, she's asked more often about her own family, whom she admits she can feel protective over.  \u201cI definitely won\u2019t stand for [intolerance],\" Moore said. \"But I feel like we\u2019re at a time in our culture when we\u2019re able to have a much more open dialogue. I\u2019m encouraged and excited that eventually we\u2019re going to get to a point where none of this matters. Sexual preference or orientation just won\u2019t factor in anymore. I think we\u2019re inching closer to that.\u201d  Moore's brother Scott lives in L.A. with his partner Ryan and used to work at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. Scott is now a podcast personality on AfterBuzz TV where he hosted the Looking after-show.  Moore's mom, Stacy, is still with her partner, professional tennis player Claudette Laliberte.  When Stacy first left Moore's father in 2008, The National Enquirer spread rumors that Moore felt \"betrayed\" and was at odds with her mother. Stacy herself told the Enquirer, \"It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business why we\u2019re together.\"",

        "doc_2_text": "The media campaign surrounding Bruce Jenner\u2019s public transformation into Caitlyn Jenner has been nothing short of masterful, from the substance of Diane Sawyer\u2019s two-hour \u201c20/20\u201d interview special in April to the sizzle of this week\u2019s Vanity Fair cover reveal of Caitlyn in a bustier.  The person guiding the strategy behind the scenes has been Alan Nierob, a seasoned showbiz publicist and longtime exec at Rogers & Cowan. Last fall Jenner hired Nierob, who has handled crisis PR for some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names including Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson, for help in guiding her through a storm of media attention as she came out as transgender. Nierob declined to comment on this story.  Sources close to the situation said Jenner turned to Nierob for a very specific reason \u2014 one that is poignant in light of the turns in Jenner\u2019s life today. In the mid-1980s, Nierob helped Jenner at a moment of crisis when a reporter for the New York Times was pursuing a story about Jenner being a cross-dresser.  At the time, Jenner was on the rebound from a career downturn and was enjoying a new round of endorsement deals and media gigs. In the mid-1980s, a story about the Olympic decathlon star dressing in women\u2019s clothing would have severely damaged, if not destroyed, Jenner\u2019s public image.  Jenner had previously been repped by Rogers & Cowan around the time of his 1976 Olympic triumph but never by Nierob. The two knew each other through mutual associates. In the early 1980s Jenner worked for ABC and NBC covering auto racing at a time when Nierob represented star driver Danny Sullivan.  When Jenner was approached by the Times with questions about cross-dressing, Jenner confided in Nierob about her gender dysphoria condition. Nierob was never formally hired as Jenner\u2019s rep \u2014 he helped her out as a friend. Nierob worked briefly but intensely with Jenner\u2019s then-manager and attorney to dissuade the Times reporter from pursuing the story. He used all the PR pressure tricks: strenuous denials, questioning the motives of his sources and emphasizing the ramifications of such a story for Jenner and his family. No story ever ran.  Thirty-odd years later, Jenner turned to Nierob for help on the journey to becoming Caitlyn because of the level of trust between them. Jenner felt Nierob never betrayed the confidence and never gossiped in Hollywood circles about the incident.  Work on the campaign to explain Jenner\u2019s transformation began late last fall when Nierob reached out to Diane Sawyer for what he knew would be a landmark TV moment for public awareness of the transgender community. He knew it had to be serious and substantive to dispel any suggestion that the emergence of Caitlyn was a publicity stunt.  Sawyer\u2019s work on the Jenner interview began at an emotional time for the ABC News anchor, following the November death of her husband, director Mike Nichols.  After the April 24 \u201c20/20\u201d interview generated rave reviews and 17 million viewers, the first promotion for Jenner\u2019s upcoming E! docu-series, which was officially announced during Sawyer\u2019s interview, began to hit.  The June 1 release of the Vanity Fair cover, which revealed Jenner\u2019s new name and look, coincided with the launch of her @Caitlyn_Jenner twitter account. Jenner racked up more than 1 million followers in a few hours, a new Twitter record, and had more than 2 million as of Friday.  On Tuesday ESPN announced that Jenner would receive the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the July 15 ESPY Awards. That will be followed by the July 26 premiere of E!\u2019s \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d which runs eight episodes. The series will chronicle Jenner\u2019s transformation over the past few months and also show her on a new mission to be an advocate for public understanding and tolerance of transgender community concerns.  In fact, sources said Jenner has been on the road this week shooting material for \u201cI Am Cait\u201d and hasn\u2019t had much time to catch up with the latest round of coverage.  \u201cShe\u2019s doing it,\u201d a source close to Jenner says. \u201cShe\u2019s not sitting at home reading her own press. She\u2019s on a mission to save lives and make a difference.\u201d",

The battle is ON!  Jennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson are two of American Idol\u2019s most famous alumni\u2026but they won\u2019t be on the show\u2019s judging panel when it returns to ABC next year. That\u2019s because both women are already booked as coaches on The Voice for seasons 13 and 14, respectively. So, now, Idol is going after Christina Aguilera, who\u2019s worked for six seasons on The Voice, as revenge. \u201cABC is ready to make a serious offer to steal Christina from The Voice,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThey are looking to pay Christina a lot and sell the fact to her that The Voice has forgotten about her. Idol is very much ready to make the move and hopes Christina bites.\u201d  Christina was one of the original coaches on The Voice, and served on the first three seasons before taking a break during season 4. She returned for seasons 5, 8 and, finally, season 10, when her contestant, Alisan Porter, was named the winner. After that, the powerful singer took some time off to work on her own music, and since J.Hud, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Miley Cyrus have already been confirmed for the upcoming season 13, we know she won\u2019t be back then, either. So far, the fourth coach who will join Kelly, Adam and Blake on season 14 has not been announced.  No American Idol judges have been confirmed just yet, although HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY heard that Katy Perry is very close to signing a deal. The show is also eyeing alums like Chris Daughtry, Fantasia and Carrie Underwood for the reboot, which will premiere in the first half of 2018.

The pop star and season-one \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d champion will join longtime coaches Blake Shelton and Adam Levine for the NBC talent-competition series\u2019 spring 2018 cycle. A fourth coach for the season has not yet been set. Jennifer Hudson and Miley Cyrus are already confirmed to be joining regulars Levine and Shelton this fall for the show\u2019s 13th season.  Clarkson had been in long-simmering talks about possibly joining \u201cThe Voice\u201d for an upcoming season. She was approached by the show multiple times in the past and had expressed interest, but had been unable to work its production cycle into her schedule.  Both Clarkson and Shelton are represented by Narvel Blackstock\u2019s Starstruck Entertainment.  Clarkson had been approached in recent weeks to join \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d as judge for its upcoming relaunch on ABC. The deal with \u201cThe Voice\u201d scuttles any possible return to \u201cIdol\u201d for Clarkson, who was the winner of the talent competition\u2019s first season in 2002 and appeared as a guest judge during the show\u2019s 15th and final season on Fox.  With season 14 of \u201cThe Voice\u201d set to premiere in February, Clarkson will likely be spinning her chair at NBC at the same time that ABC\u2019s \u201cIdol,\u201d expected to debut in March, is getting off the ground. The two shows could even find themselves going head-to-head. ABC has committed to roughly 40 hours of \u201cIdol,\u201d making it highly likely that the show will air two nights a week, as it did on Fox. According to sources, ABC is eyeing Sunday as one of those nights. The end of the spring cycle of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d in mid-March would open up Monday evenings for an hour-long weekly \u201cIdol\u201d results show. There it could face NBC\u2019s regular 8-10 p.m. episode of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d  In addition to being the first \u201cIdol\u201d champion, Clarkson is also one of its most distinguished alums, having risen to pop-star status on the strength of singles such as \u201cSince U Been Gone.\u201d Clarkson was also a judge on ABC\u2019s short-lived singing competition \u201cDuets.\u201d In addition to manager Blackstock, she is represented by CAA.  \u201cI\u2019m so excited to join \u2018The Voice\u2019 at NBC,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back and forth about a role as a coach for years, but the timing hasn\u2019t been right until now. I have always loved appearing on the show as an adviser or performer and established an amazing relationship with the network during my Christmas special. I can\u2019t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up-and-coming artists and provide them with the help and support they\u2019ve needed to break into the industry. Watch out Shelton, I\u2019m comin\u2019 to win!!\u201d  \u201cKelly has been a part of \u2018The Voice\u2019 family for many years as an adviser and performer. We are thrilled she has chosen to join us as a coach to mentor the next generation through our unique vocal boot camp,\u201d said Paul Telegdy, president, alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. \u201cEvery time Kelly Clarkson sings you are reminded what an incredible voice really is.

Blake isn\u2019t going to lose sleep over it, but he definitely feels like Luke is an amazing get for the show and Idol did it right by getting him.\u201d The American Idol re-boot had a lot of trouble locking down judges after convincing Katy Perry to commit, but at the last minute, they roped in Luke and Lionel Richie. The trio started filming auditions on Oct. 3.  Luke actually helped Blake out as a team advisor on season 12 of The Voice, but at that time, the season 13 coaches\u2019 panel of Blake, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson had already been set. For season 14, Blake and Adam will return with Kelly Clarkson and a still-to-be-named fourth coach. So far on the show, there hasn\u2019t been more than one country singer on the panel, so even though Blake was hoping for his pal to join, the possibility probably wasn\u2019t very likely. Now, it looks like the bros will be going head to head in the ratings when both shows air next spring!  Blake has a great track record as a coach on The Voice, and has won the show a total of FIVE times. He has some stiff competition this season, and his fellow coaches are ALL out to take him down, so things should get good as things continue!  HollywoodLifers, are you excited to see Luke on American Idol? Do you wish he went to The Voice instead?",
        "generated_text": "Blake Shelton, one of the coaches on NBC's The Voice, is disappointed that his friend Luke Bryan has joined the American Idol panel. While Bryan had previously been a team advisor on season 12 of The Voice, he was not part of the coaches' panel for season 13, which Shelton was hoping would include more country artists. However, it seems that Bryan was a valuable addition to American Idol, and Shelton acknowledges that he is an \"amazing get\" for the show. With Bryan's addition, it is possible that American Idol and The Voice will go head-to-head in the ratings when both shows air next spring. Meanwhile, Variety has learned that Kelly Clarkson will join The Voice as a coach for season 14, replacing Jennifer Hudson and Miley Cyrus. Clarkson was previously a judge on The Voice and is also one of its most distinguished alums. With Clarkson's addition, The Voice will likely have a strong presence on NBC's schedule in the spring of 2018.",

        "doc_1_text": "Along with the addition of Kelly Clarkson to the coaching panel, season 14 of \u201cThe Voice\u201d will introduce a block button and a save option to increase the competition factor.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t ever really had a defensive move or an offensive-defensive move, so we came up with the block,\u201d executive producer Audrey Morrissey says. \u201cIt really sort of speaks to the real competition.\u201d  The block button prevents a coach from adding a new artist to their team. The coaches this season, veterans Adam Levine and Blake Shelton as well as rookie Clarkson and season 12 winner Alicia Keys, can only use their block buttons on one artist for the entire first round of the competition. When a coach hits the block button with the name of the other three coaches, the coach who hit it automatically turns around. The \u201cblocked\u201d coach only discovers they are blocked if they press their button. If the coach doesn\u2019t press their button, the block is still available for another audition.  \u201cYou have to do it based on voice alone, so [we] really kept the sanctity of the blind audition with that,\u201d Morrissey says.  Season 14 of the show will also introduce a save button that will allow a coach to save an artist they just eliminated during the knockout round. However, if another coach presses his or her steal button, the contestant can then decide if they want to go to a new team or return to their former coach.  \u201cThe coaches love that because there was jeopardy. People didn\u2019t necessarily go back to the [team] they had been on,\u201d Morrissey says.  While these new competition elements promise to shake up the dynamic between the coaches, so does Clarkson\u2019s presence. Although she previously served as a mentor for Shelton\u2019s team, now she is joining the family full-time.  Chloe Kohanski, who started off as a self-proclaimed \u201cAmericana\u201d artist in season 13 but feels she developed a more \u201c\u201980s iconic rock persona\u201d that led her to win the season, says she has been inspired by careers like Clarkson\u2019s and previous \u201cVoice\u201d coach Jennifer Hudson \u2014 which were launched by a singing competition show. (Clarkson won the debut season of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d on Fox, while Hudson came in seventh during \u201cIdol\u2019s\u201d third season.)  \u201cThe mentality of this industry is that you have to shoot for the stars. You want the dream. You want to be a star. You shoot for that. But, there\u2019s so many beautiful places you can land even if you\u2019re not a star. You can sing for a living every day for the rest of your life. That\u2019s pretty beautiful to me,\u201d Kohanski says, noting that the contestants come into the show with talent, but the show provides the all-important exposure.  Kohanski also notes \u201cThe Voice\u201d develops important relationships between the contestants and their coaches that extend beyond the season.  \u201cIf I felt like I needed advice, or if I felt like I needed a favor, I would not hesitate to text or call [my former coach Blake],\u201d Kohanski says of working on her original music now. \u201cIt\u2019s a very real, organic relationship.\u201d  \u201cThe Voice\u201d season 14 premieres Feb. 26 at 8 p.m. on NBC.  Watch a preview of \u201cThe Voice\u201d season 14 below.",

Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.  Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.  Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, \"It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.\"  According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit \"Hollaback Girl\" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.  And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time \u2014 it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. \"I don't have any plans to come back,\" she told the outlet. \"I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.\"  The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.  The Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair \u2014 because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.",

Now she wants to see Blake, Adam (Levine) and the rest of The Voice stars continue to produce the best reality show on TV,\u201d our source adds.  This could end up being a tight battle. One thing that Idol has going for it is Katy has been making headlines for her antics while doing their nationwide search for contestants. In the two episodes that have aired so far, she already fell over and nearly flashed her hoo-hah under her super short dress. Then she literally stole the first kiss of a chaste young 19-year-old singer who had been saving the smooch for his first love. That kind of sexy behavior is getting plenty of buzz for the ABC show. It had a solid 10.3 million viewers when it debuted on March 11 so we will see what kind of ratings threat it will be to The Voice in the weeks to come.",

        "generated_text": "The American Idol reboot has been a hot topic of discussion recently, with rumors swirling that the show may be canceled due to poor ratings. According to an exclusive source, the show's failure to meet network expectations is largely due to the sexual misconduct allegations against host Ryan Seacrest. Despite being cleared by NBC, Seacrest's reputation has taken a hit, and his presence on the show is seen as a major turnoff for viewers.\n\nKaty Perry, the high-paid celebrity judge, is also believed to be contributing to the show's decline in popularity. The \"Firework\" singer's flirty behavior with contestants, including planting a kiss on Benjamin Glaze, has been met with disapproval from viewers. Perry recently spoke about the incident with The New York Times, saying that she was \"a tad bit uncomfortable\" and wanted to save it for her first relationship.\n\nDespite the negative buzz, American Idol has been renewed for a second season on ABC. Judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and host Ryan Seacrest will all be back for another round of singing competition. The current season will crown the latest winner on May 21. While the future of the show remains uncertain, it seems that its loyal fan base will keep the show going for at least another year.",

Sources say the negotiations were protracted due to questions about his complicated schedule and other commitments.  Seacrest served as host for the franchise during its 15-season run on Fox, which aired its \u201cfarewell season\u201d last year. The multihyphenate will continue to co-host and executive produce \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan\u201d from New York in addition to hosting and executive producing his iHeartRadio-syndicated morning radio show \u201cOn Air With Ryan Seacrest\u201d from Los Angeles.  \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to put into words what \u2018American Idol\u2019 means to me,\u201d Seacrest said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it\u2019s allowed me to experience. It\u2019s been an incredible journey from day one. To be asked to return this year, at my new home at Disney|ABC, is an honor, if not a bit surreal. I believe ABC is the perfect home for \u2018Idol,\u2019 and I\u2019ve every confidence the show\u2019s legions of fans will love it \u2014 especially \u201cIdol\u2019s\u201d best traditions of showcasing heartwarming stories, remarkable talent discovery, and, best of all, making dreams come true.\u201d  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said she attributes much of \u201cAmerican Idol\u2019s\u201d success to Seacrest.  \u201cWe are thrilled to be ushering in this new era of \u2018American Idol\u2019 with Ryan at the helm,\u201d Dungey said. \u201cSo much of \u201cAmerican Idol\u2019s\u201d overwhelming success can be attributed to Ryan, whose larger-than- life personality and laudable dedication to creating quality entertainment has made him a true master of his craft. His talent is limitless, and I can\u2019t think of a more appropriate person to honor the \u2018Idol\u2019 legacy as it takes on new life than the man who has been there through it all.\u201d  Variety reported in May that ABC, which beat out other networks to bring the singing competition back to the air, committed to broadcasting about 40 hours of the program \u2014 making it likely that the show will air over two nights most weeks, like it did on Fox.  Katy Perry joined \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d as a judge in May, becoming the first onscreen talent to board the reboot.  Live auditions for the reality series begin in August. The show returns on ABC in 2018.  \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d is produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, a division of CORE Media Group.

Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All  American Idol, once the biggest show on television during its heyday on Fox, has not been a runaway ratings hit in its return. The ABC incarnation posted a series of ratings declines after the premiere and hit multiple franchise all-time lows before recently rebounding with the start of the live shows. It also was regularly topped by rival NBC singling competition The Voice on Monday. Still, American Idol is on track to finish as Sunday\u2019s No. 1 entertainment broadcast series on each of its 8 telecasts this season in Live + Same Day Adults 18-49. On average, the series ranks No. 1 in its 2-hour slot with Adults 18-49, Adults 18-34, across all key Women and Teens 12-17.  \u201cWe knew that American Idol on ABC would unleash an opportunity for singers from all walks of life to realize their dreams and that these incredible contestants would have America rooting for their success,\u201d said Channing Dungey, president, ABC Entertainment. \u201cI am thrilled that Katy, Luke, Lionel and Ryan will be back to once again embark on this Idol journey with us to discover the next crop of inspiring talent.\u201d  ABC\u2019s pickup of the singing competition ended a long saga of getting American Idol back on TV when the network closed a deal last year with FremantleMedia North America and CORE Media Group\u2019s 19 Entertainment for a revival, two seasons after it ended its 15-season run on Fox. ABC then spent reported $20 million to lock in Perry as a judge.  \u201cAmerican Idol\u2019\u2019s return on ABC has shown once again that viewers love to discover and support raw talent,\u201d said Trish Kinane, president of Entertainment Programming, FremantleMedia North America, executive producer and showrunner of American Idol. \u201cOur new judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have brought huge credibility, energy and fun to the show this year, and we are so excited to continue the journey with Ryan Seacrest at the helm in the search for the next superstar.\u201d  Idol\u2019s relaunch on ABC was overshadowed by the sexual harassment allegations against Seacrest that resurfaces in the week leading to the show\u2019s debut.

Oct 20, 2017  AceShowbiz - Katy Perry seemingly doesn't want to get reminded of her enemy Taylor Swift any where and any time, including on \"American Idol\" revival. Now that she serves as one of the judges on the ABC show, the \"Swish Swish\" singer reportedly bans the contestants from singing any of Taylor's song.  However, a source explains to Naughty Gossip that it's not because she hates the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" singer, but because Katy wants to keep the spotlight on the show and the contestants. \"Katy wants the show to be about finding new talent not the ongoing drama between her and Taylor,\" reveals the source.  The source continues saying, \"If someone auditioning sings a Taylor song then the whole thing becomes about Katy's reaction, not the person auditioning.\"  Katy reportedly \"is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'.\" In addition, \"she's not exactly upset that people will be singing her hits and not Taylor's.\"  On the revived show, Katy will be joined by fellow coaches Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. Meanwhile, Ryan Seacrest once again will host the show, which previously aired on FOX for 15 seasons since 2002 until 2016.  Katy was the first singer tapped to be the judge for the new season with a whooping $25 million contract, before the show announced the R&B singer and the country crooner as the second and third judge. \"I am very excited to be joining Katy, Luke and Ryan on 'American Idol'. As a singer, songwriter and producer, I feel I can bring a great deal of experience to the table. It's going to be so much fun!\" 68-year-old Richie gushed in a statement. Meanwhile, Luke said, \"To be in a position in my career to help facilitate this along with the other judges is just a complete honor. It's gonna be a blast!\"  \"This is the dream team,\" the \"Bon Apetit\" singer gushed over her co-stars during an appearance on \"Good Morning America\", adding that the three of them clicked from Day 1.  \"American Idol\" is set to premiere in early 2018 on ABC.

With Kelly.  Today, Ripa, who has been hosting the syndicated show since 2001 when she joined original host Regis Philbin, announced her new co-host: veteran host Ryan Seacrest.  The television producer responsible for the Kardashian franchises started out on ESPN before moving to various game shows and smaller reality programs. He got his big break in 2002 as the host of American Idol, which made him a household name. In 2005 he began hosting New Years Rocking Eve, and in 2006 he started hosting E! News. He has previously tried his hand at daytime TV: On-Air with Ryan Seacrest, a syndicated talkshow, lasted less than a year in 2004.  Now, Seacrest, who earned $55 million last year, hosts a syndicated radio show for Los Angeles\u2019 KIIS-FM, in addition to having an overall production (and occasional hosting) deal with NBC Universal. His new hosting gig on an ABC shouldn't affect any of his production contracts (his Ryan Seacrest Productions produces shows for Fox, CBS and NBC), though we likely won't be seeing him on-air at the Peacock at the next Olympics.  \u201cRyan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\u201d said Ripa in a statement. \u201cI am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at \u2018Live\u2019 to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.\u201d  Rather than immediately replace Strahan\u2014who left abruptly without ABC giving Ripa or the show's executive producer much notice\u2014a series of guest hosts (including Seacrest) took turns in the hot seat next to Ripa.  The rotating hosts did well for ratings. The show, which is distributed by ABC's parent company Disney, maintained its spot as the number two syndicated daytime talk show behind Dr. Phil. In most markets, the show airs during the 9 a.m. hour and beats the third hour of Today. The show brings in an estimated $85 to $90 million for ABC thanks to ad revenue and license fees.  While Ripa may have been upset about the manner in which ABC handled Strahan's departure\u2014in an on-air statement at the time, she condemned the network for not keeping her in the loop about its plans\u2014she likely ended up with the long end of the stick, at least where money is concerned.  Prior to Strahan's departure, Forbes estimates that Ripa was making about $15 million per year from the show. (She made a total $17 million last year thanks to padding her income with endorsement deals). But after she was left in the dark about Strahan's departure and had to host the show alone for a year, she likely ended up with quite a bit of negotiating power when it came to her next contract, which will be in effect starting during 2017-2018 season. On top of that, without having to pay Strahan, the show likely had extra cash in its budget to pay her a hefty bonus for this past season.

        "generated_text": "The highly anticipated season 14 of NBC's reality TV series, \"The Voice,\" is set to premiere on February 26th, with Kelly Clarkson joining the coaching panel alongside returning veterans Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Alicia Keys. However, there has been a lot of speculation about whether or not Adam and Blake will finally take a break from the show.\n\nRecently, Gold Derby conducted a poll asking readers if it was time for either Adam or Blake to leave the show. The results were overwhelming, with 77% of voters responding that \"No! Adam and Blake are the only reason I watch.\" As one respondent put it, \"I can't imagine 'The Voice' without Adam and Blake. It would be a disaster if [they] leave the show.\"\n\nAdam and Blake have been rotating between the two chairs since Season 4, and they have coached nine of the 13 champions crowned on \"The Voice\" to date. Blake has mentored six champions, including Jermaine Paul, Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradbery, Craig Wayne Boyd, Sundance Head, and Chloe Kohanski, while Adam has won three titles, including the series' first champion, Javier Colon, followed by Tessanne Chin and Jordan Smith.\n\nThe two chairs have been held by other coaches over the years, including Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green, Usher and Shakira, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Hudson, and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nIn other TV news, Kelly Ripa's announcement that Ryan Seacrest will be the new co-host of \"Live with Kelly\" on Monday has lifted the syndicated daytime talk show to strong ratings. According to Nielsen data, the show delivered a 3.1 household rating and a 1.3 rating in women 25-54, making it the number one syndicated talk show on Monday in both measurements.\n\nRipa and Seacrest announced the surprise choice at the start of Monday's edition of the show, which Ripa has hosted since early 2001. Seacrest's move into the seat next to Ripa comes nearly a year after Ripa's former co-host, Michael Strahan, left the show for an anchor slot on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"Ryan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\" said Ripa in a statement. \"I am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at 'Live' to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.\"\n\n\"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" is distributed in national syndication by Disney-ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. The show is produced by WABC-TV in New York and executive produced by Michael Gelman, Ripa, and Seacrest.",

When cameras are off, the friendship \"seems forced,\" a source adds. \"It's not as natural as it once was. They've definitely drifted apart.\" This news comes just as The Voice experienced one of its lowest season premieres ever. Miley and Jennifer are also struggling to connect after Miley made a joke about JHud's long engagement to David Otunga. \"Jennifer looked Miley right in the eye and told her to never mention her private life again, or even say David's name,\" an insider explains.

Seacrest\u2019s move into the seat next to Ripa comes nearly a year after Ripa\u2019s former co-host, Michael Strahan, left the Disney-distributed show for an anchor slot on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d  \u201cRyan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\u201d said Ripa in a statement. \u201cI am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at \u2018Live\u2019 to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.\u201d  The move gives Seacrest, the multi-hyphenate host and entrepreneur, another big media platform. He will relocate from Los Angeles to New York for the \u201cLive\u201d gig, but will continue to host his syndicated daily drive-time radio show for L.A.\u2019s KIIS-FM and the weekly \u201cAmerican Top 40\u201d radio program. The plan is to build a radio studio for Seacrest at WABC-TV New York, where \u201cLive\u201d originates.  \u201cNot only is Kelly Ripa one of the most talented live hosts in broadcast TV; she\u2019s also become a very dear friend to me over the years. It\u2019s consistently been my privilege and pleasure to work alongside Kelly with all her incredible talents, charm and humor,\u201d Seacrest said. \u201cI\u2019ve been so fortunate in my career to be a part of some incredible TV programs, and I\u2019m excited to join daytime\u2019s top entertainment talk show, and most important, I couldn\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather share this new chapter with than Kelly Ripa \u2013 she\u2019s a dream broadcast partner, and I can\u2019t wait to start.\u201d  Seacrest served as a co-host with Ripa a few times during the past year, when \u201cLive\u201d had a steady stream of guest hosts while she took her time in selecting a permanent partner. His most recent stint on the show came on Feb. 27 with \u201cLive\u2019s\u201d annual post-Oscars edition. Seacrest will continue in his role as host and executive producer of E!\u2019s \u201cLive From the Red Carpet\u201d franchise, as well as his annual hosting gig on ABC\u2019s \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\u201d  Seacrest\u2019s move to \u201cLive\u201d comes a year after the curtain fell on the show that made him a household name, Fox\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Over the years Seacrest has parlayed his success on air into a business empire that includes everything from investments in digital media startups (including DigiTour Media, Pinterest) and marketing/PR firms (Civic Entertainment Group) to a menswear line with Macy\u2019s and an upcoming line of skincare products, Polished by Dr. Lancer.  Ryan Seacrest Productions (RSP) is also a busy producer of scripted and unscripted TV series, notably E\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d and its many spinoffs, Bravo\u2019s \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d and the NBC drama series \u201cShades of Blue,\u201d toplined by Jennifer Lopez. RSP will remain based in Los Angeles. The \u201cLive\u201d gig puts Seacrest squarely in business with each of the Big Four network parent companies. In addition to his deal with NBCUniversal\u2019s E!, RSP has an unscripted TV production pact with Fox\u2019s Endemol Shine North America and a scripted TV development deal with CBS Television Studios.  Michael Gelman, the longtime exec producer of \u201cLive,\u201d called Seacrest \u201ca master of live TV\u201d with the experience and chops to handle chores of daily morning TV.  \u201cWhen you combine those attributes with the talents and experience of the incomparable Kelly Ripa, you have two skilled and entertaining broadcasters, with great chemistry. Add in an experienced production team and a successful 30-year franchise and you have the perfect combination,\u201d Gelman said.  Getting Seacrest in place is a bookend to the drama that ensued after Strahan made his move to \u201cGMA,\u201d which angered Ripa as she was left out of the loop on the planning. The show that bowed in the late 1980s with Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford at the helm has maintained its strong ratings during the past year thanks to Ripa. Seacrest\u2019s high-profile in TV and visibility in other media can only be an asset to \u201cLive.\u201d  \u201cOne of the secrets to \u2018Live\u2019s\u2019 decades of success in daytime is the relatability of our hosts and their ability to deeply connect with the audience,\u201d said Janice Marinelli, president of Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. \u201cRyan has a charm and charisma that resonate with his devoted TV and radio audiences, and together, he and the remarkable Kelly Ripa will take \u2018Live\u2019 to a whole new level.\u201d",

Yes, we\u2019re talking about Ryan here.  The former American Idol host needs to spend a lot of time New York City in order to keep up with his co-hosting duties on the morning talk show\u2026 and he ain\u2019t pleased about it.  (ABC)  According to Radar, life in the Big Apple is not all it has cracked up to be for Ryan, and he allegedly yearns for the weekend so he can hope across the country to Los Angeles.  \u201cRyan is miserable,\u201d the insider dishes, adding that relocating to the New York City has been \u201cthe biggest mistake of his life.\u201d  Yikes.

The weather and the hustle of the city is too much.\u201d  Probably making matters worse is that the ratings are actually down 25 percent vs. last year for the show. Ryan will likely be feeling that he\u2019s party responsible for that.  (Getty)  Network execs don\u2019t like when ratings are down and generally try to get rid of the problem quickly. With Kelly as a long-standing host, it would make sense to keep her around.  Ryan, however, is likely expendable.  Kelly has been known in the past to not get along with her co-hosts, and if recent reports to be believed, she is not getting along with Ryan.  Another thing probably irks Ryan is that ABC is rebooting American Idol and he\u2019s very busy with Live. Word on the street is that he has been offered over $10 million for his hosting duties.  (Getty)  Seems like a decent salary, right?  Well, Katy Perry has been confirmed as the first judge and is getting $25 million for her services. That\u2019s a huge pay gap and considering Ryan has been on the show since 2002.  So, it seems like things are not working out for Ryan right now.  What will he do?

The star recently tried her hand at singing in a hilarious new segment for Live with Kelly and Ryan where she tried her hand at becoming the next Carrie Underwood or Kelly Clarkson.  Following in the footsteps of Today\u2019s Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford after they auditioned for The Voice, E! News reported that Ripa headed to the American Idol audition room to show off her vocal skills in a new clip, performing for judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Katy Perry.  The hilarious clip shows Ripa giving her best singing performance for the trio as she joked before heading into the room, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve mentally prepared for what I have to offer\u201d after claiming on the March 9 episode of Live that she has \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d  After getting a pep talk from her Live co-host, who\u2019s also presented American Idol since it first began back in 2002, Ripa made her way to audition and even asked Lionel to hold up her lyrics on a huge board so she didn\u2019t forget the words.  The star then launched into a unique performance of Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Do Right?\u201d as the judges watched on.  Following her audition, Katy told Kelly that she thought her performance was \u201cdifferent\u201d as Lionel awkwardly complimented the host on how she connected with the words of the song.  Other comments from the new trio of judges included describing Ripa\u2019s audition as \u201cspecial,\u201d \u201cspunky,\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to describe it, so I\u2019m just going to leave it at that,\u201d Katy then told Kelly after seeing her American Idol Season 16 audition.  But while it\u2019s safe to say that her American Idol audition inspired some mixed and confused reactions, Kelly did in fact land herself a golden ticket as the judges uttered the show\u2019s infamous line by telling the star that she was \u201cgoing to Hollywood.\u201d Ryan \u2013 who Kelly recently defended amid an allegation of sexual misconduct \u2013 then celebrated his co-host\u2019s big win with the crew outside the audition room.  But while Ripa probably won\u2019t be taking her singing career much further despite making it through to the next round, the morning host has made no secret of her love of the competition show in the past.  Back in May 2017, Ripa urged Seacrest to return as the show\u2019s host after it was announced that the series would be returning to TV after leaving Fox in 2016.  Speaking about the series\u2019 much-anticipated return before it was confirmed that Ryan would be taking back his hosting duties, Variety reported that Kelly joked on Live with Kelly and Ryan that she went into seclusion after it was announced that the show had been canceled because she was such a fan.  She then urged Ryan to return to the show shortly before ABC confirmed that the star would be back to his former role.  American Idol is set to debut its very first season on ABC, its 16th season overall, on March 11.",

Alicia Keys was similarly ecstatic. So was Kelly Clarkson. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The reason? Thanks to a new twist where the celebrity coaches can block each other from competing for certain singers during the blind auditions, Blake Shelton was barred from trying to persuade a powerhouse country singer to join his team.  \u201cI won\u2019t even be mad if you don\u2019t go with me,\u201d Levine told contestant Justin Kilgore. \u201cBecause one thing I know for sure that you can\u2019t do is go with Blake.\u201d  Kilgore chose Clarkson, as did Molly Stevens, another talented country singer during the second half of the premiere Tuesday. \u201cPeople believe if you\u2019re country on this show, that [only] Blake can help you, but that is not true,\u201d Clarkson said. The other coaches also tried to persuade Stevens to go with Clarkson, and basked in Shelton\u2019s disappointment. Clearly they play up this \u201cdrama\u201d for the show \u2014 although as Shelton took his losses in stride and joked about it on Twitter, there might have been some genuine frustration on his part.  Better whip my oxygen tank back out for @kelly_clarkson after that one. She definitely wore herself out tryin to be more country than me HA!!! Give her some time she\u2019ll recover. #VoicePremiere \u2014 Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton) February 27, 2018  So why was everyone determined to gang up on Shelton? As viewers know, Shelton has won the show six times, and four of those wins were with country singers. Shelton, one of the biggest stars in modern country music, is quite a draw for aspiring Nashville artists. But it\u2019s irritating to his fellow coaches, who frequently vent they never have a shot with great country singers, who eagerly choose Shelton during the blind audition process.  Advertisement  It\u2019s also annoying for the other coaches who want to bring their team members to victory, because country singers have an excellent chance of making it far on the show. Ever since \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d country music fans have enthusiastically voted on reality singing competitions. \u201cThe Voice\u201d is often criticized for not being able to produce stars, but the country acts who have won \u2014 Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradbery, Craig Wayne Boyd, Sundance Head \u2014 typically fare better than winners from other genres.  At a recent country radio conference in Nashville, when asked why country contestants do so well on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d the Swon Brothers (who landed in third place in Season 4) responded simply \u201cBlake Shelton.\u201d  Share this article Share  \u201cWe got his phone number, we have stayed at his house, we have hunted at his house. There\u2019s a personal connection, he goes above and beyond,\u201d Colton Swon said. \u201cHe\u2019s been like a big brother.\u201d  Advertisement  \u201cAnd he had our back when things got a little tricky,\u201d added his brother, Zach. The Swon Brothers got a record deal after \u201cThe Voice,\u201d though were later dropped, and are now releasing music independently.  Shelton\u2019s Music City connections have helped other team members; he gave Craig Wayne Boyd (Season 7 winner in 2014) a song he had been saving for his own catalogue, called \u201cMy Baby\u2019s Got a Smile On Her Face.\u201d Boyd\u2019s recording became the second song in history to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard country chart. Recently, Shelton took Sundance Head (Season 11 winner in 2016) with him on tour.  So it\u2019s no secret that Shelton will actively support a contestant\u2019s career, which makes him an appealing choice for auditioners. The show\u2019s producers obviously realize this as they amp up the drama, such as featuring Miley Cyrus\u2019s quest last season to beat Shelton and win with a country singer. (It backfired.) And this season, the coaches are banding together to prevent Shelton from hoarding all the Nashville hopefuls.  Advertisement  \u201cI blocked Blake. I did what I\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201d Keys said triumphantly after Kilgore went to Clarkson\u2019s team. \u201cJust the block alone gave me pleasure and satisfaction.\u201d  Read more:",
        "generated_text": "In a new twist on \"The Voice,\" the celebrity coaches were given the ability to block each other from competing for certain singers during the blind auditions. This led to Blake Shelton being barred from trying to persuade a powerhouse country singer to join his team. Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, and Kelly Clarkson all tried to persuade the singers to join their teams instead. This move was likely motivated by Shelton's past success on the show, as well as his connections to Nashville and the country music industry. The other coaches likely wanted to bring their own team members to victory, and were frustrated by Shelton's success on the show. Despite this, Shelton took his losses in stride and even joked about it on Twitter. The show's producers have also featured Miley Cyrus's quest to beat Shelton and win with a country singer in previous seasons, and this season the coaches are banding together to prevent Shelton from hoarding all the Nashville hopefuls.",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But backstage with reporters after the show on Tuesday night, Shelton made a big claim: \u201cI truly think Chloe can go on from here and become really the first superstar,\u201d he said.  Then Shelton quickly walked back his pronouncement a bit, saying that Kohanski could be \u201cthe first star that we\u2019ve had come out of this show that can have some hit songs.\u201d  \u201cI do think you can be a superstar,\u201d he added, according to a transcript from Hollywood Life. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying not to hex this thing.\u201d  Shelton\u2019s hesitation makes sense. \u201cThe Voice\u201d winners have notably had some issues becoming real-life music stars once the show ends and their recording contracts kick in. Some winners, such as Cassadee Pope, Jordan Smith and Danielle Bradbery, launched successful singles and albums. Others, such as Alisan Porter and Craig Wayne Boyd, parted ways with the label without releasing a record.  Advertisement  In the past, Adam Levine has blamed the record labels. After a contestant wins, they\u2019re assigned to a label within Universal Music Group, and executives take it from there. Levine complained in an expletive-filled interview with Howard Stern that \u201cno one knows what they\u2019re doing\u201d on the label side, which is frustrating when the show and coaches boost them so much on national television.  In a recent HuffPost piece about the trajectory of \u201cVoice\u201d winners, executive producer Audrey Morrissey echoed the same idea, in a much gentler way.  \u201cThere is choice amongst the label what they do with them, but we, as a television show, once they won, we\u2019re not necessarily personally involved in their careers,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cWe do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that\u2019s when it flips over to, really, the music business.\u201d  Chloe Kohanski, 23, won 'The Voice' Dec. 19, after her first coach, Miley Cyrus, chose to eliminate her in the knockout round. (Video: Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)  Kohanski is leaving \u201cThe Voice\u201d with as much momentum as one could hope for, with a string of Top 10 iTunes singles from the show and a loyal fan base that connected to her unique, psychedelic rock-inspired sound. She also has Nashville superstar Shelton as a mentor and a fan: \u201cIt would change music if she could get on the radio,\u201d he said Tuesday. Although Shelton\u2019s country colleagues might not necessarily help with her psych rock dreams, he\u2019s still very well connected in the city where Kohanski lives \u2014 and, until her appearance on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d worked in a coffee shop as a struggling musician.  Advertisement  Now we wait and see if Kohanski breaks \u201cThe Voice\u201d no-superstar curse. Either way, the show\u2019s ratings are stellar, as it still averages about 10 million viewers per episode. But with \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d coming back to ABC in March and threatening to steal some of the reality singing competition spotlight, it wouldn\u2019t hurt the show to earn some credibility and break a huge artist.  \u201cThe record company just needs to give her the platform. If they can really do that it\u2019s going to be easy,\u201d Shelton said after the finale, according to USA Today. \u201cIf we can\u2019t follow through with this thing, then WTF?\u201d  Share this article Share  Read more:",

Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine and country crooner Blake Shelton have been with the show from the start while current coaches Jennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson had each done a season before the current one. Is one of this foursome your favorite ever coach? Or do you prefer one of the other eight singers who have left the panel? Vote in our poll below and sound off in the comments section.  Hudson was first a coach last fall on season 13 of this Emmy-winning show. She proved to be unlucky in her debut, just missing out on a place in the final when Noah Mac was the last of the Top 8 to be eliminated. That season marked the sixth win for Shelton. One of his artists, Chloe Kohanksi, won the title while another, Red Marlowe, made it to fourth place. Levine was denied his fourth win after Addison Agen had to settle for runner-up status. The fourth coach in season 13 was Miley Cyrus, who had started out with both Kohanski and Agen on her team.  Clarkson, who was an advisor on Season 13, was a coach for the first time this spring. The first winner of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d used her experience on that reality competition series to mentor Brynn Cartelli to the win. She has strong opinions and held her own then against both Shelton and Levine. She connected with the other woman on the panel, Alicia Keys, who was back in the chair for a third stint, coming off a win in spring 2017.

On Monday, Kelly Ripa and ABC has finally decided to make Ryan her permanent co-host and it seems like the ripple effect of this decision has reached the backyard of the Kardashians clan whose life is being featured on E! thanks to the former American Idol host.  In fact, a source revealed to Radar Online that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians momager Kris Jenner is \u201cterrified\u201d for their future as KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest makes the big move.  \u201cOf course Kris is scared,\u201d the insider who was reportedly close to the family declared.  According to the outlet, Seacrest was the one who was \u201calmost single-handedly responsible for giving Jenner a spot on E! for KUWTK\u201d which is why his decision to leave Los Angeles for New York seems to be something that may also affect the reality TV show.  The outlet further explained Kris\u2019 fears, saying that the timing of Ryan\u2019s move could \u201cnot be worse for the money-hungry momager\u201d as less people tune in to watch the Kardashians go about their personal lives while on camera in Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Shelton and Clarkson shared some fun stories about the time they have spent together, and the American Idol winner revealed that she wonders why Stefani is with the country music superstar.  Clarkson says that the first time she was in Stefani\u2019s house, she felt like Julia Roberts in the scene from Pretty Woman where she walks into the store, and the women were like \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d  \u201cShe\u2019s such a style icon as well as this amazing artist,\u201d Clarkson continues. \u201cI literally talked to my husband about her house for hours. I was like, \u2018I felt like I was a good interior decorator, and then I walked into Gwen\u2019s house.\u201d  Then Clarkson made a joke at Shelton\u2019s expense, \u201cAnd then I\u2019m like, why is she with him?!\u201d  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  Shelton responded by saying that he has been wondering the same thing. The 41-year-old went on to admit that he was surprised that he ever received an invite to Clarkson\u2019s house and she has the biggest house he has ever seen in his life.  He then told the story about the last time he was at Clarkson\u2019s, and she started out the night in a white t-shirt, but after a few glasses of wine, it was tie-dyed shirt by the end of the night.  Shelton also joked that Clarkson\u2019s house proves that American Idol winners get more winnings than winners of The Voice.  The Since U Been Gone singer won the first season of Idol back in 2002 and has gone on to become one of the most successful singers in the franchise\u2019s history. But, Clarkson does admit that she does have one bone to pick with the show that made her famous \u2013 she never got her new car.  She says that Clay Aiken got a car even though he didn\u2019t win, and the show offered Carrie Underwood a plane. When Clarkson found out what Idol had given other contestants, she thought it was insane.  But now, Clarkson is on the other side of the reality TV game by switching from Idol contestant to the newest coach on The Voice. And fellow judge Adam Levine says that even though Clarkson comes across as a female powerhouse, she\u2019s a crier and wears her heart on her sleeve.  Shelton says that Clarkson cries so much there is a spray of spittle around her chair that you can actually see in the floor\u2019s reflection.  Judge Alicia Keys adds that Clarkson is genuine, honest, and completely in her emotions and feelings. But, it\u2019s not a tactic, it\u2019s just who she is.

Katy Perry, who will be joined by Luke Bryant and Lionel Richie in hosting the revamped competition series, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday to promote the show. During the appearance she told host Jimmy Kimmel she and Luke are thick as thieves, but it seems there's a rift between them and their 68-year-old co-judge.  'We respect him just about as much as his kids respect him. Which is not a lot,' the Roar singer said while appearing on the late night show.  Katy Perry fired shots at American Idol co-host Lionel Richie during Jimmy Kimmel Live!  The comment appears to refer to something the musician previously made about his youngest daughter, Sofia Richie, dating Scott Disick. It's been widely reported that Lionel doesn't approve of his 19-year-old daughter's relationship with the troubled 34-year-old.  Katy's jabs didn't stop there, however. Speaking with the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host she nitpicked the way Lionel critiques American Idol contestants. The award-winning musician said Lionel often recalls working with music legends in long-winded stories comparable to 'Ted Talks'.  Katy doesn't just make snide remarks behind Lionel's back, though. She and her country musician co-judge, Luke, have been known to play a prank or two on the legendary musician, according to her Jimmy Kimmel appearance. She revealed on the show that they put whoopee cushions on his seat when he stands up to provide feedback to competitors.  'We're ruining his legacy,' she said.  Before American Idol fans get too bummed about this on-set beef, it's worth noting that Katy also said during her appearance that Lionel is actually like 'an uncle' to her and her fellow judge.  'He's an uncle you want in your house telling you all these wonderful historical stories and he does have some tea but we can't put that on TV,' she said.  Although there may be no actual feud on the set of American Idol, there's plenty of other drama rumored to be going down behind the judging table.  According to TMZ, Katy's left American Idol executives 'frustrated' with her repeated late arrivals on the set during auditions. Per the publication's report, she's 'almost always late' by about 10 or 15 minutes.  Producers are also said to be worried about a lack of 'comedic tension' on the show. The outlet reported that the panel are 'not at each other's throats, either in a serious or runny way', which has created worries about ratings.

D.R., a 34-year-old Ohio resident, was left in the bottom two of the top 12 after a vote from the public.  He was left to sing for survival with a track he chose himself and went with The Temptations' 1972 hit Papa Was A Rolling Stone.  Birthday girl: Kelly Clarkson celebrated her 36th birthday on Tuesday with a live performance on The Voice along with her team members  'I'm puzzled why you're even in the bottom two. D.R you have the sickest range on this show, you have so much soul, so much rock and roll. Please America, for my birthday, vote D.R.,' urged Kelly whose birthday fell on the live show.  The Breakaway singer added: 'It's gonna be horrible if you make me cry on my birthday, because you know I'll cry. Don't make me sad, he's so good y'all. \u2026He can sing anything, don't miss it, open your eyes, open your ears.'  But D.R. was sent home after a final sing-off with Rayshun LaMarr, a 33-year-old Maryland man from Adam Levine's team.  Rayshun won the final vote with Tina Turner's I Can't Stand The Rain.  Survival song: D.R. King of Kelly's team was forced to sing for survival after finishing in the bottom two  Strong effort: The Ohio resident belted out the Temptations' 1972 hit Papa Was A Rolling Stone  The winner: Rayshun Lamarr also finished in the bottom two and sang Tina Turner's I Can't Stand The Rain  'You are a spectacular talent, that I happen to think is one of the best performers we have this season, it would be a crime if this dude didn't make it to the next week,' said Maroon 5 frontman Adam.  'Thank you so much for believing in me,' D.R. told Kelly before he left.  Rayshun told Adam: 'I'm thankful man, it's a blessing to have you in my life.'

In the end, we had our top 10:  \"American Idol\" contestant, Catie Turner, performs on April 23, 2018. Eric McCandless/ABC  Catie Turner -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Dennis Lorenzo -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Michael J. Woodard -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Jurnee -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Gabby Barrett -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Ada Vox -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Maddie Poppe -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Michelle Sussett -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Cade Foehner -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Caleb Lee Hutchinson -- Chosen by America  Michael J. Woodward on an episode of \"American Idol,\" which aired April 23, 2018. Eric McCandless/ABC  Here's how it went down:  There were two sets of chairs onstage: the Victory Zone and the Danger Zone. Over two hours, Ryan Seacrest revealed whether each contestant had been voted into the top 10 by America. Those who were voted through got to sing a song without being judged, and then take a seat in the Victory Zone. Those who weren't had to \"sing for their lives,\" and their fates were revealed at the end of the show.  Michelle Sussett, the first contestant in the \"Danger Zone,\" sang an original song called \"I'm a Dreamer,\" with lyrics in both English and Spanish, which made a powerful statement about the immigrant experience. \"This is my home and I love this country and I'm grateful to be here,\" the Venezuelan singer said. Judge Katy Perry was thrilled that she sang in Spanish, and she was the one who announced that she'd been chosen for the top 10.  Marcio Donaldson sang \"Jealous\" by Nick Jonas and it wasn't his best performance. You could tell from the judges' comments that there was no way they were putting him through.  Garrett Jacobs sang \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival and, though Perry said it was the best he'd ever sounded, he wasn't chosen.  Dennis Lorenzo sang Maxwell's version of the Kate Bush song \"This Woman's Work.\" Perry called the performance \"brilliant\" and \"dynamic\" and said she'd fight for him; Lionel Richie said he didn't know what America was thinking by not putting him through. Luke Bryan was the one who announced he'd been chosen for the top 10.  Jonny Brenns sang a compelling version of \"Demons\" by Imagine Dragons that got him a standing ovation from the judges; Perry praised him for looking like a rock star, but criticized him for not having enough stage presence. In the end, he failed to make it through.  Mara Justine sang \"Love on the Brain\" by Rihanna, which made Bryan say he was \"in shock\" that she wasn't voted through by America. But Perry told the young teen that sometimes it's just about timing, which was a big giveaway that she wasn't going to be chosen.  Jurnee sang \"Never Enough\" from \"The Greatest Showman.\u201d Richie simply said, \"I love you\" and he announced that they'd picked her for the top 10.  Ada Vox was the last contestant to sing for their lives, and sang \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,\" so memorably delivered by \"American Idol\" alumna Jennifer Hudson in \"Dreamgirls.\"  To say Vox brought the house down is an understatement; after the performance, Perry took off her earrings and announced that she and the other judges were making an executive decision: They ordered Vox to go to the Victory Zone immediately.  After Vox was chosen, the remaining seven contestants had to wait to hear which three would be staying. After Jurnee, Dennis and Michelle were declared the lucky ones, the rest of the pack were told by Perry, \"Over 10 million people are watching this. So what are you going to do with that information? You're going to launch off on your own.\"  The top 10 will perform Disney's greatest hits Sunday, and there will be the first-ever, coast-to-coast, live vote, with the results coming at the end of the show.",

Fortunately for 16-year-old Chevel\u2014who continues to stun viewers week after week\u2014host Carson Daly called her name, securing her spot in the top 10.  The Voice The Voice STREAM NOW  Kelly was, of course, thrilled that Chevel was moving forward, and immediately hopped up to give the young artist a big hug\u2014and some reassurance.  \u201cIt\u2019s not in any order,\u201d she quickly told Chevel, who fanned herself as she joined her coach. Chevel responded, \u201cOK,\u201d and then told Kelly, \u201cLove you!\u201d (See the sweet moment at 29:01 here.)  Kelly clearly wanted her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to understand that she shouldn\u2019t take her standing on the elimination show to mean she\u2019s in last place in the voter\u2019s hearts. And Kelly\u2019s not the only one who reached out to the talented teen to let her know she\u2019s a front-runner in the competition.  Sadly, Kelly didn\u2019t win all around on Tuesday. After performing Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cTattooed Heart,\u201d Lynnea (who caused quite the controversy when she joined the series from the Comeback Stage this year) was sent home, and DeAndre Nico from Team Adam Levine moved on in her place. But despite losing Lynnea, Kelly still has three powerhouse performers on her side. Blake Shelton might be calling her Queen Kelly for another year, after all!",

        "doc_2_text": "Folks who didn\u2019t watch the VMAs on Sunday because they were too busy watching relatives bone on Game of Thrones or escaping rising floodwaters, answer this: What did you hear, after-the-fact, about Katy Perry?  Katy Perry was the host, and she was just \u2026 not overwhelming. No huge controversies, sure, but not even Katy\u2019s terrible opening monologue was especially memorable.  That\u2019s a problem for Katy, but it might be an even bigger problem for American Idol producers, who are reportedly very concerned that they\u2019re paying $25 million to Katy Perry to be a judge only for her to flop.  On Sunday, I had friends over, and they mentioned that traffic was especially slow near my home.  Why? Because American Idol auditions were in town.  Yes, in case you\u2019ve managed to forget, American Idol is coming back, like some archetypal horde that people thought had been defeated.  The biggest stir of publicity about it is Katy Perry\u2019s salary of $25 million.  Don\u2019t get us wrong, she\u2019s a big-time celebrity who\u2019s hosted the Superbowl, which is probably what the American Idol producers and the network were thinking when they hired her.  What they clearly weren\u2019t thinking about:  One, that Katy Perry was singing for her Superbowl Halftime show, which is very different from sitting at a table and talking and judging.  Two, that Katy Perry was pretty famously upstaged at that show by Left Shark. You didn\u2019t forget Left Shark, did you?  (Getty)  Well now, RadarOnline is reporting that ABC higher ups and American Idol showrunners are worried that they made a mistake by hiring Katy Perry to be a judge.  It sounds like they\u2019re panicking, actually.  RadarOnline\u2018s source reports that her lackluster hosting over the weekend is what has them so concerned.  \"They are paying her $25 million and she was a total dud [on the VMAs].\"  You might be wondering how they didn\u2019t catch it earlier, right?  Here\u2019s how:  \"No one ever auditioned her for the new Idol job and they are freaking out that they hired someone who is terrible on live television.\"  Oh dear!  (MTV)  Usually, if you get a job without applying for it (or auditioning, in this case), it\u2019s because someone who\u2019s seen your work up close before (maybe a coworker or a former boss) is either doing the hiring or has vouched for you.  It sounds like Katy was just offered the gig, sight unseen.  ABC had already had concerns, RadarOnline had previously reported, that Katy Perry might upstage contestants.  (Like Mariah Carey)  Or that she might just need to tone down \u2026 not her look, but her very attention-grabbing personality.  (As far as we can tell, that\u2019s not a euphemism for her boobs)  Judges are supposed to evaluate contestants, not overshadow them.  (Getty)  Now, though, it sounds like ABC and American Idol are afraid that Katy\u2019s just going to fall flat like she did at the VMAs.  Just because someone is good at singing and performing doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re good at talking on camera.  Similarly, like, just because someone\u2019s great at giving interview or interviewing people doesn\u2019t mean that they have a dazzling singing voice or would make an amazing performer.  This should be a lesson to us all, we suppose: make sure that you hire the best and most highly recommended babysitter or dog-walker or whatever. Not just the one who happens to be hot.",

Two sources with knowledge of the deal confirmed the news to CNN prior to Monday's broadcast, on which Ripa and Seacrest broke the news to viewers.  \"Today, the next chapter of the 'Live' story is about to be written,\" Ripa said.  Ripa thanked all of the temporary co-hosts who had filled in during the search, saying, \"They are a part of the 'Live' family forever.\"  She then increased the anticipation by going to commercial break before bringing Seacrest on stage.  \"So happy,\" Seacrest said as he embraced Ripa before the audience. \"So exciting.\"  Seacrest, one of the world's best-known broadcasters, has co-hosted \"Live\" five times as a guest since ABC began the search for Michael Strahan's replacement one year ago.  \"Live\" gives Seacrest, the former host of Fox's \"American Idol,\" a new daily platform on network television. He will also be an executive producer on the show, according to The Hollywood Reporter, giving him at least nominally the same level of power over it that Ripa herself has.  The beloved talk show airs in many markets at 9 a.m., directly against the third hour of NBC's \"Today.\" In the fall NBC is introducing a new 9 a.m. show led by Megyn Kelly, who recently jumped from Fox News to NBC.  Five years ago Seacrest was seen as a contender for a \"Today\" show co-host job. Instead, Ripa and Seacrest will be competing with Kelly.  \"Live\" is based in New York. Seacrest lives in Los Angeles, but he has a home in Manhattan, and he's moving to New York to start the new job.  Seacrest is already one of the busiest people in the media business. The new hosting gig will not affect other on-air and off-air roles. He recently renewed his contract to host red carpet specials for NBCUniversal's E! network, for example.  Seacrest will continue to lead his nationally syndicated radio shows for iHeartMedia. According to a source, the ABC building that houses \"Live\" will also have a new radio studio for Seacrest.  Seacrest is already in business with ABC as the host of \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" on New Year's Eve.  The hosting deal may open the door for further business deals with ABC's parent company, Disney.  The seat next to Ripa was coveted by dozens of entertainment and news industry A-listers.  The search began when Strahan abruptly left the show for \"Good Morning America\" after co-hosting alongside Ripa for four years. Ripa was reportedly blindsided by the news. Strahan told her about it barely half an hour before the news leaked in the press.  Since then, Ripa's guest co-hosts have included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Jerry O'Connell, and Fred Savage.  Ripa took to Twitter on Sunday to tell her followers that she would reveal her new co-host during Monday's show.  Representatives for Ripa, Seacrest and ABC either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment ahead of the official announcement on Monday.",

Seacrest, who was previously the host of \"American Idol,\" will also serve as an executive producer on the show, giving him at least the same level of power as Ripa.

On September 27, Radar Online shared a report with readers, claiming that Ryan Seacrest\u2019s wild life in the Big Apple may be causing a divide in his relationship.  While Ryan Seacrest and Shayna Taylor were seen frequently on the streets of New York City after their move from the west coast, Radar Online claims that Taylor isn\u2019t currently living with her boyfriend full-time. Instead, the outlet suggested that Taylor was spending the majority of the time in Los Angeles, where she was recently seen enjoying time with her girlfriends.  According to an insider, Ryan Seacrest sprung the move to New York City on Shayna Taylor and while she may have been on board with the relocation at first, she opted to keep her home in Los Angeles as he adjusts to life on the east coast.

Although the report suggested that Ryan Seacrest and Shayna Taylor may be on the brink of a split, other reports have suggested that they could soon get engaged.

(Frederick M. Brown / Getty Images)  It's officially happening: After going dark in 2016 on Fox, \"American Idol\" will be back on your television sets.  The singing competition show that once reigned as ratings king will air on ABC for the 2017-2018 season, the network announced Tuesday, following rumors of its return that surfaced last week.  Advertisement  \"'American Idol' is a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon,\" Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, said in a statement.  It's not clear who will serve as host or on the panel of judges. ABC said an announcement would come later, but one name is obviously swirling about: Ryan Seacrest.  Advertisement  The former \"Idol\" host has a jam-packed work schedule these days, including a new gig he started this month: serving as Kelly Ripa's co-host on ABC's \"Live,\" the second-most watched daytime TV show. On Monday, Ripa asked Seacrest on air about the reports that \"Idol\" would return.  \"I said at the end of the series, 'Goodbye for now,' hoping it would come back,\" Seacrest told her. \"It was rumored to be going to other networks. I had no idea that it was being talked about to come here until late last week. I saw some rumor in the news, so I made a phone call, and they said, 'Yeah it may actually end up here,' and I said, 'That'd be good to know, since I work here.\"  But, he added, \"I don't know if I can host,\" given the preparation he has to do every night to be ready for \"Live.\" Ripa cut him off -- \"Yes, you can!\" -- and said that the morning after \"Idol\" shows, \" you won't even have to think, I will do it all!\"  Seacrest had been based in Los Angeles, but announced he'd move to New York City for the \"Live\" job and continue his other commitments out of studios there. He's still a staple radio presence, hosting \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\" every weekday morning and \"American Top 40\" on the weekends.  Oh, and Seacrest will continue to interview celebrities before all award shows on the E! red carpet; host \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest\" on Dec. 31; and executive produce the E! Kardashian empire shows.  But how much Seacrest is too much Seacrest? He was a constant, but not a standout presence on \"Idol\" -- which is why he was so good at the job, The Washington Post's Emily Yahr wrote last year.  \"Sometimes, you just forget he's there. That's intentional, and really, the mark of an excellent host,\" she wrote. \"Move the proceedings along; banter with contestants; throw in a quip or two; and make it look so easy that no one realizes how hard you're working.\"  \"It's not that he's multi-talented; he's anti-talented, not a performer but a professional 'personality,' the latest variation on a type as old as broadcasting: the guy who stands there and introduces the acts,\" former Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote in a 2008 profile of Seacrest. \"He's a low-key cheerleader who keeps the show moving and, with the judges as natural foils, allies himself with the audience and the contestants, never threatening to upstage the performers, even if he could.\"  Advertisement  \"Idol\" was a ratings juggernaut in its early years -- at times, it was America's most-watched show -- but the numbers dropped toward the end of the series' run. At its peak, it drew more than 30 million viewers. But by its 15th season, that number hovered around 9 million.  Still, the show had a profound and lasting influence on pop culture, shaping public perceptions of what qualified as \"good singing\" and ushering in a new era of reality TV shows, particularly competition shows (\"The Apprentice\" debuted two years after \"Idol\"). The show also helped launch singing careers -- Jennifer Hudson, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Adam Lambert, etc. -- and past contestants have collectively netted 14 Grammys, two Golden Globes and an Oscar.  Clearly, ABC sees massive potential in trying to recapture some of that magic, even if the playing field of reality TV remains crowded. NBC has aired its own singing competition show \"The Voice\" since 2011, and ABC is home to \"The Bachelor\" and \"Dancing with the Stars.\"  \"All of the intense \u200especulation surrounding the comeback of 'American Idol' demonstrates just how popular and powerful this brand remains,\" Peter Hurwitz, CEO of Core Media CEO, which produces \"Idol,\" said in a statement. \"ABC shares our belief in the enduring value of 'Idol' and will provide us with the perfect new home to showcase the gold standard of singing competition shows.\"  RELATED STORIES:  NBC in talks to revive 'American Idol'  Advertisement  'American Idol' exits with largest finale audience in three years  How former Chicago-area contestants said goodbye to 'American Idol'",

Now get ready for Ryan Seacrest to be a fixture on the morning-show circuit as Kelly Ripa's new partner.  Nearly a year after Michael Strahan left his seat next to Ripa on her weekday talk show, she announced that former American Idol host Seacrest is her new co-host. And so Live With Kelly has become Live With Kelly and Ryan.  The popular morning show with Ripa is distributed by Disney | ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. It is produced by WABC-TV in New York and competes in many markets against the third hour of NBC's Today. Seacrest, whose industry credits includes both television and radio gigs as well as producing reality TV series, is not new to ABC as he is host of the network's annual broadcast of Dick Clark's Rockin Eve on New Year's Eve.  CNN reported the Seacrest news ahead of Monday's show. It was confirmed early during Live's broadcast. The two appeared together and he told her, \"So happy. So excited.\"  But she's suffered without a permanent co-host: Ratings for Live! are down 18%, to an average of 3.2 million viewers, a steeper decline than any other syndicated talk show.  Ripa posted a video to Twitter on Sunday afternoon in which she took a sip from a Live with Kelly mug that also included a question mark. She said in the video, \"Tune in tomorrow. Trust me.\"  The show said it was \"growing to two\" on Twitter. Another post had \"announce co-host\" on Ripa's \"to do\" list.  News of Strahan's exit for Good Morning America last May led Ripa to skip the show for two days in protest of the way the situation was handled.  Numerous celebrities have filled in as co-hosts with Ripa over the past year, including Jerry O'Connell, Fred Savage and Andy Cohen.  Contributing: Erin Jensen and the Associated Press",

Simply put, there are just too many obstacles for the Oscar winner and the country superstar to overcome. During the course of their union, the two 50-year-old Australia natives have struggled to deal with Keith's addiction issues \u2014 he went to rehab four months after they wed in 2006 \u2014 as well as Nicole's anger over rumors of his infidelity. The couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, \"have been fighting constantly over Nicole's incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,\" added the insider. \"They have been putting a Band-Aid over their problems for too long. While they have smiles plastered on their faces in public, in private, things have been falling apart.\"  The counseling trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. \"It was Keith's idea to visit the boot camp,\" the insider said. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. \"He gave her an ultimatum,\" the source said. And she knew he wasn't bluffing. The insider said their recent fights have gotten so bad that Keith has even left their Nashville home to stay overnight at a hotel. \"It's become a second home for him. Of course, there have been times she's given up and walked out on him, too,\" the source revealed. But in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. \"They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,\" the insider explained. They both opened up. \"Keith said he couldn't continue to live in a marriage where he felt like he was being constantly monitored like one of her children,\" the source shared. \"And Nicole ended up breaking down and spilled her heart out about how past relationships had damaged her, and she vowed to make a conscious effort to change things.\" The nearly weeklong retreat was intense. Said the insider, \"At one point it was touch-and-go whether they'd even leave together.\" They ultimately did, and yet it didn't work \u2014 their problems still remain.  Nicole and Keith struggled from the outset of their union. When the \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" singer moved to Nashville from Australia in the '90s, drugs \"were my thing,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2016. \"I loved them.\" By the time he met Nicole in 2005, he was seven years sober following a rehab stay in 1998. But he relapsed shortly after their 2006 wedding and checked into Betty Ford. Nicole was devastated. \"It was very, very hard to have to have her go through that,\" Keith later said. Nicole publicly stood by his side (and even hopped on a flight from Europe to be with him when she heard the news), but it was a struggle. \"It was just another twist in my life: Here it goes. Hold on, and off we go! But it was painful, deeply painful,\" she admitted to Vanity Fair in 2007. \"We were in a very, very, very bad, painful place, and have managed to step through it.\" Other problems soon replaced that one. In 2015, Keith was photographed hanging out with his opening act, fellow country singer Kelsea Ballerini, 24, on his tour bus. The photos left Nicole furious. \"She calls him out every time he's pictured with another woman,\" according to a friend. \"Keith is constantly defending himself from rumors of on-tour affairs with groupies and female singers.\"  Nicole \u2014 who attended this year's Oscars alone because Keith had a concert \u2014 has even admitted to keeping close tabs on him when they are apart. \"I don't like it when my husband doesn't answer his phone. I have to keep calling and calling, and I get anxious. Does that make me high-maintenance?\" she told W Magazine in 2017. Around the same time, Keith became the jealous one. A source said he became furious when he learned that Nicole pushed to get Zoe\u0308 Kravitz \u2014 the daughter of Nicole's ex-fiance\u0301 Lenny Kravitz \u2014 hired on her HBO series Big Little Lies. \"Keith feared she may still have feelings for Lenny,\" said the source. \"Nicole kept telling Keith that Zoe\u0308 is like family and it was a mutual decision between the producers that she was right for the part. Lenny had nothing to do with it, but Keith didn't care.\" Story continues after video",

On Friday, that included a tearful no-holds barred chat with Dr. Siri Sat Nam Singh, host of Viceland\u2019s The Therapist, which airs every Monday at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT. Together, the two discussed Perry\u2019s desire to be live an more genuine life \u2014 something she\u2019d been inspired to do after drawing an \u201cauthenticity\u201d card from a desk of inspirational Angel Cards in the wake of her last album, 2013\u2019s Prism.  Katy Perry/Youtube  Attempting to leave behind the heightened pop persona that catapulted the \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d singer into stardom, Perry told Dr. Singh that she often feels divided between \u201cKaty Perry, pop star\u201d and \u201cKatheryn Hudson,\u201d the \u201cdork\u201d her family and close friends know.  The dichotomy is part of the reason Perry decided to embark on such a drastic pixie haircut. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like Katy Perry anymore,\u201d she said \u2014 adding that the haircut had provoked hate and abuse from users on social media.  \u201cI\u2019m a bit more nerdy than everybody thinks I am, I\u2019m a big goofball.

I just want to be loved.\u201d  Katy Perry. Britta Pedersen/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa /MediaPunch  \u201cHonestly, I was [surprised] for an artist of that magnitude to be so open and vulnerable,\u201d Dr. Singh tells PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m really having that experience with the majority of people that I work with because I think that I create a safe space for them to be themselves where I\u2019m not judging them.\u201d  After the session, Perry \u201cactually said \u2018thank you for having such a safe space,'\u201d he adds. \u201cThe whole session was about the dichotomy of the conflict between her professional persona of Katy Perry and her individual human life of Katherine Hudson. At the end, she said that she was going to integrate them.\u201d The special one-hour episode of Katy Perry on The Therapist will air on June 19 at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT on Viceland.

You\u2019re not under oath. You don\u2019t have to leave bread crumbs all over social media if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Perry continued. \u201cBut some people do that and need that and it\u2019s a tool. Listen, all the fame stuff is just a bi-product of what I do, it\u2019s not what I sought out to do. I just wanted to tell stories and sing and connect with people.\u201d  Her comment about her personal life comes days after she and ex Orlando Bloom fueled reconciliation rumors after they were snapped by fans enjoying a meal together in the Maldives.  Frederick M. Brown/Getty  However, the pair is not officially back together and are very much still friends, a source close to Bloom, 40, told PEOPLE recently.  \u201cOrlando and Katy were traveling separately over the holidays and met up in the Maldives after,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey have fun and love seeing each other, but it\u2019s nothing serious. They are not officially back together.\u201d  Dave M. Benett/VF17/WireImage  While Perry admitted that she does not abstain from social media, it\u2019s not her main priority.  \u201cI love movies. I love traveling. I love culture. I love modern art museums. But I\u2019m just like anyone, I scroll,\u201d she said on Monday.  Meanwhile, the Grammy-nominated star remains focused on her career and making music that will inspire her fans.  \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to keep it spicy for sure. Especially with young people their attention spans and people in general,\u201d Perry shared. \u201cOur options and our choices \u2013 we have so much choice we don\u2019t even know what to choose these days. I think you really have to separate yourself and that sometime you hit bells and whistles. Or maybe you\u2019re such an authentic person you can hear it in their voice. I don\u2019t want to hear people\u2019s voices. I want to feel people\u2019s voices.\u201d  The singer is advising those hoping to be the next American Idol, that choosing one of her songs is not going to win them any extra points.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be tough but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019d be the smartest thing to do unless you\u2019re reinventing it. Because typically I would be singing it the night before and I\u2019ve sang it ten thousand times,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut I want to hear it. But if you reinvent it then you re-inspire it for me so you give me that dopamine hit of \u2018oh yeah I feel that, I want to see what you do with something else.'\u201d  Perry admits hearing what some of the singers have gone through to get a chance to sing for her is a \u201cbeautiful hurt\u201d \u2013 but she is trying to keep her emotions at bay when it comes to being a judge.  \u201cYou really get invested in their stories obviously after you realize they have that kind of diamond in the rough,\u201d the \u201cSwish Swish\u201d singer said.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard when they\u2019re trying to sell the whole thing on the sob story it\u2019s like, everybody is going through something. Everybody comes from somewhere. I\u2019m not dismissing that and I don\u2019t want to take light of your situation but this is a business and we\u2019re here to find someone to elevate, to make an Idol.\u201d  American Idol premieres on ABC Sunday, March 11.",

        "doc_2_text": "Emma Stone didn\u2019t become one of America\u2019s most sought-after actresses overnight. She\u2019s worked her way up in Hollywood for years, and has the extensive resume to prove it.  These days, she\u2019s enjoying the fruits of her labor, and it\u2019s hard to imagine her as anything less than an A-lister. But it wasn\u2019t that long ago that she was just another actress trying to catch a big break.  And when she finally landed her first starring role, it was in a place many fans might not expect.  1. Stone first started acting when she was a child  Most of us don\u2019t think of Stone as a child actor. But she was \u2014 at least, in her hometown\u2019s community theater. Stone started acting when she was just 4 years old. And throughout her childhood, she was active in the Phoenix Valley Youth Theater program.  But when she was a teenager, she was ready for something more. And she knew how to get what she wanted.  Next: Stone used unconventional methods to convince her parents to let her be an actress.  2. She had a huge ambition  By the time she became a teenager, Stone had taken years of voice lessons and appeared in more than a dozen community productions. She knew she wanted to try her hand at acting professionally.  But she had to convince her parents to let her move from Scottsdale, Arizona to Los Angeles first. Stone created a PowerPoint presentation called \u201cProject Hollywood.\u201d The presentation was designed to show her parents, in detail, what pursuing her dreams would entail. And she proved that she knew how to achieve them.  Next: Stone\u2019s research paid off.  3. Stone got off to a shaky start in Hollywood  At 15 years old, Stone moved to Los Angeles to implement the plan. And she wasted no time in trying to find her big break.  But it took her some time to make any headway. \u201cI went up for every single show on the Disney Channel,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom. I ended up getting none.\u201d  Next: Stone\u2019s non-stop auditioning yielded surprising results.  4. She didn\u2019t let the rejection get her down  Stone\u2019s Hollywood project may not have gone to plan right away. But she didn\u2019t let the litany of no\u2019s deter her. Instead, she focused on her strengths \u2014 comedy and music \u2014 and kept auditioning. And within a few months, she found a path to fame, albeit through a slightly more unconventional route.  Before too long, she booked her television debut. She just had to jump through a few more hoops to get there.  Next: Emma Stone, reality star?  5. Stone\u2019s TV debut wasn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d expect for a future Oscar winner  In 2004, VH1 rebooted the classic \u201870s musical sitcom, The Partridge Family. And to drum up interest in the new series, they televised a reality competition to cast a new generation of actors in the iconic roles.  The up-and-coming actress \u2014 then going by her given name, Emily Stone \u2014 made the cut as one of the final contestants vying for the role of Laurie on In Search of The Partridge Family. Over the course of several episodes, she performed in acting and singing competitions designed to test her performance mettle.  She was a standout from the beginning, whether she was nailing her lines in Partridge Family-style skits or belting out \u201890s alt-rock classics like \u201cBitch.\u201d And in the end, she won the role.  But her apparent big break didn\u2019t last as long as she may have imagined.  Next: Stone\u2019s star was on the rise \u2013 but for how long?  6. Her \u201cCome On Get Happy\u201d days did not last long  The New Partridge Family wasn\u2019t a hit. In fact, it was barely a blip on the radar. Only one episode, the pilot, was produced. And it aired with little fanfare on VH1 in January 2005.  Stone has spoken about her time on the reality series on multiple occasions. She told Vogue that she went in just thinking of it as another gig. But after several weeks, she admits, she just \u201creally, really\u201d wanted to win.  If Stone was disappointed that the series didn\u2019t end up helping her in Hollywood, she didn\u2019t have to wait for long for another chance to breakthrough.  Next: The end of the new Partridge Family was for the best.  7. Stone\u2019s career took off not too long after  Sure, Stone didn\u2019t become a TV sensation. But the fact that The New Partridge Family was a flop probably ended up helping her career in the long run.  She began booking guest-starring roles on series like Medium and The Suite Life of Zach & Cody. And in 2007, she got another big break with a scene-stealing role in Superbad. For Stone, the rest is history. These days, she has serious Hollywood clout and a stellar career.  And she\u2019s even been able to put her singing talents to good use on more than one occasion since her Partridge Family days. Like, you know, when she won the Oscar for La La Land.  In other words, Project Hollywood was a success \u2014 even if she had to take a detour or two.  Follow Katherine Webb on Twitter @prufrox.  Check out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!",

If I want to have that true balance, I have to step into being Katheryn Hudson.\u201d  That back-to-basics mentality has helped the 33-year-old to value the relationships and people around her, like rumored boyfriend Orlando Bloom.  In April, the songstress and her actor boyfriend were able to meet the Pope as part of Unite to Cure conference in Vatican City. It was at the gathering that the pop star sung her praises about meditational therapy, which she claims \u201chelped a lot with my anxiety.\u201d  We are glad to hear Katy is back to feeling like the \u201cFirework\u201d she is.",

Savannah said that they were seated near each other in a restaurant, prompting Luke to look her up on Instagram and flatter her with compliments.  Savannah and Luke started dating not long after the restaurant encounter. Fast forward to now and it looks like Savannah and her basketball star boyfriend are getting pretty serious.

        "doc_1_text": "Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, \u201cIf you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.\u201d  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  \u201cJimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,\u201d Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. \u201cMike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.\u201d  Added Kimmel, \u201cHosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,\u201d De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. \u201cWe always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.\u201d  \u201cOur Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cJimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer\u2019s love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.\u201d  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, \u201cAfter just one year, we can\u2019t imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy\u2019s skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen \u2014 and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we\u2019re ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood\u2019s most prestigious award.\u201d  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show\u2019s producers and the producers then pick a host \u2014 a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy\u2019s board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year\u2019s show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who\u2019ve already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year\u2019s show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year\u2019s show, which doesn\u2019t take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn\u2019t given the hosting assignment until early December. \u201cI had to be at least eighth [choice],\u201d Kimmel joked to THR. \u201cIt took so long for them to ask.\u201d",

Now Mel C is reportedly refusing to go ahead with a second comeback tour, which will mark the band's 20th anniversary in 2016, without fifth member Victoria Beckham.  According to reports in The Sun, Mel, 41, formerly known as Sporty Spice, is arguing that Posh Spice needs to rejoin Emma Bunton, Mel B and Geri Horner for the tour to be a success.  Scroll down for video  Something's missing: Mel C (far right, here in December 2012) is reportedly refusing to go ahead with 2016's Spice Girls reunion with (from left) Mel B, Geri Horner (nee Halliwell) and Emma Bunton, in the absence of fifth member Victoria Beckham  A source told the newspaper: 'To fulfill this Mel believes the band has to be the original five-piece and Victoria needs to be involved.'  The Spice Girls originally agreed on an 'indefinite hiatus' in 1998 when Ginger Spice Geri decided to leave the group.  They put their differences aside in the next decade and reunited in their original formation with a tour called The Return Of The Spice Girls, which also included a performance at the London 2012 Olympics, and grossed over \u00a347M and produced \u00a371M in ticket sales and merchandising.  Say you'll be there? Sporty Spice (left) has doubts that the second comeback tour will be successful without Posh Spice (right)  Old friends: The pair laid claim to one of the strongest friendships in the group, while Mel B and Geri were reportedly always at loggerheads  This time around, Victoria - who lays claim to an international fashion empire under her own name - is said to have ducked out because she is 'too busy.'  A source told MailOnline in August: 'Victoria loved her time as a Spice Girl and wishes the girls nothing but success & happiness however she is now too busy running her brand and fulfilling the needs of her family.'  The remaining four-piece are also reportedly 'bickering' over management, agreeing that the spectacular will need 'good management, good tour promoters and good sponsorship' to work.  'The politics is making it hard,' added the source, confirming that the relationships between the women are still as tumultuous as they once were.

She said: '[Geri] left before but not publicly. I mean, I think a few of them had left, well, Melanie and Geri left a few times. I nearly got kicked out once as well, but that\u2019s another story.  'So yeah, I mean, it was difficult and you know, I think Geri would say these things herself. But you know she was having some personal issues and it\u2019s no secret that her and Melanie had a very fiery relationship in the past.'

        "doc_1_text": "Unless you've been living under a rock for the past week, you're likely to be aware of a certain girl band's reunion. I am of course referring to the mighty comeback of the Spice Girls, who recently announced their first tour in a decade of absence. However, one notable member is missing from the line up, so why is Victoria Beckham not doing the Spice Girls reunion tour?  Well as it stands, Beckham (Posh Spice) is yet to give an official statement regarding her exact reasoning for not taking part in the tour. Bustle has reached out for comment on the matter, and will update with any news when it becomes available. Despite not fully addressing her decision to not take part, Posh did leave a touching message of support for the rest of the girls upon the announcement of the 11 date tour. Speaking on Instagram, the former-band member said \"I won\u2019t be joining my girls on stage again but being in the Spice Girls was a hugely important part of my life and I wish them so much love and fun as they go back on tour next year. I know they will put on an amazing show and the fantastic fans past and present are going to have a wonderful time X vb #spicegirls.\"  Although speculation surrounding Beckham's no-show include rumours that the former Spice Girl is opting to focus on her own fashion brand, it appears the real reason Posh has decided against joining the UK tour could be much more simple. During a surprise appearance at the the People's Choice Awards 2018 in Los Angeles, Beckham took to the stage and scooped up the Fashion Icon Award. As reported by Cosmopolitan, Victoria apologised for relying on notecards throughout her acceptance speech, which left some wondering if Posh simply isn't comfortable performing onstage anymore. She said: \"I hung up my microphone some time ago and I get scared when I get up on stage and see a mic.\"  If this is indeed the case, that is a totally valid reason for not wanting to grace the stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. She also previously revealed that it was seeing Elton John perform back in 2008 that made her previously realise she didn't want to perform any longer. Speaking to Vogue Australia, the fashion designer revealed:  \u201cI was with Elton John this weekend and I told him. You\u2019re the reason why I stopped the Spice Girls. I went to see him in Vegas in doing The Red Piano, where David LaChapelle curated the most incredible show with him. And I remember sitting there very near to the front and looking at him singing those songs he\u2019d sung time after time, year after year, and his passion and his enjoyment was incredible, even after all that time.  And a few nights later, I was on stage at Madison Square Garden with the Spice Girls and I thought \u2018It\u2019s almost like a waste that I\u2019m given this opportunity. I appreciate the time I\u2019ve had with the girls, but I don\u2019t have what Elton can have after all these years. There was nothing there, other than that my kids were in the audience and I wanted them to see Mummy doing the Spice Girls.\"  She went on to add how challenging the industry could sometimes be. \"I had a lunch with the Spice Girls a few months ago to see how everybody was, things spiralled out of control, and I had my lawyer trying to beat down stories that were completely ludicrous,\" she explained. \"It was a reminder of how awful that was.\"  Even without the inclusion of Posh Spice \u2014 who will of course be missed \u2014 this tour is set to be something special. Last week, Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice), Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), and Melanie Brown (Scary Spice) announced their much-hyped tour on social media in a news broadcast parody. In the video, Geri jokes \"We\u2019re going on tour. People need to see it to believe it\", before Mel C adds \"We can\u2019t be falling out now if we\u2019re going on tour.\"  If demand for tickets following the special announcement is anything to go by, it seems that there is a strong appetite for all things Spice. As reported by the Express, Andrew Parson, the managing director at Ticketmaster, said \"Demand for Spice Girls was off the chart. They have smashed through Ticketmaster UK\u2019s records becoming the busiest ever sale\", and continued \"There were millions of people on our site searching for tickets, with a queue at one point of well over 700,000. Hundreds of thousands of tickets were sold to happy fans across the country within minutes. Congratulations to the girls.\"  So if you'd like to experience this once in a lifetime UK stadium tour, you'd better act quickly because tickets are selling like hot cakes. The Spice Girls tour kicks off on Wednesday 29 May at the Manchester Etihad Stadium, and concludes with a three night stint at the Wembley Stadium in London. See you there.",

However it seems the Spice Girls may have dashed the fans hopes of a reunion yet again due to claims that Victoria Beckham has allegedly refused to tour.  The iconic pop band's reunion tour is believed to have been called off following rifts between Posh and Melanie C, Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton, reports the Sun.  It's all off! The Spice Girls may have dashed the fans hopes of a reunion yet again due to claims that Victoria Beckham has allegedly refused to tour  While Victoria has always insisted that she would never tour with the band again, the girls thought their original manager Simon Fuller would convince her, an insider told the website.  The women were set to make \u00a330million each following the tour which was due to begin in late September after manager Simon masterminded the comeback.  MailOnline has contacted a representative for Victoria for comment.  The insider claimed that the band was in 'disarray' following 'heated debates between the girls and Victoria'.  Refusal: While Victoria has always insisted that she would never tour with the band again, the girls thought their original manager Simon Fuller would convince her, an insider told the website  The source said: 'Simon was brought in to convince her to take the offer but now he's failed they feel he's used them to put his name back on the map.'  It is claimed that the other girls approached Victoria last week and gave her an ultimatum between them and Simon.  However it is believed that she chose their manager, who managed to turn her brand into an empire.  Back in the day: The iconic pop band's reunion tour is believed to have been called off following rifts between Posh and Melanie C, Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton, reports the Sun  The cause of this latest chapter in the reunion saga is apparently to do with money, with a source stating that Mel B and Mel C are wanting to 'cash in'.  Despite her solo success Mel B's recent account history shows that her company Red Girl Records is \u00a3808,568 in debt with her Red Girl Touring Ltd suffering losses of \u00a377,956 last year.  Her financial situation was laid bare in the courts last year as it was revealed her multi-million fortune had been wiped out due to her 'extravagant' lifestyle.  And in another shocking twist to the Mel B and Stephen Belafonte divorce battle, it was claimed the Spice Girls star has just \u00a3961 left in one of her company accounts.  Lucrative: The women were set to make \u00a330million each following the tour which was due to begin in late September after manager Simon masterminded the comeback  Accounts filed for Victoria's luxury label, which sells high-end dresses and accessories, saw losses almost double to \u00a38.5 million last year - up from \u00a34.3million in 2015.  Meanwhile husband David's company DB Ventures, which handles the former footballer's endorsement deals, reported a profit of \u00a324.9million after tax in 2016. This is the equivalent to roughly \u00a32million a month.  Sales at VBL remained stable over the year however losses grew on the back of increased investment in the fashion brand's design, marketing and sales.  Earlier this year the former pop star's fashion business was valued at \u00a3100million following a major cash injection from former Goldman Sachs banker David Belhassen, the man behind French-inspired bakery chain Paul.  Decision time! It is claimed that the other girls approached Victoria last week and gave her an ultimatum between them and Simon  The Beckham's have recently been forced to shoot down rumours of an impending divorce.  After rumors of an impending split began racing around social media on Friday, Jo Milloy, a spokesman for Spice Girl-turned-designer Victoria, told the Daily Mail that the gossip was \u2018absolute nonsense\u2019.  Meanwhile former England football captain\u2019s spokesman, Simon Oliveira, likewise dubbed the claims \u2018embarrassing and laughable\u2019.  Elsewhere, a spokesman for the couple was quoted as saying: \u2018There is no statement due, no divorce, and a lot of Chinese whispers and fake social media news. This is all very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time.\u2019 The rumours were \u2018a crock of s***\u2019, he said.",

The six-year-old daughter of Victoria and David Beckham played with her mum\u2019s old Spice Girls dolls, with Victoria taking to her Instagram stories to share the fun with her followers. Victoria is known for her part as Posh Spice in the nineties pop group, and it looks like little Harper enjoyed playing with the mini version of her mum.  \u00a9 Photo: Instagram  Victoria posted three pictures of Harper\u2019s playtime for fans to see. In one photo, Harper can be seen looking at the five dolls of Posh Spice, Sporty Spice (Mel C), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) and Scary Spice (Mel B).

The fashion designer was in the world-famous group from 1994, with their debut single Wannabe in 1996. The Spice Girls sold a staggering 85million records worldwide. Geri announced her decision to leave in 1998 and two years later the band went on hiatus. Geri went on to launch a solo career, achieving four number one singles. Since then, the Spice Girls have gone on to reunite for a 2007 concert tour, and also performed together at the 2012 London Olympics.  \u00a9 Photo: Instagram  Last August, Victoria\u2019s husband David told Emma Bunton that he had been encouraging his wife to join them on an anniversary tour. \"For a long time she has wished us the best,\" Emma confessed during an appearance on This Morning. \"I was talking to her at David's birthday party and he said, 'You've got to do something.' Maybe she will change her mind, she does that, who knows.\"",

This comes after the One Direction singer said that everyone is a little bit gay at his concert in New York, months after fans hailed his new song Medicine as an anthem for bisexual people.  In addition to the tour promoting the theme of inclusiveness and treating people with kindness, Variety reported Harry Styles had raised money for 62 charities around the world.  Harry Styles has managed to raise over $1.2 million for charity during his debut solo world tour  After releasing his first solo debut album that many have considered to be unconventional and moving in a very different direction to his previous music, Harry won over critics with the release of his glam-rock inspired LP.  As reported in Forbes, his self-titled album, that reached the top of the Billboard 200, included his hit single Sign of the Times, which reached no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Variety revealed that one million tickets were sold for his 90-show tour and saw the former Directioner perform in intimate venues as well as arenas, with support from the likes of Leon Bridges, Muna, Warpaint and Kacey Musgraves.  89 of his shows were sold out and it was the first arena tour to sell out through Ticketmaster\u2019s new Verified Fan program with the first leg selling out in 29 seconds.  Harry\u2019s final show at the Forum in Inglewood, California tallied over 17,000 paid tickets and beat the record for the most paid tickets for a single show since the venue opened for the second time back in 2014.  The world tour also had a charitable impact and raised $1.2 million from ticket contributions, Live Nation contributions and matching payments, as well as encouraging hundreds of new voters to register via Headcount.  Harry also made an effort to promote water conservation by saving the equivalent of 10,000 single-use water bottles by fans and 3,200 by the band and crew.  He also partnered with the GLSEN campaign, which works to create a safe and inclusive environment in schools for LGBTQ youth. On his final stop, Harry also paused to comment on a fan\u2019s sign before performing What Makes You Beautiful.  Billboard reported that after reading the sign, he said \u2018Can I read this? It says, \u201cI\u2019m gay and I love you.\u201d\u2019 After thanking the fan, Harry said: \u2018I mean, we\u2019re all a little bit gay, aren\u2019t we?",

Currently in its 18th week of release, it's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies.  All of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies.  However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined.  2014's 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012's Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010's Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008's Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales.  Swift\u2019s 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May. She recently released the video for her new single \"Delicate\", which imagined the musician gaining the power of invisibility, allowing her a brief sojourn away from her much-tormenting \"reputation\".

With new music, appearances and more, Harry was everywhere. Here\u2019s why we picked him!  Harry Styles, 23, is having what\u2019s sure to be one of the best weeks of his life\u2026and HollywoodLife.com is naming him our Star of the Week because of it. The first reason, of course, is because of the release of his very first solo album, Harry Styles. Just a month and a half after he announced he\u2019d be putting out solo music, Harry dropped his debut record, and it immediately soared to the top of the charts. Fans are going completely crazy over the album\u2019s ten songs, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of the 23-year-old!  Aside from putting out a record, Harry also started doing solo public appearances to promote the music. Fans started lining up for his Today Show concert almost TWO full days in advance, and the crowd went on for SIX New York City blocks when he took the stage on May 9. Harry looked hotter than ever while performing \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d \u201cCarolina\u201d and \u201cEver Since New York\u201d for the crowd, and he totally proved he can own that stage, even without his One Direction band mates.  Obviously, it\u2019s been a totally hectic few days for Harry \u2014 he was in New York for the first half of the week, then jetted back to London for the album release. Still, he\u2019s made sure to stop and spend time with his fans, posing for selfies and chatting with his loyal supporters. He even sweetly sent pizza out to those waiting in the Today show line all night long. How cute is that?!  Things aren\u2019t slowing down for Harry any time soon, either. He\u2019ll be promoting his music for the next few weeks, and then his first movie, Dunkirk, is set to hit theaters on July 21. After the press run for that is over, he\u2019ll have to start prepping for his tour in the fall. That tour, by the way, sold out in SECONDS when the tickets went on sale last week. GO HARRY GO!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Harry is a good pick for Star of the Week?! What\u2019s your fave thing he did this week?",

Kiyoko, 27, said in a quote on social media Friday that the new song - which features Cardi B, Charli XCX and Bebe Rexha - is 'just downright tone-deaf' and 'does more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community.'  The Curious artist said that after listening to the track, she was 'overwhelmed with thoughts,' saying she felt 'a song like this just fuels the male gaze while marginalizing the idea of women loving women.  Scroll down for video  Superstar: Rita Ora, 27, took to the stage at the O2 Academy in Glasgow, Scotland for a show on Friday, after her fellow singer Hayley Kiyoko said she's not a fan of Ora's latest single, titled Girls  She added: 'It\u2019s important for us artists to use our platforms to move the cultural needle forward, not backwards.'  The Los Angeles native said that she understood 'the artists on the song' did not intend it to be interpreted in such a way, but feels that the song's lyrics reflect a 'lack of consideration' toward the dynamics of sexual identity.  Kiyoko, whose full name is Hayley Kiyoko Alcroft, seemed to take exception toward the chorus of the track: 'Sometimes, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls/ Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls.'  Speaking out: Hayley Kiyoko, 27, said she thinks the latest single from Rita Ora, titled Girls, is 'just downright tone-deaf' and 'does more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community'  Charismatic: Ora smiled as she played to her fans amid a colorful backdrop on the stage  Fashionista: The performer wore a garment that had multiple shades of plaid  Creative: Ora said she was inspired by I Kissed a Girl by Katy Perry in coming up with the single  The Sleepover performer said, 'I don\u2019t need to drink wine to kiss girls; I\u2019ve loved women my entire life,' adding that 'this type of message is dangerous because it completely belittles and invalidates the very pure feelings of an entire community.  'I feel I have a responsibility to protect that whenever possible. We can and should do better.'  Kiyoko, who has been nicknamed 'Lesbian Jesus' for her advocacy and art, noted that 'artists who freely express themselves' and 'male and female artists who are opening up more and more about their sexual identities' have her full support.  Exuberant: Rita looked to be in a great mood as she entertained the crowd  Making a statement: Ora described her new song as 'a real gender-fluid freedom record'  Center-of-attention: The enigmatic artist delved into the crowd of her fans  Ora told People on Friday that she feels 'the song is very impactful in its own way,' and 'definitely has a point' to make on a social plane.  'For me, I always looked at this song as a real gender-fluid freedom record. I never looked at it as, \u201cOnly females can listen to it\u201d or \u201cOnly males can listen to it\u201d: It\u2019s for everybody,' said the London native, noting she was inspired by I Kissed a Girl by Katy Perry in coming up with the upbeat single.  'It really represents freedom and the chance to be what you want to be - and there being no judgment and just living your life as you want to live it. That\u2019s what this song represents to me every time I hear it.'  Ready to rock: Meanwhile, Rita pulled out all the stops while performing at the O2 Academy in Glasgow on the first night of her tour on Friday night  Crowd pleaser: The Anywhere hitmaker dressed to appeal to her Scottish crowd, donning an all tartan ensemble of yellow and navy mini skirt and matching crop top, showing off her lithe limbs  Beauty: She kept her makeup simple, wearing mascara to make her brown eyes pop and adding a quirky gem to her temple  Golden girl: The 27-year-old songstress styled her blonde tresses in ringlets and wore a pair of golden spectacles on her nose  Dazzling: The songstress looked incredible as she performed for the crowd in Scotland  Daring: Rita wore a quirky tartan ensemble for her Scottish fans at the O2 Academy  Meanwhile, Rita pulled out all the stops while performing at the O2 Academy in Glasgow on the first night of her tour on Friday night.

The songstress styled her blonde tresses in ringlets and wore a pair of golden spectacles on her nose.  She kept her makeup simple, wearing mascara to make her brown eyes pop and adding a quirky gem to her temple.

Driven by an expertly cryptic promotional campaign, the first single from Swift's forthcoming album Reputation set first-day records on YouTube and Spotify and drew the biggest weekly streaming and sales numbers for a single yet this year, according to Billboard.  Now, \"Look\" is the new No. 1 song in the country. It broke Adele's record (of 61.6 million plays) for most-streamed debut week by a female artist, with 84.4 million U.S. streams. And, in what must be a bitter disappointment for Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, Swift displaced \"Despacito\" atop the Hot 100, where it has sat for four months. If \"Despacito\" had lasted one more week at No. 1, it would have set an all-time record for most weeks at the top of the chart.  Swift is the first woman to top the Hot 100 chart this year.  As mentioned, \"Look\" also set records the first day it was released, breaking Spotify's high-water mark for first-day streams \u2014 set by her friend Ed Sheeran earlier this year \u2014 with 10,129,087 plays in a single day. It was also the most streams generated by any song in one day since Spotify launched.  On video sites, \"Look\" also broke first-day numbers, drawing in 43.2 million plays on YouTube its first day of release, unseating PSY's 2013 single \"Gentleman.\" Over on Vevo, the song also broke first-day views with more than 30 million.  Meanwhile, Swift released another new song this past Sunday \u2014 the more generally focused but equally self-examining and faux-lectro-luxe \"... Ready For It?\" \u2014 but all anyone seems to care about is \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" That new single drew 3.74 million plays on Spotify in the two days since its release over the long weekend \u2014 numbers that would be impressive for anyone, if that anyone hadn't done what \"Look\" just did.",

Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her \u201clongtime\u201d tour promoter told Billboard, \u201cBy the time all the tickets are sold next week, I\u2019ll be celebrating Taylor\u2019s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.\u201d But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post\u2019s headline, \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,\u201d is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  Advertisement  The company\u2019s \u201cVerified Fan\u201d program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents\u2019 credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could \u201cimprove [their] position in line to purchase tickets.\u201d And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  Advertisement  \u201cI paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201cNow for the same seats I have to pay about $500.\u201d  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry\u2019s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.",

Apparently, only Victoria Beckham (who attended William and Kate's wedding in 2011), Geri Halliwell and Emma Bunton are on the guest list, a source told the celeb news site.    That means only Posh Spice, Ginger Spice and Baby Spice will be present, while Sporty Spice (Mel C) and Scary Spice (Mel B) are MIA. To put salt in our wounds, the insider added that Spice Girls \"were never going to perform\" at the wedding in the first place. This news follows previous reports that the whole girl gang had received invites for the May 19 nuptials.  And now, Mel C has spoken out about being left off of the guest list. Appearing on Australian radio program Fitzy & Wippa this week (via Daily Mail), Mel C announced, \"I should clear up the invitation part of it\u2014we were never invited!\" Basically, Mel B's previous claims that the group would be performing at the wedding appear to have been untrue.  Mel C reiterated that, \"No. We were never invited, we were never asked to perform... and I was a little bit annoyed, actually!\" She also revealed that, having seen Prince Charles at an event recently, she was tempted to say something about the snub. She told the hosts, \"He's a lovely, lovely man. But I felt like going 'Oy! Where's my invite?'\"  TMZ also reported earlier this week that \"there are no current plans to have the group perform at any point in the festivities.\" Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Kensington Palace had reportedly not asked the iconic girl group to take the stage for their big day.  Sources told the TMZ that Spice Girls \"haven't rehearsed anything for the wedding,\" further shutting down speculation for a performance. So although the epic quintet are officially reuniting, it looks like the royal wedding isn't included in their list of new projects.  Speculation over Spice Girls' possible royal wedding cameo began in February, after Mel B's vague answers about the ceremony left fans to believe she and the rest of the band would be present at the event.  Ellie Goulding performed at Prince William and Kate Middleton's reception in 2011; which pop star will take the stage for Harry and Meghan's ceremony?",

And Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night.  The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida.  Baggy dress: Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night  The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset.  The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do.  The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels.  Stepping out: The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida  Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish.  The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance.  The artist explained on Thursday why she was staying silent, telling people that they should listen to her upcoming album if they want to discover things she'd rather rap about than talk about, during an interview on Apple Music out Thursday.  Striking: The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset  Blonde ambition: The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do  Sharp: Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish  Sole survivor: The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels  Keeping mum: The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance  Hot right now: She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release  Speaking to Ebro Darden, the starlet said: 'I feel like people just got to tune in a little bit on my album and they will know a little bit more because I can't address all the rumors and everything.  'I have been so open to people about myself. People cannot expect me to be open about everything. Certain things to me, it has to be private. You cannot invade my privacy,' said B ahead of her Friday album release.  Cardi - who became engaged to Offset in October last year - blasted the idea that she should be open like an 'animal in the zoo', and hinted that people would only know if she was pregnant 'if it [the baby] arrives'.  Speaking during an interview for Beats 1 Radio, Cardi said: 'I'm not a damn animal at the zoo that you just could see everything, no. People will just find out more. If it arrives, if it don't arrive, then you gonna know what the f**k is going on.'  At the beginning of December, 2017, Cardi B said that she and Offset plan to spend $1 million on their wedding.  Loved up: One member Offset is also engaged to rapper Cardi B who happens to be the hottest up-and-comer in hip-hop, as the couple are pictured together in February  'We're going to spend over a million,' she told BBC Radio One\u2019s Charlie Sloth.  The pregnancy rumors come after Offset's iCloud was hacked and photos and footage was leaked of him with another girl.  Cardi forgave her beau for the gaffe, and said she doesn't owe an explanation to those who wonder why she didn't leave the star.  She said: 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck like, \"Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem.\"  'I don't have low self-esteem ... I know I look good. I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented. I know I could get any man I want - any basketball player, football player.  'But I want to work out my s**t with my man, and I don't got to explain why. I'm not your property. This is my life... I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision...  'It's not right, what he f***ing did, but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.'  While Cardi was willing to forgive the Motorsport rapper (seen in her Bartier Crdi video above) for his indiscretion, she was less understanding about people's unsolicited advice, saying 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck'  Last year, she signed a record deal with Atlantic Records, whose other artists include Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran.  Cardi B\u2019s \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019 topped Billboard 100 for three consecutive weeks and her boyfriend, Migos\u2019 Offset, became her fianc\u00e9 when he proposed to her in October.  Her first music appearance was in November 2015, on Shaggy\u2019s \u2018Boom Boom\u2019 remix single.  Following two mixtapes, Gangsta B*tch Music, Vol. 1 and Gangsta B*tch, Vol. 2, the rapper signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in February, 2017.  In May of the same year, Cardi B was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the 2017 BET Awards.  In January 2018, Cardi B surpassed Beyonce as the first female artist to have five Top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in the same week.

Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan\u2019s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s not my sort of music. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d listen to,\u201d he said. But he did have a quick save: \u201cI think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That\u2019s the way I\u2019d put it best, I think.\u201d Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn\u2019t listen to hip-hop. \u201cMy song\u2019s more \u2018Rack City\u2019 and his song is more of a different era to something I\u2019d listen to, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cStrip That Down\u201d does feature a rapper, Migos\u2019s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.

The singer has been juggling, performing hilarious skits about singing, and even taking over the opening monologue (complete with some rather epic dad jokes).  What\u2019s more, Harold has performed a few of the tracks from his debut solo album, which was released last week, including \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d \u201cCarolina,\u201d \u201cKiwi,\u201d and \u201cTwo Ghosts.\u201d  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLGsNnt3r9E  To close off his residency, Harry Styles joined James Corden on his journey into work for one EPIC Carpool Karaoke.  Of course, this isn\u2019t Harry\u2019s first time helping James with his commute. The British singer has previously appeared on Carpool Karaoke with One Direction. But as we\u2019ve come to expect, Harry and James make their way through some musical hits, including Harry\u2019s songs \u201cSign of the Times\u201d and \u201cSweet Creature,\u201d as well as OutKast\u2019s \u201cHey Ya\u201d and Diana Ross and Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cEndless Love.\u201d  After completing \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d Harry revealed that the track actually makes him a bit emotional, and that he\u2019s cried \u201cin a cool way\u201d after performing the song live.  James also compliments the singer on his effortless style, with the pair switching outfits (Harry even ends up wearing a skintight, gold lam\u00e9 shirt and string vest!).  Things really heat up, however, when Harry Styles and James Corden decide to recreate some famous scenes from romantic movies.  As we know, Harry is a HUGE fan of rom-coms, but we didn\u2019t expect him to be *this* good at it. He expertly does Julia Roberts\u2019s role in Notting Hill, and the pair even do Kate Winslet\u2019s \u201cdraw me like one of your French girls\u201d scene from Titanic.  Watch Harry Styles and James Corden\u2019s incredible and hilarious Carpool Karaoke below.  Omg! After watching this, we\u2019re convinced that Harry needs to do a romantic comedy (hey, he is an actor now). We can picture it already. He could even provide the soundtrack.  Someone make this happen!  Meanwhile, Harry Styles\u2019 self-titled debut album is out now.",

The two sang a variety of musical hits, including Harry's songs \"Sign of the Times\" and \"Sweet Creature,\" as well as OutKast's \"Hey Ya\" and Diana Ross and Lionel Richie's \"Endless Love.\" After completing \"Sign of the Times,\" Harry revealed that the song makes him a bit emotional and that he has cried \"in a cool way\" after performing the song live.\n\nAs they continued their journey, Harry and James decided to recreate some famous scenes from romantic movies. Harry expertly did Julia Roberts's role in Notting Hill and even did Kate Winslet's \"draw me like one of your French girls\" scene from Titanic. After watching this, some fans are convinced that Harry needs to do a romantic comedy (he is now an actor).\n\nHarry Styles' self-titled debut album is out now.",

Following her appearance at the event, held in New York City's Madison Square Gardens, the search term \"Lady Gaga face lift\" started trending on Google.  Taking to Twitter, viewers accused Gaga \u2014 real name Stefani Germanotta \u2014 of having had appearance-altering procedures.  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  One fan said of the 31-year-old: \"Oh no. She's started the plastic surgery crisis phase.\"  Another wrote: \"Why did she get plastic surgery herself? Her face at the Grammys looks nothing like her face in 2009.\"  In agreement, a viewer remarked: \"That doesn't even look like Gaga. What has she done to her face?\"  Taking things a step further, one Twitter user made reference to the singer's empowering 2011 song which encouraged people to be comfortable in their own skin.  They wrote: \"Gaga? What happened to 'You were Born this Way'? Love your face as normal.  (Image: Getty) (Image: Getty)  \"Stop lift [sic] and Botox your face. You're very pretty without this bulls***.\"  In search of an expert opinion, Daily Star Online contacted plastic surgeon Dr Maurino Joffily of Harley Street, London.  After studying pictures of Gaga \u2014 dating from 2007 to the present day \u2014 the medical practitioner revealed what appearance-altering procedures he believes the singer has had done.  Talking exclusively to us, Dr Joffily revealed he spotted indications the award-winning performer has had a nose job.  He said: \"The nose looks straighter and narrower, and the tip more defined.\"  (Image: Getty) (Image: Getty)  However, the London-based surgeon also suggested another explanation for the change in appearance of Gaga's nose.  The medical professional explained: \"Even though her nose looks different, it might be a result of some fillers and Botox combined.\"  Commenting on the starlet's face, he added: \"I suspect [use of] Botox as in many pictures her brows look higher.  \"She might also have had fillers in her chin and cheeks.\"  In a 2013 interview with Sirius XM radio host Howard Stern, 64, Gaga denied having had any work done, but admitted to using facial injections.  (Image: Getty)  Getting candid on the New York-based show, she said: \"I've never had any 'work work' done, but I went through a phase when I was smoking pot when I was really obsessed with getting facial injections...  \"Before I shot the Applause video, [a photographer friend] was like, 'Gaga, I love you but if you don't stop injecting s*** in your face, I'm going to just kill you.'\"  After studying recent pictures of the US musician, Dr Joffily noted further signs of appearance-altering procedures.  He told us: \"Her lips are more prominent and fuller, indicating some fillers there as well.\"  Daily Star Online has contacted Lady Gaga's representative for comment.",

        "doc_1_text": "It's not the first story to start with a wedding and end with a funeral, but Cardi B dropped her \"Be Careful\" music video on Monday, and it shows the rapper as both a bride and widow. The video opens with the rapper walking ominously through the desert, a white cross in hand. Then, it cuts to a wedding in a small chapel, with Cardi in a big white dress. Of course, it doesn't seem that this holy union ended well, as soon she's leaning over her lover's coffin at his funeral. In the final scene, she drives into the wilderness to rest the wooden cross on the grave. The video concept goes well with the song, which is a warning to an unfaithful lover. \"The only man, baby, I adore, I gave you everything, what's mine is yours,\" Cardi B raps. \"I want you to live your life of course, but I hope you get what you dyin' for.\"  According to Spin, Jora Frantzis, a photographer and director, brought the themes from the song into the music video. Frantzis has collaborated with Cardi B in the past, and is also behind the album art for her debut, Invasion of Privacy. As Spin notes, for this song, Frantzis seems to have taken a page from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, which also features a similar wedding scene. The film is all about revenge, so it's a fitting reference for a song and video about a wronged lover. It borrows the desert church location, but the design of the music video is distinct to Cardi B's style and aesthetic.  In April, Cardi B performed \"Be Careful\" on Saturday Night Live and revealed during the performance that she was expecting her first child with fianc\u00e9 Offset. In the past, fans have speculated that the song is about her current partner. Cardi has since dispelled these rumors in interviews, arguing the track is about past relationships, meant to tell of a universal experience, and recorded long before getting engaged.  In an interview with Ebro Darden for Beats 1, she addressed the Offset rumors head on. \"No, I wasn't talkin' about Offset, I just was talkin' about things that I relate to and that have happened to me. You just think about different types of things that you went with different type of men,\" she told the host. \"First of all, I heard the record before I even like was in love with Offset. Our relationship is like, at first we liked each other, but it was very protective of each other because people would put things in your ears and it's like I gotta protect my heart.\"  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  This doesn't mean the musical couple's relationship has been without controversy. In February, rumors that the Migos rapper was cheating on Cardi B spread online. Once again, she shut down the critics in an interview with Cosmopolitan. \u201cIt\u2019s like everybody is coming down my neck, like, \u2018Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem.\u2019 I don\u2019t have low self-esteem,\u201d Cardi said in the interview. \u201cI know I look good, I know I\u2019m rich, I know I\u2019m talented. I know I could get any man I want \u2014 any basketball player, football player. But I want to work out my sh*t with my man, and I don\u2019t got to explain why.\" She continued, \"I\u2019m going to take my time, and I\u2019m going to decide on my decision \u2026 It\u2019s not right, what he f*cking did \u2014 but people don\u2019t know what I did, \u2019cause I ain\u2019t no angel.\u201d  In light of her recent success, the rapper has every reason to clap back at critics. According to Forbes, her first album, Invasion of Privacy, is certified gold by the RIAA and it debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts. \"Be Careful\" is just one of the album's hit singles to debut in the Billboard Hot 100, including \"Bodak Yellow\", \"Bartier Cadi\", and \"Drip\". She's also featured on Bruno Mars chart-topping son, \"Finesse\", which she performed at the 60th Grammy Awards.  It doesn't seem like Cardi B's reign over the music industry will end anytime soon, and the video for \"Be Careful\" is just the latest way her star power continues to flourish.",

        "doc_2_text": "The past couple months have been devastating for anyone who follows the love lives of the Hollywood elite. Iconic couples \u2014 from Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan to John Cena and Nikki Bella \u2014 have been calling it quits left and right. And this morning, Twitter was on fire with speculation that another famous couple was on the way to Splitsville \u2014 Victoria and David Beckham! *GASP* What? Noooooo. So, are David and Victoria Beckham divorcing? The answer is no, according to a statement David's rep gave to Mirror Online.  \"There is no statement due or divorce,\" the rep said, slamming the rumors with one sentence. \"This is just fake social media news. This is all very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time.\" Elite Daily reached out to David's team for comment on the report, but did not hear back by the time of publication.  How did these rumors start? Well, does it really matter? It seems like rumors that David and Victoria are divorcing pop up every other year. So it seems we're right on schedule.  But, just for your information, it seems the spark that lit the fire under this round of speculation came when whispers that David was cheating on Victoria with their daughter, Harper's, teacher (and that she's supposedly now pregnant with his child) hit Twitter. Elite Daily reached out to David and Victoria's teams for comment on the cheating rumors, but did not hear back by the time of publication.  According to Mirror Online, \"bookies suspended betting on news of them splitting following thousands of tweets claiming the couple would be putting out a statement.\" Which, is, like, the saddest sentence I've ever read. Who bets on the downfall of someone's marriage?! Come on now. Be better.  Twitter is currently freaking out.  But the denial from David's rep is pretty strong. And if you've been keeping an eye on the Beckham's social media pages, Victoria made things pretty clear in the early hours of June 8 when speculation was running rampant on Twitter, that she and David are totally and utterly fine. She shared a photo cuddling with Harper and captioned it, \"Morning cuddles x So much love \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb We love and miss u @davidbeckham \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95.\"  Can we crown Victoria the queen of sub-Instagramming right here and now? I mean, there's so much going on in this Instagram. Like, first of all, she's cuddling with Harper, her daughter whose teacher is being wrapped up in all this drama. And then, she tagged her hubby and said she misses him hardcore, which, I assume, she wouldn't have said he was a lowdown, good-for-nothing cheater.  Anyway, like I said, this couple is no stranger to divorce rumors. Back in February 2017, when they were dealing with rumors that they were only together because of their bazillion-dollar brand (see a pattern here?), David shut them down hard.  In February, David told BBC Radio listeners,  Of course, you make mistakes over the years, and we all know marriage is difficult at times. It's about working through it. We know each other better than anybody. People have talked about, 'Do we stay together because it's a brand?' Of course not. We stay together because we love each other, because we have four amazing children.  At the end of the day, David and Victoria have been happily married for 19 years and have four amazing children together: Brooklyn (19), Romeo (15), Cruz (13), and Harper (6).  And, for the record, Victoria never runs out of beautiful things to say about her soccer-star husband, either.  Back in 2017, the former Spice Girl told Today host Savannah Guthrie,  I'm lucky that David is the most fantastic father and husband, and he's great. We're very equal at home, and we're a really, really good team\u2026 He's the most incredible husband, fantastic father. He inspires me every day. Not just seeing him with the children and how he treats me. It just works. We're lucky to have each other.  Watch her gushing about David below:  Now, can y'all just let these perfect angels be happy?",

The second season of Big Little Lies was confirmed by HBO at the end of 2017, and after series one triumphed at the Golden Globes (winning Best Television Limited Series, plus individual awards for Nicole Kidman, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Laura Dern), expectations are high.  Shailene Woodley took to Instagram to share the first official promo picture from the second series, which shows the five leading characters taking part in an identity parade - still wearing the same Audrey Hepburn costumes from that fateful night in the finale of the first season.  The other cast members have also been taking to Instagram to share teasers, including Nicole Kidman:  Here's everything we know about season two so far...  The release date  The second series will land on 9 June 2019 on HBO with Sky Atlantic sure to follow suit.  HBO  Filming started in March 2018 - confirmed by Witherspoon during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers - and shortly afterwards the lead stars started sharing behind-the-scenes images on social media.      This was closely followed by a snap of Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern on set.  The plot  The first series of Big little Liars was based on the book of the same name by Liane Moriarty, focusing on Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), Celeste (Nicole Kidman) and Jane (Shailene Woodley), and how their seemingly perfect lives unravelled to the point of murder.  Big Little Lies cast in season 2 HBO  But what can we expect from the second instalment? More stories exploring friendship, marriage and parenting it seems, plus - of course - \"the malignancy of lies\".  Related Story Nicole pays tribute to Reese in Globes speech  \"[Moriarty] came up with a novella, which was key. David took it and thought, 'Is there something I can do with it?'\" Bloys told Vulture. \"Reese and Nicole were involved, and they felt that there was more life in the characters. Everybody approached it from a place of love and care [for] these characters and this property, and again, with a little dose of skepticism along the way.\"  HBO  Witherspoon said in a statement that season 2 provides \"the opportunity to delve deeper into the lives of these intriguing and intricate Monterey families and bring more of their stories back to the audience who embraced and championed them.\"  \u201cThis is inspired by the overwhelming response from audiences around the world,\" added Kidman. \"What a journey this has been. I\u2019m so grateful to have this opportunity to keep exploring these female characters and make this series with my friends.\u201d    Reese Witherspoon and Zoe Kravitz look intense in season 2 HBO  HBO describes the second series like so: \"The subversive, darkly comedic drama Big Little Lies will explore the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting. Relationships will fray, loyalties will erode\u2026 the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom.\"  The director  While the first season was helmed by Canadian director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (known for his work on Dallas Buyers Club and alongside Witherspoon in Wild), the second series will be directed by English filmmaker Andrea Arnold. Her work has won several accolades at the Cannes Film Festival, and she recently directed three episodes of the Emmy-winning series Transparent.  \"I\u2019m beyond excited to be working with talented and acclaimed director Andrea Arnold who will be at the helm,\" said Witherspoon. \"Andrea\u2019s unique storytelling style will be a welcome addition to the filmmaking team.\u201d  Witherspoon paid tribute to Vall\u00e9e backstage at the 2018 Golden Globes following Big Little Lies' award win for Best Television Limited Series.  The \u2019Big Little Lies\u2019 cast at the 2018 Golden Globes Getty Images  \u201cWe are so deeply grateful to Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e,\u201d she said. \u201cHis vision for these characters \u2014 he put his artistry and his heart and soul into it. His musical taste is all over this miniseries. Unfortunately, he was busy.  \u201cWe did try and accommodate, but we wanted to get the second season going soon. We were lucky to have Andrea Arnold sign on to the family. Jean-Marc has welcomed her to the family and we\u2019re thrilled to have her on board.\u201d  The cast  The entire main first-season cast has been confirmed to return. When HBO announced the new series, it noted that Witherspoon, Kidman and Woodley would all be starring. It was later confirmed that Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern would all also be reappearing - as will Kathryn Newton, who plays Madeleine (Witherspoon)'s daughter Abigail. Adam Scott will also be reprising his role as Ed Mackenzie.  According to reports, Witherspoon and Kidman have negotiated a pretty substantial pay rise for the second series and will each be taking home $1 million per episode. According to The Hollywood Reporter they both earned around $250,000 per episode for season one. It's believed that Woodley, Dern and Kravitz will also be getting a sizeable bump in pay.  The big news, of course, centres around a new addition to the cast; Meryl Streep is moving to Monterey. The Oscar-winning actress, who invited herself to join the cast without even having seen the script, is set to shake things up as Celeste's mother-in-law, Mary Louise Wright. Witherspoon confirmed the casting via Instagram.  Mary Louise's son, Perry, who was played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, met his demise at the end of season one and it seems as though his mother has come to town to ask questions. According to on-set pictures which were captured during filming, Mary Louise finds herself on the wrong side of Madeleine, who was seen throwing an ice cream at her.    It was later reported that Streep went to great lengths in order to play a realistic mother to Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, wearing prosthetic teeth throughout filming in order to replicate a similar smile to the Swedish actor.  The rumours were confirmed by her hair and make-up artist, J. Roy Helland, who told Refinery29: \u201cShe needed to be believable as Perry\u2019s mother.\"  Monica Schipper // Getty Images  But what of Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Perry? Despite his death being shown in the season one finale, the actor was notably coy when asked about the second series at the Golden Globes.  \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m really dead or not,\u201d he told NBC. \"We'll see.\"  Watch this space...  In terms of other new characters, Crystal R Fox has been cast as Bonnie Carlson's mother, Elizabeth Howard, Mo McRae will play Michael Perkins, a new teacher at Otter Bay Elementary School and finally, Douglas Smith will be joining the cast as an \"off-beat surfer, aspiring marine biologist and Jane\u2019s co-worker\" Corey Brockfield.  Will there be a third series?  Although it seemed unlikely that Big Little Lies would even have a second series given it was initially based on one book, a third series has been ruled out entirely.  \u201cThere's no such plan now (for a season three),\"Big Little Lies executive producer and showrunner David E. Kelly said during the show's appearance at the 2019 TCA winter press tour. \"We like where our closure is at the end of season 2.\u201d",

        "doc_1_text": "The second season of Big Little Lies already has a massive fan following that's looking for news and spoilers like a Monterey seagull searching for food. Sadly, not too much is known about the new season, which is set to premiere on HBO sometime in 2019, but fans can already tell it's going to be a good one, probably for two reasons. First, it's Big Little Lies, so, duh, and secondly, Meryl Streep will be on season two so double duh. And, though she didn't open up about what will go down the mansions of Monterey next year in a recent interview with Variety, Nicole Kidman did reveal how Meryl Streep got involved with Big Little Lies. Two words: her emails.  Well, considering that today's news literally reports that Ivanka Trump used her personal email account for government business, this isn't really the time for a \"her emails\" joke. In this case, though, emails are pretty funny for once. Speaking with Variety, Kidman revealed that Streep emailed her and Reese Witherspoon on the night of the 2018 Golden Globes. After Big Little Lies won the award for Best Television Limited Series, Streep said in her email, \"I suppose now I have to join you.\" Kidman continues, saying, \"We were like, \u2018What?\u2019 The two of us were just shocked.\" Now that is one email chain that definitely should get published as a series of short stories \u2014 or perhaps it could turn into a one act play.  Kidman also told Variety that Streep had signed onto Season 2 without even reading the script, something Kidman has spoken about before, because, as the actor said, \"That\u2019s how much she wanted to support us.\" With Season 1 of Big Little Lies ending with a rousing show of female solidarity, it seems like Season 2 will carry on that same energy, at least behind-the-scenes, that is.  Again, not much about BLL Season 2 is known except for the fact that it is happening in 2019, but last January, Entertainment Weekly revealed that Streep will play Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Kidman\u2019s character, Celeste Wright. A quick mental family tree mapping will tell you that that means that Streep's character is Alexander Skarsgard\u2019s character, Perry Wright's mom. Spoilers from Season 1 ahead.  According to The Hollywood Reporter, Streep's character in Season 2 will arrive in Monterey in order to find out more information about Perry's death. It definitely sounds like things could get tense between Kidman and Streep's characters, and in her interview with Variety, Kidman revealed that she felt a little bit of tension herself in anticipation of filming alongside a legend like Streep. \"I was terrified,\" Kidman said, before adding, \"You\u2019re acting opposite the great one. I get nervous anyway \u2014 but to be opposite her and not want her to think, \u2018Who is this amateur?'\" There was also pressure to deliver material worthy of Streep's participation, something Kidman said she and Witherspoon were all too aware of. \"And also, we want to deliver a series for her that she\u2019s great in,\" she said. \"Reese and I were like, \u2018We want this for her and for the other women.\u2019 They have much stronger roles in the second one.\"  Considering that Kidman earned both an Emmy and a Golden Globe award for her role in the HBO miniseries for its first season, it's safe to say that she had nothing to worry about. But stronger roles for each of the women in Season 2 \u2014 and the addition of Meryl Streep \u2014 makes the future for Big Little Lies sound better than ever.",

Even though the series leads, Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, and Laura Dern, have consistently promoted female power throughout the promotion of the series and awards season, it seems as if jealousy may still be rearing its ugly head.  \u201cNicole feels she\u2019s the star of the show and is threatened by Meryl,\u201d the source revealed to Closer. \u201cMeryl\u2019s picked up on it and the two have really gotten into it\u2026. [They had] an epic falling-out.\u201d  Kidman, 50, won multiple awards for her portrayal of Big Little Lies\u2018 Celeste Wright, including an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild award. She has only one Oscar though, which was for her role in The Hours.  Meanwhile, 58-year-old Streep is highly revered in Hollywood and has been nominated for an Oscar an outstanding 21 times, with three total wins. She officially joined the cast in January, playing Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Kidman\u2019s character, who has come to town to make sure her grandchildren are okay following the death of their father/her son, played in Season 1 by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd.  When it was first announced that Streep would be joining the series, Kidman posted a photo of the two of them together to her Instagram page and said, \u201cWelcome to the [Big Little Lies] family Ms. Streep \u2014 can\u2019t wait.\u201d  If the rumors are true though, somewhere along the line, something changed.  \u201cTheir feud is affecting the entire series,\u201d the Closer source said. \u201cTension on the set is at an all-time high.\u201d  One factor that may be playing a role in the on-set tension is salary.  For the first season of Big Little Lies, sources told the Hollywood Reporter that Kidman and Witherspoon each received between $250,000 and $350,000 per episode, along with executive producer fees.  Even though their Season 2 per episode rate has reportedly gone up to $1 million, Streep will make around $800,000 per episode, according to Variety, which is way more than Kidman received during her first year on the HBO series.  Possibly trying to stop these rumors from spreading, Witherspoon posted a picture to Instagram of herself, Kidman, Streep, and Woodley smiling all together at a bowling alley last week.  \u201cWe work and we play! Bowl-a-Rama party with the ladies of [Big Little Lies],\u201d she captioned the pic.  Based on the novel, Big Little Lies, by Liane Moriarty, David E. Kelley originally created and wrote HBO\u2019s take on the book as a limited series. After quickly becoming a favorite of both critics and TV viewers, and winning a slew of prestigious awards, HBO announced in December that it would air a second season of the drama, slated to premiere sometime in 2019.  \u201cThe way things are going, who knows if there will be a third season?\u201d the Closer source said.",

Original series star Nicole Kidman and newcomer Meryl Streep are reportedly at odds, causing tension on the set and affecting the entire project.\n\nAccording to a source close to the show, Kidman, who won multiple awards for her portrayal of Big Little Lies' Celeste Wright, feels threatened by Streep's addition to the series. Streep, who was announced to join the cast in January, plays the mother-in-law of Kidman's character, and their characters' relationship could be a source of tension in the upcoming season.\n\nKidman and Streep's reported feud is not the only thing making headlines for Big Little Lies. The series, based on the novel by Liane Moriarty, has already earned a massive fan following and will likely have another successful season. The second season is set to premiere on HBO sometime in 2019, and fans are eagerly anticipating what will happen in Monterey.\n\nWhile Kidman revealed that Streep signed onto the series without even reading the script, something she mentioned before, the actress did not specify why. Streep's character, Mary Louise Wright, is set to arrive in Monterey in order to find out more information about Perry's death, which could put her at odds with Kidman's character, Celeste Wright.\n\nKidman has previously spoken about the pressure to deliver material worthy of Streep's participation, and the actress is aware of the pressure to deliver strong performances. With stronger roles for each of the women in Season 2 and the addition of Streep, Big Little Lies sounds like it will have another successful season.",

In fact, he recently appeared in some season two photos taken on set, and when he was asked about it during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, he took time to address it \u2014 sort of.

Why can we do that, you ask? Well, as it happens, both Witherspoon and Dern connected on Twitter recently to brainstorm some adorable and unconventional Big Little Lies Season 2 ideas \u2014 and we\u2019re living for it.  On Dec. 14, Dern posted a video from her Star Wars: The Last Jedi promotional duties where she has a cute moment with the most twee droid of them all, BB-8. Witherspoon, not missing a beat, tweeted at her, \u201cI love him! Can BB8 be in BLL2?\u201d  I love him ! Can BB8 be in BLL2? \u2014 Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) December 14, 2017    Of course, Dern saw an easy way to bring the worlds of Star Wars and Big Little Lies together, and she didn\u2019t hesitate to pitch her idea to Witherspoon right away. \u201cUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy!\u201d.  Um\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy! \u2014 Laura Dern (@LauraDern) December 14, 2017    OK, this idea is actually amazing and yes, now I will need Amabella to get a BB-8 in Big Little Lies Season 2 or else all will be for naught.  Original story, published Sept. 18, 2017: The internet seems to think that something is brewing between Big Little Lies stars Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, and it\u2019s not at all friendly. This is, of course, speculative and incredibly problematic to say the least, if only because the speculation is looking to pit two women against one another for no good reason. Because Dern didn\u2019t embrace Witherspoon and suddenly that\u2019s a sign of a feud? It sounds fishy, folks.  Speculation began brewing on Sunday night at the 69th Primetime Emmys when Dern skipped over Witherspoon as she received congratulations after winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. When Dern was announced as the winner, a curious thing happened: She passed right over Witherspoon.  More: Is Big Little Lies Season 2 Actually a Good Idea?  It\u2019s traditional during an awards show, especially one like the Emmys or Oscars where big groups related to a project show up, that the winner might take a moment to get hugs and kisses from their dates or co-stars before going up onstage. Considering the established narrative of how close the women of Big Little Lies are in real life, to see Dern get announced as the winner and move right over Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman (seated in front of Witherspoon) is interesting and noteworthy, but it\u2019s not exactly damning proof that Dern loathes Witherspoon, is it?

First off, Dern\u2019s nerves may have gotten the best of her. There\u2019s a chance she just kind of quickly hugged the first people she saw before making her way to the stage so she could give her proper thanks. Second of all, there\u2019s a chance that maybe Dern and Witherspoon are cool but perhaps they just don\u2019t show their affection for one another in that way. There\u2019s also reason to believe that the cameras focused on Dern after Witherspoon acknowledge her and congratulated her.  More: One Big Little Lies Star Might Run for Congress  Listen, at the end of the day, there\u2019s most likely nothing here; the internet is talking about a problem that simply isn\u2019t there. There\u2019s no need to blow something entirely out of proportion \u2014 however interesting or somewhat shady it may be \u2014 when it could risk painting two women whom we otherwise love and who have not been prone to catty behavior in public before this with a broad brush.",

        "doc_1_text": "When the first season of Big Little Lies ended in the spring of 2017, fans of the buzzy miniseries figured that was that. After all, the debut season was marketed as a one-off miniseries, and it had adapted the entirety of the Liane Moriarty novel on which is was based. But months later, HBO surprised us all by revealing the show would get a second season. While we are still waiting for this new season to premiere, now fans are left with another pressing question: how much longer will the show go on? Will Big Little Lies Season 3 happen or is Season 2 where we will have to say goodbye to Monterey? Nicole Kidman talked about the future of the series in a recent interview, and it does not sound like fans should hold out much hope for more new seasons.  The biggest hurdle to keeping Big Little Lies going after its upcoming second season, it sounds like, is the hectic schedules of the cast. The ensemble drama boasts one of the most star-studded casts on television, and all of its stars are still putting out multiple blockbuster or critically acclaimed movies each year alongside their new TV jobs. The cast includes Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz, among others, and Season 2 will see none other than Meryl Streep joining the series as well.  With all of those huge names, it is not easy to block out time for production on Big Little Lies, and unfortunately, that might make Season 2 the last season of the show. In a new profile with Variety, Nicole Kidman said that although she and her costars would love to make a third season, she thinks that getting everyone back together could be difficult:  I think it would be hard to get the whole group together. But we would love to do it.  HBO  Another reason that Big Little Lies may not continue for much longer is the fact that it was only originally intended to run for one season. After fully telling the story of Liane Moriarty's Big Little Lies novel in Season 1, Moriarty penned a brand new continuation to her book once HBO announced it was picking up a second season.  The plot for the upcoming season is a big mystery for fans, but we do know it will most likely center on the group of women trying to keep quiet about the murder of Celeste Wright's abusive husband, Perry. Season 1 ended with Bonnie Carlson pushing Perry down a flight of stairs to his death, and the group of moms agreeing to keep the murder a secret to protect Bonnie. Although they seemed to manage to get the police off their scent, Meryl Streep will be playing Perry's mother, Mary Louise Wright, in Season 2, and her arrival in Monterey is sure to complicate matters.  A bigger mystery still is when Season 2 of Big Little Lies will finally premiere. The new season filmed throughout this past summer, and is set to premiere sometime in 2019.",

May 29, 2018  AceShowbiz - A real drama is reportedly brewing on the set of \"Big Little Lies\". As filming on the show's second season is underway, tension is mounting between Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep, according to In Touch (via Life&Style).  There's allegedly a power struggle between Witherspoon, who also executive produces the show, and Streep, who just joins the cast for season 2. The 42-year-old star is said acting like she was the star of the show and it causes the situation awkward with her other co-stars. \"I could tell Reese thinks she wears the pants,\" says a so-called insider. \"There's definitely a power struggle between them.\"  Recently, Witherspoon and Streep along with their co-stars Nicole Kidman, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern were seen having dinner together. The eyewitness says Reese was \"really unfriendly\" to everyone at the table during the dinner outing.  The news about the alleged tension between Witherspoon and Streep is a bit bizarre though, as the former previously expressed her excitement to have the three-time Academy Award-winning actress starring on \"Big Little Lies\".  \"I called Nicole and I was like, 'Is this real life? Is this really happening?' And then I got off the phone with Nicole and I, like, hugged myself gently for a minute,\" she said on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\". \"And said, 'This is really happening. You're really working with Meryl Streep.' \"  Witherspoon reprises her role as Madeline Martha Mackenzie, while Streep is tapped to portray Mary Louise Wright, Celeste's (Kidman) mother-in-law and the mother of Celeste's abusive husband, Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgard), who was presumed dead in the first season.  Shailene Woodley is back as Jane Chapman, Laura Dern returns as Renata Klein and Zoe Kravitz still portrays Bonnie Carlson. Adam Scott is also set to reprise his role as Ed Mackenzie, Madeline's husband.  In the upcoming second season of the Emmy-winning series, Madeline is said to be confronting the truth of Perry's death and coming to terms with her own marriage and traditional notions of marriage. Meanwhile, Celeste is still reeling from her husband's death, \"adrift, but determined to fight for her family and find the woman she once was.\"  The 7-episode season 2 of \"Big Little Lies\" reportedly will arrive in 2019.

According to In Touch, there is a power struggle between Witherspoon, who also executive produces the show, and Streep, who recently joined the cast for season 2. The source claims that Witherspoon is acting like she is the star of the show and causing tension with her co-stars. However, Witherspoon previously expressed her excitement to have Streep on the show, saying \"This is really happening. You're really working with Meryl Streep.\"\n\nWitherspoon reprises her role as Madeline Martha Mackenzie, while Streep is tapped to portray Mary Louise Wright, Celeste's (Nicole Kidman) mother-in-law and the mother of Celeste's abusive husband, Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgard), who was presumed dead in the first season. Season 2 of Big Little Lies is set to arrive in 2019 and will reportedly center on the group of women trying to keep quiet about the murder of Celeste's husband, Perry. However, Kidman recently spoke about the future of the series, revealing that it may be difficult to get the entire cast together for a third season due to their hectic schedules, and that the upcoming season may be the last.",

Normally sporting long blonde locks, the Moulin Rouge star is seen in a scene from her new film Destroyer, in which she plays LAPD detective Erin Bell.  And it\u2019s quite the departure from the Kidman we\u2019re used to seeing on the red carpet.  The star is sat with a dark, choppy wig, no glamourous makeup and a plain top as she stares off into the distance.  Kidman\u2019s new role is bound to be compelling (Picture: Annapurna Pictures)  She\u2019s sporting weathered bags under her eyes, with a stern look of worry etched across her face.  In the upcoming movie, Nicole\u2019s character is traumatised after going undercover in a criminal gang, which might explain the vibe we\u2019re seeing here.  Furthermore, Destroyer\u2019s director Karyn Kusama told Vanity Fair she wanted Kidman\u2019s character\u2019s trauma to be shown in her appearance, 20 years after initially going undercover.  \u2018We always knew that what we wanted her to look like was a real middle-aged woman with a past that she wears on her face,\u2019 she said.  \u2018With sun damage and sleep deprivation and stress and rage, just in her whole physical body.\u2019  Kusama added Kidman isn\u2019t the biggest fan of such drastic makeover, so they had to be quick with their work for her character.  She said: \u2018Ironically, she also hates being in the makeup chair. She just wants to be on set working. So we had to make it as short an application as possible.\u2019  It\u2019s not the first time Kidman has undertaken a massive makeover for a role, after she donned prosthetics to play tortured author Virginia Woolf in The Hours.  That role won her the Academy Award for Actress in a Leading Role, so who knows that doors this latest venture might open up.  Meanwhile, Kidman has just wrapped filming on the second season of Big Little Lies.  Addressing her 1.7million followers, she said: \u2018That\u2019s a wrap on #BigLittleLies Season 2 filming! What a beautiful journey this has been with my Monterey 5 sisters and our passionate dedicated crew.  \u2018Thank you HBO for the amazing opportunity and thank you Andrea Arnold for being our fearless leader, and of course the one and only Meryl Streep for believing in us. I love you all. xx\u2019  Most of the original cast is expected to return including Reese Witherspoon, Nicole, Shailene, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern. Adam Scott has also confirmed that he will return as Madeline\u2019s husband, Ed.  And we cannot wait.  Got a showbiz story?

        "doc_2_text": "Saturday Night Live has seen some major gains in the ratings this season, and it could be argued that some of the gains, at least, have something to do with Alec Baldwin's well-known and widely seen impersonation of Donald Trump. In a recent profile, Baldwin revealed that while he doesn't write the Trump-based sketches, he is paid a pretty nice fee for popping up for just a few minutes on NBC's late night sketch comedy series. In fact, he's paid $1,400 per episode.  As of this past weekend's Casey Affleck and Chance the Rapper-led episode, Alec Baldwin has appeared in six credited episodes of SNL playing Donald Trump and two uncredited episodes. Let's say he's been paid for six episodes. While $8,400 isn't a hefty sum for an acting gig---and is probably a very low sum compared to the money Baldwin makes for other TV gigs, not to mention commercials---it's still good money for a very limited amount of work.  In fact, Alec Baldwin told the NY Times, that there's really only one key to playing the Presidential incumbate, and it's not a wild-looking wig. It's actually just pausing at the right times to look for a word.  I see a guy who seems to pause and dig for the more precise and better language he wants to use, and never finds it. It's the same dish --- it's a grilled-cheese sandwich rhetorically over and over again.  Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump portrayal has certainly been popular with some factions and not with others, but it's safe to say that is should live on as an example of a classic Saturday Night Live character for some time to come. So, even though Alec Baldwin is only making $1,400 bucks to show up to practice and plan for each new Trump-based sketch, plus to perform during that inconvenient late night airing on Saturday night, he's certainly earning brownie points in other places. We're still talking about Tina Fey's Sarah Palin impression years and years later. Anticipate the same thing will happen for Alec Baldwin and Trump--especially if he continues the impression during the duration of Donald Trump's new gig.  Regardless of what Alec Baldwin has been getting paid for his Trump impression, we still anticipate that the former 30 Rock actor will be popping up in Studio 8H after the days of his Presidential impression are long over. Baldwin has been a friend of Saturday Night Live for a long time, and hosted the series well before Lorne Michaels decided he would be a good fit for this particular role. Expect him to be around in the future.  Currently Saturday Night Live is on winter hiatus on NBC. Enjoy the holidays in the meantime, and you can catch new episodes starting on Saturday, January 14 on NBC. To find out who is coming up as the host on Saturday Night Live head here.

        "generated_text": "Alec Baldwin's Impersonation of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live Earns Him a Nice Fee\n\nThis season, Saturday Night Live has seen a significant boost in ratings, and it could be argued that some of these gains can be attributed to Alec Baldwin's well-known and widely seen impersonation of Donald Trump. In a recent profile, Baldwin revealed that he is paid a fee for popping up for just a few minutes on the NBC's late night sketch comedy series. He is paid $1,400 per episode, and as of this past weekend's Casey Affleck and Chance the Rapper-led episode, he has appeared in six credited episodes of SNL playing Donald Trump and two uncredited episodes.\n\nWhile $8,400 isn't a hefty sum for an acting gig, and is probably a very low sum compared to the money Baldwin makes for other TV gigs, not to mention commercials, it's still good money for a very limited amount of work. Baldwin told the NY Times that the key to playing the Presidential incumbent is not a wild-looking wig, but rather pausing at the right times to look for a word.\n\nBaldwin's Donald Trump portrayal has been popular with some factions and not with others, but it's safe to say that it should live on as an example of a classic Saturday Night Live character for some time to come. Even though Alec Baldwin is only making $1,400 to show up to practice and plan for each new Trump-based sketch, plus to perform during that inconvenient late night airing on Saturday night, he's certainly earning brownie points in other places.\n\nBaldwin has been a friend of Saturday Night Live for a long time, and hosted the series well before Lorne Michaels decided he would be a good fit for this particular role. Expect him to be around in the future. Currently, Saturday Night Live is on winter hiatus on NBC.\n\nIn other TV news, HBO's hit show Big Little Lies is thankfully coming back for a second season, and production has finally begun. Reese Witherspoon recently shared that filming was set to begin over the weekend, and the cast wasted no time sharing a piece of the action with fans. Last night, Witherspoon and Laura Dern posted matching photos on Instagram, showing their characters Madeline Martha Mckenzie (Witherspoon) and Renata Klein (Dern) hanging out at their favorite Seaside Coffee Shop. Witherspoon captioned the photo \"Watch out Monterey, here we come!\" Dern captioned her photo \"Madeline and Renata are back.\" Zo\u00eb Kravitz, who plays Bonnie Carlson on the show, posted the first look at filming with a selfie captioned \"Bonnie's. Back.\" Shailene Woodley, who plays Jane Chapman, followed suit with a picture captioned \"JANES BACK.\" Nicole Kidman has yet to post from set, but she's been active on Instagram ever since creating an account in January. We hope this means we'll hear from Celeste Wright very soon.",

New Idea claims that the Legally Blonde star is unhappy with her Australian, Big Little Lies co-star's failure to promote the HBO series in the run-up to its debut in February, claiming that Nicole used too much of her airtime to discuss her latest Hollywood hit, Lion.  \"Reese is furious that Nicole hasn't done more to support Big Little Lies.

According to the publication, frosty relations between the pair manifested themselves at the Oscars last month. \"You could cut the tension with a knife at the Oscars. Nicole was telling her people to keep Reese away from her,\" claimed the source.

They're (Reese and Nicole) great friends, they love each other and they love the way each other works.\"  Another source has denied New Idea's claims that Nicole had not been promoting the show as much as fellow cast members, saying that the 49-year-old did a 'shed load' of publicity both in America and abroad.

The win joined earlier trophies for Best Actress Nicole Kidman, Best Supporting Actress Laura Dern and Best Supporting Actor Alexander Skarsgard. The hardware haul tonight follows eight Emmy Awards back in September and comes amid the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, making the series seem even more relevant.  Time\u2019s Up, a group of 300 women in the entertainment industry that recently started a legal defense fund for sexual harassment claims, was cited out by Big Little Lies star and exec producer Reese Witherspoon upon accepting the Limited Series Globe. \u201cThis show is so much about the life we present to the world that could be very different than the life we live behind closed doors,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I want to thank everyone who broke their silence this year and spoke up about abuse and harassment. You are so brave. And hopefully shows like this, more will be made so people out there who are feeling silenced by harassment, discrimination, abuse: Time is up. We see you, we hear you and we will tell your stories.\u201d  Based on Liane Moriarty\u2019s novel, the David E Kelley-scripted, Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e-directed Big Little Lies tells the story of a group of women in a tight-knit, well-heeled community in Monterey, CA. When a murder rocks the gossipy residents, the fragile truths behind their picture-perfect lives threaten to be exposed.  Kelley said tonight, \u201cThis one\u2019s been a real joy. It started with Liane\u2019s great book, HBO\u2019s unflinching support\u201d and Vall\u00e9e. \u201cHe took this material into his heart and more importantly he delivered it from his heart elevating every page, every performance,\u201d Kelley added, noting, \u201cAs for the cast, take a look at this cast, many of which have already been honored but two of which are also ferocious producers, Nicole and Reese.\u201d  The series is getting a second installment with a seven-episode order coming through in early December. Back for the follow-up are Kidman and Witherspoon as well Kelley who again is penning all of the scripts partially based on a story by Moriarty. Andrea Arnold is directing.  When the greenlight was announced, Witherspoon said, \u201cIt gives us the opportunity to delve deeper into the lives of these intriguing and intricate Monterey families and bring more of their stories back to the audience who embraced and championed them.\u201d  Added Kidman, \u201cThis is inspired by the overwhelming response by audiences around the world, conceived once again by Liane Moriarty, realized by David Kelley and now in the hands of visionary filmmaker Andrea Arnold.

Know more about their Relationship  Nicole Kidman who is an Australian actress and film producer and Keith Urban who is a New Zealand-born Australian-American country musician got married which is the obvious thing.  They got married on Christmas Eve 1990 in Telluride, Colorado.  The couple has been enjoying married life and still going strong. They have been publicly seen and have shown their love for each other. They have two daughters together and live happily as a family.  However, since Nicole has starred in the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d there has been a lot of rumors going around about Keith Being jealous and upset.  Rumor of the Separation  There has been a rumor going on about Keith being upset with Nicole for the Sex scene in the TV series Big Little Lies (BLL). Many sites claimed this news to be true as well. They have been using a certain source to make them correct. Let\u2019s see how much of this rumor is true!  According to the National Enquirer, the country singer is troubled by his wife\u2019s many racy sex scenes with Alexander Skarsgard, who plays her husband on the show.  A so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine,  \u201cKeith must be going nuts with jealousy watching his wife expose her naked body to another actor, and the world!\u201d  An insider adds,  \u201cHe\u2019s in showbiz, too, so he knows there are things you have to do sometimes, but it can\u2019t be easy for him.\u201d  Fake News Viral  There are many sites likewise that have confused many fans of the star by giving false reports. There have been many cases where the news is made so believable but actually, all of it is fake.  For this kind of site, there is a Gossip cop which always finds the source and corrects all of this fake news. For this news as well Gossip cop has found that Keith Urban is NOT upset about Nicole Kidman\u2019s sex scenes on the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d despite a made-up tabloid report.  However, in a trustworthy source close to the situation assures us that Urban isn\u2019t at all distressed about the show\u2019s sexually explicit content.  When Kidman was asked by E! News last month about her husband\u2019s reaction to her sex scenes, the actress responded,  \u201cHe\u2019s an artist, so he knows that the work is the work.\u201d  After all this, still, those sites are feeding that fake news. They are celebrities and it\u2019s their work. It is understandable as her husband Keith is also an artist.  Additionally, Gossip Cop already busted the Enquirer for a similarly bogus report published last year when \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was still in production.  At the time, the publication falsely claimed that Urban was upset about Kidman\u2019s on-set kiss with Alexander Skarsgard, but there was no truth to the story then, and it isn\u2019t accurate now.  Similar Report  When BLL was currently in the process there was similar news about Keith being \u201cHeartBroken\u201d over Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgard kissing on the set of a TV show, which we already know that it is just false news. But despite both being professional actors in a scripted romance, the National Enquirer is trying to create real-life drama.  One of the sources tells the tabloid,  \u201cKeith will be heartbroken\u2026 Though they were [kissing] on set, there\u2019s no denying the intense connection that grew between Nicole and Alexander. Given her and Keith\u2019s problems, I worry that this will put their marriage into a tailspin.\u201d  The magazine\u2019s insider goes on to claim that during some takes, Kidman and Skarsgard would keep kissing \u201cpast the director\u2019s call to \u2018cut!\u2019\u201d  First of all, there are no \u2018problems\u2019 in Kidman and Urban\u2019s marriage. Gossip Cop has repeatedly called out the Enquirer for trying to create a non-existent rift between the two, who remain happily married month after month following these false claims.  It was again debunked by the Gossip Cop as the news was false. As they are happy and there is no situation causing marriage trouble, despite a ridiculous tabloid report.

In the Big Little Lies finale titled \u201cYou Get What You Need,\u201d we finally find out who died\u2014as well as the identity of the killer. During an intense argument on the roof of the school, Bonnie (Zo\u00eb Kravitz) shoves Perry (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), causing him to plummet to his death.  This ending was the culmination of a narrative that kept Monterey\u2019s most glamorous moms and dads in the dark about Perry\u2019s behavior. Until that night, no one knew that he abused his wife, Celeste (Nicole Kidman), and sexually assaulted Jane (Shailene Woodley), resulting in the birth of her son.  A rapid chain of events on the night of the least fun trivia night in history all led to Perry\u2019s demise. Here\u2019s a rundown of exactly what happened.  Celeste\u2019s choice:  Celeste learns that her son Max was bullying Amabella, tragically emulating his father\u2019s abusive behavior. (Remember the stuffed animal\u2019s missing limb?) This revelation is the pivotal crack in her denial that the twins were safe from Perry\u2019s violence. Later on, Perry discovers that as he feared, Celeste is leaving him. She scrambles to set her hastily prepared escape plan in motion before the party.  Ill-advised karaoke:  During Ed\u2019s (Adam Scott) cringe-inducing song to Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), she\u2019s so overcome by guilt about cheating on him that she races to the caution-taped site of her affair with Joseph. Jane runs after her, and consoles her. Sporting the most elaborate Audrey Hepburn costume ever, Renata (Laura Dern) interrupts and apologizes to Jane for mistreating her. Celeste joins them. Perry arrives soon after, ordering her to the car. She refuses to go, insisting on staying with her friends. Bonnie hangs back and surveils the scene from a level above everyone.  Shailene Woodley and Reese Witherspoon in Big Little Lies. Hilary Bronwyn Gayle\u2014HBO  The struggle:  In a chilling moment, Perry is revealed to be Jane\u2019s rapist, as the horror on her face registers at the sight of him. Celeste quickly puts this information together as well. Enraged, Perry hits Celeste. Madeline and Renata try to restrain them, but he lashes out at them too. Bonnie races to the scene and shoves him, ultimately costing Perry his life. He tumbles down the concrete stairs to his death.  The end:  The show caps off with coordinated testimonies proving the core group doesn\u2019t rat out Bonnie, who a detective says could potentially face community service for involuntary manslaughter. Perry\u2019s death leaves his family on the road to recovery with a little help from the other moms. And help, the curtain dropper assures fans, is something that each mom will have. In this tidy ending, they all play at the beach, moving on together.",

After he proposed to an accepting Becca Kufrin on the pretaped March 5 episode, it was revealed on the post-finale After the Final Rose special that Luyendyk had changed his mind.  After a two-month engagement, Luyendyk called off his relationship with Kufrin during a difficult-to-watch on-camera breakup that played out unedited and ran for nearly an hour. He then turned around and proposed a second time on live television to Burnham, who accepted.  \u201cGoing back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn\u2019t a popular decision,\u201d Luyendyk explained, \u201cbut it was a decision I had to make for myself. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a TV show but this is the rest of our lives, and Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with.\u201d  The choices made by Luyendyk and producers to ambush Kufrin, and by ABC to air the breakup footage, sent backlash Luyendyk\u2019s way and turned off some fans of the franchise.

Not only the good things but also the bad things. Just because [with] the finale, there\u2019s always a lot of questions. When [former Bachelor] Jason Mesnick changed his mind \u2014 he\u2019s happy and has kids and a great life \u2014 they didn\u2019t film anything and fans were upset by that. I really wanted everyone to see our love story and I think the editing chose to show more of the breakup than the happy parts of that ending.\u201d  Burnham admitted that she knew Luyendyk was going to break up with Kufrin, but that filming the heartbreaks are part of what they signed up for.  \u201cI knew he was going to break up with Becca and I knew that production was involved, so I kind of figured that\u2019s what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the whole thing was taped.

Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Luyendyk Jr., 36, and Burnham, 26, were at the epicenter of the most recent (and most controversial!) season of The Bachelor. Less than two months after proposing to finalist Becca Kufrin, Luyendyk Jr. realized he was still in love with his runner-up, Burnham. He ultimately decided to break things off with Kufrin, 28, to pursue a relationship with Burnham \u2014 and proposed to her on live television during the two-hour After the Final Rose special on March 6.  Since then, all three parties involved have moved on. Kufrin is engaged once again, this time after wrapping production on The Bachelorette (her season premieres Monday on ABC), and Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham have moved in together in his hometown of Scottsdale, Arizona.  \u201cWe\u2019re in our condo now and we just bought a new house,\u201d Burnham said on The View. \u201cThings are moving pretty quickly and everything\u2019s been great.\u201d  The couple also admitted that they have yet to watch their season finale \u2014 including the painfully raw footage of Luyendyk Jr. ending things with Kufrin.  \u201cI think going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn\u2019t a popular decision. But it was a decision I had to make for myself. \u2026 I knew that Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with,\u201d said Luyendyk Jr. \u201cI never watched the finale, so we don\u2019t really know how that breakup looked on TV. But breakups are hard, and I think that everyone handles it in a different way. They say it was unedited, but it was edited. You\u2019re not in control of the editing room and you can\u2019t really control what they show.\u201d  \u201cMy breakup was taped, everyone else\u2019s was, and that\u2019s just kind of the name of the game,\u201d added Burnham.  And Luyendyk Jr. said he thinks his relationship with Burnham is even more solid because of what they went through.  \u201cI think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn\u2019t change it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy. When we go out in public, it\u2019s all positivity. And that\u2019s cool to see.\u201d  \u201cOur relationship is so unique and it\u2019s nothing that I\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d added Burnham. \u201cSo the fact that he was willing to take that risk and all of America hating him to be with me, that means a lot to me.\u201d  Opening up exclusively to PEOPLE after the scandal, Luyendyk Jr. admitted he wholeheartedly regretted proposing to Kufrin while he was still in love with Burnham.

Fans criticized Tristan for choosing to date a Kardashian and even said he'll be affected by the so-called \"Kardashian curse\" that plagues exes of the famous family.

Sources exclusively told Life & Style that Khlo\u00e9 might not walk down the aisle as quickly as she thought. It seems that Tristan experienced a last-minute change of heart, leaving Khlo\u00e9 feeling like she was left at the altar.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers player was set to marry his reality star girlfriend, but things fell apart just before the NBA Finals. Fans criticized Tristan for dating a Kardashian, and some even blamed her for his team's loss against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nDespite the negative attention, Khlo\u00e9 hasn't lost hope in her happily-ever-after. She has reconciled with Tristan and things have cooled in their relationship. However, Tristan doesn't seem as convinced that he wants to get married, but he loves her and doesn't want to throw it all away.\n\nOn the other hand, Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham are officially engaged and will be tying the knot next year in Hawaii. The couple announced their engagement on The View and revealed that their wedding will take place on January 12th, 2023. They are excited to take the next step in their relationship and are best friends.\n\nLuyendyk Jr. and Burnham were at the epicenter of the most recent season of The Bachelor. Less than two months after proposing to finalist Becca Kufrin, Luyendyk Jr. realized he was still in love with his runner-up, Burnham. He ultimately decided to break things off with Kufrin to pursue a relationship with Burnham, and proposed to her on live television during the two-hour After the Final Rose special on March 6. Since then, all three parties involved have moved on. Kufrin is engaged once again, and Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham have moved in together in his hometown of Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nBurnham told PEOPLE that she respects Luyendyk Jr.'s decision to follow his heart. She added that it has made their relationship stronger and she knows that he truly wants to be with her. Luyendyk Jr. also revealed that he wants to start a family, and Burnham said that they are both \"very excited\" about the prospect of marriage and having children.\n\nOverall, it seems that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's relationship has faced a lot of pressure, but they have yet to announce whether they will be getting married or not. On the other hand, Arie and Lauren's relationship seems to be stronger because of the drama they went through. It's unclear what the future holds for these couples, but we wish them all the best.",

        "doc_1_text": "I use apple cider vinegar a lot. From making cleaning recipes to its many health benefits, ACV is a staple in our home.  For cleaning, any vinegar will do. In food or drink recipes though, I always use an organic and unrefined version of apple cider vinegar with \u201cthe Mother.\u201d  Over the years, my mentions of \u201cvinegar with the mother,\u201d have gotten a lot of questions. Readers ask what \u201cthe mother\u201d means and how to find it, so I wanted to fully explain exactly what it is and why it is important.  Here\u2019s why:  What is Apple Cider Vinegar with The Mother?  In short, it is apple cider vinegar that still has the culture of beneficial bacteria that turns regular apple cider into vinegar in the first place. This is similar to the SCOBY (also called a \u201cmother\u201d) in Kombucha making.  Pasteurized vs. Unrefined & Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar  In ACV particularly, \u201cthe mother\u201d is a complex structure of beneficial acids that seem to have health benefits. Unrefined vinegars have a murky appearance and typically still contain the mother culture. Clear and pasteurized vinegars typically do not contain the mother culture and don\u2019t carry the same benefits.  Refined and clear vinegars are great for cleaning as they don\u2019t leave residue. Raw, unfiltered and unrefined versions contain many more beneficial properties for culinary uses.  How Apple Cider Vinegar is Made  The word vinegar comes from the latin words vinum (wine) and acer (sour) and in essence vinegar is just that: sour wine.  Organic unfiltered vinegars have a long history of use, having been discovered thousands of years ago!  Folklore claims that Cleopatra once dissolved a pearl in vinegar and drank it in order to win a bet with Marcus Antonius (Marc Antony). She wagered that she could spend a fortune on a single meal. Vinegar is mention in the Bible and Hippocrates often recommended it for a variety of ailments.  Any carbohydrate or alcohol in theory can become vinegar. Carbohydrates are made into an alcohol through a process of careful fermentation.  The (non-distilled) alcohol in beer, wine or cider is exposed to air and a group of bacteria (acetobacter) that convert the alcohols into acetic acid.  In unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar, this beneficial group of bacteria and acids remains and creates the murky web-like \u201cMother.\u201d  This type of vinegar gained commercial popularity in the 1930s:  In 1394, a group of French vintners developed a continuous method for making vinegar called the Orleans method. In this method, oak barrels were used as fermentation vessels and the vinegar was siphoned off through a spigot at the bottom of the barrel. About 15% of the vinegar was left behind which contained the \u201cmother of vinegar\u201d and its concentrated bacteria floating on top. A new batch of cider or wine was carefully added to the barrel and was quick started by the remaining vinegar. (source)  This is similar to the process for continuous brew kombucha, and at the time, it allowed these Frenchmen to satisfy the growing market for vinegars. They went on to create infused vinegars with herbs, spices, and fruits to meet the growing demand.  Benefits of The Mother in Apple Cider Vinegar  As with many things in nature, vinegar in its unfiltered, unadulterated and unrefined form has a variety of benefits that are lost when it is filtered and heated.  The acetic acid created in the secondary fermentation process is a component of the finished vinegar and has a host of benefits on its own. Certain medications contain acetic acid in concentrated form and studies have looked at the role of acetic acid in balancing blood sugar, blood pressure and dissolving cholesterol deposits in arteries.  More research is needed, but acetic acid in vinegar has a long history of use in alternative medicine.  Cleaning and Preserving  The high acid content in vinegar makes it a powerful preservative for food and it is often also recommended in cleaning for this reason. In fact, historically, vinegars were added to water to make the water more drinkable.  It is important to note that vinegar has some limitations as a natural cleaner and that it is not a registered disinfectant for disinfecting uses. A hydrogen peroxide based formula is a better choice and strong natural soaps (like this one) are better for degreasing.  Digestive Support  Digestive problems and acid reflux can often be from too little stomach acid rather than too much. Apple cider vinegar is a simple and really inexpensive remedy for low stomach acid. Personally, I\u2019ve found relief from minor heartburn by adding 1 teaspoon of vinegar to water and drinking.  Immune Support  ACV also has a long history of use for immune support. According to legend, thieves during the bubonic plague survived by making an herbal vinegar with herbs like rosemary, thyme and lavender.  The \u201cmother,\u201d which provides immune boosting properties on its own, also allows the vinegar to get stronger over time and maintain its beneficial properties.  Beautiful Hair  The beneficial acids in the \u201cmother\u201d of apple cider vinegar are also great for hair, and this is one reason that ACV is often recommended as a hair rinse for conditioning hair and increasing shine.  For Healthy Skin  Unrefined Apple Cider Vinegar is also often used in skin remedies and beauty recipes. It can be used to help sunburns, skin rashes and mosquito bites (I typically dilute 50:50 with water).  Blood Sugar Balance  Unrefined apple cider vinegar, high in beneficial compounds, is also known for its ability to help keep blood sugar in check. It isn\u2019t a wonder drug, but studies have shown that it can help lower blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity. (source)  Other studies have shown the benefits of ACV in helping improve cholesterol levels, and support heart health.  Where to buy Apple Cider Vinegar with the Mother  Most grocery stores should carry it, or you can purchase it online on as well.  Apple Cider Vinegar with The Mother: Bottom Line  Apple cider vinegar with the mother is simply unrefined, unpasteurized and unfiltered ACV. The \u201cmother\u201d is a colony of beneficial bacteria, similar to a Kombucha SCOBY, that helps create vinegar through a secondary fermentation process.  Vinegar is high in acetic acid and other beneficial compounds. Unfiltered apple cider vinegar may have more benefits that filtered and heated types of vinegar (though those types can work well for cleaning).  Does your vinegar have a mother?",

This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine\u2019s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We\u2019re in Stanley\u2019s on St Andrew\u2019s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It\u2019s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of \u201cLet\u2019s go out, but not to our usual place\u201d. I\u2019ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don\u2019t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley\u2019s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn\u2019t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we\u2019re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There\u2019s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  READ MORE  For the moment, it feels like we\u2019re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we\u2019ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley's is Morgan Vanderkamer. She's the sommelier here. But don't let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We\u2019re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is \u201camazing\u201d, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a \u20ac16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at \u20ac13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There\u2019s a small farmyard on that \u20ac16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the \u201cbacon and cabbage\u201d, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn\u2019t enough on the plate (there is), we\u2019ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas \u2013 but that\u2019s even better in my book \u2013 and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It\u2019s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There\u2019s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that\u2019s served deliciously chilly. It\u2019s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we\u2019ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that\u2019s what Stanley\u2019s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries and wine, came to \u20ac84.75.",

Every year, the actress packs her holiday gift guide with suggestions that are sure to raise eyebrows, from kinky lingerie and sex toys to genitalia grooming kits to drug paraphernalia \u2014 but for 2017 she's managed to outdo herself.  A section of the Goop gift guide for 'lovers,' in particular, really pushes the limits this year, recommending everything from sex toys \u2014 12, to be exact \u2014 to pricey lingerie to a pen that delivers THC to the body right before sex.  'Tis the season! Gwyneth Paltrow's website Goop has released its 2017 holiday gift guide  The gold standard in orgasms! In a section for 'lovers,' the site suggests five different vibrators, including two plated with precious metals  When tickling is out of touch: There's also this feather ring for 'tickling' in the bedroom, which costs a jaw-dropping $673  That's a pricey rub: Most of the section is packed with lingerie and sex toys, like this massage ring for $795  That price will certainly make a girl clench! A vocal promoter of vaginal maintenance, Gwyneth recommends $885 benwa balls, which are used to strengthen pelvic muscles  Naturally, the gift guide is full of items so pricey that the general public might be surprised that anyone would ever spend that much.  The 'lovers' section is no exception to the high price point, and includes a $425 silky PJ set, a $595 lace kimono, a $168 lace bra, and lots of expensive jewelry.  But the most shocking items don't have just big price tags to set them apart. This year, Goop is recommending five different vibrators, including the $99 Crave bullet with 24k gold plating, the $149 Crave Vesper vibrator necklace (also gold-plated), and a $169 Lelo Tiani 3.  Then there are the toys that don't buzz \u2014 but, despite a lack of mechanics, are still seriously expensive.  Suggested are the $673 Betony Vernon Marabou Pleasure Puff Ring, which 'works overtime as a playful tickler in the bedroom'.  The same brand has a double sterling-silver massage ring for $795, which looks like two simple metallic balls, as well as a set of $885 benwa balls, which women can carry around in their vaginas to strengthen pelvic muscles.  So kinky! She also suggests this BDSM-inspired piece of jewelry, which costs $1,505  Hurt me like my credit card statement! These leather tools for spanking and whipping cost hundreds of dollars  A true artist: This body-painting kit costs only $70 and comes with pain, disposable slippers, and a body scrubber for cleanup  For the budget fetishist: Less pricey are the pubic hair oil for $44 and $18 sexy bubble bath  There's also a 'Sado-Chic' piece of jewelry with a choker necklace and cuff bracelet, which are held together by a chain and clearly meant to be used in BDSM play. It costs $1,505.  Shoppers who want to shell out on leather goods for the bedroom have Gwyneth-approved options, too, including a $295 whip and a $195 paddle by Kiki de Montparnasse.  'Covered in supple textured lambskin leather, it makes for some utterly pleasurable chastising \u2014 light lashing, soft spanking \u2014 behind closed doors,' reads the Goop description of the paddle, which fails to mention that the human hand can do something quite similar and doesn't cost a thing.  And for those seeking a more experiential gift as opposed to something more materialistic, they need look no further than 'The Wild Woman's Way' tantra workshop \u2014 a steal at $450.  Luckily, there are a few budget-friendly options for Gwyneth's more cash-strapped but kinky admirers, though those are mostly of the bath and beauty variety. Try $44 'fur oil' for public hairs, $18 'Get it On' body wash by PLANT Apothecary, and a $70 Love is Art x goop 'couple's paint kit' for \u2014 ahem \u2014 sensual body-painting.  'The key to this body-painting kit \u2014 by which we mean painting a canvas using your and your partner\u2019s bodies \u2014 is stripping down first,' the website explains.'  Puff puff pump: The list includes these THC inhalers which come in varieties like 'passion' for using before sex  It's legal in Califonria! The list includes a joint storage case and a pipe  Super strength! This $199 Elvie Trainer is meant to help the user strengthen the pelvic floor.  Perhaps the most unique item, however, is the HMBLDT Passion Dose Pen for $40 and up. The pen delivers a THC-dominant formula to give a 'euphoric feeling' to 'increase sensuality and heighten your sexual experience'.  In fact, the 'lovers' category isn't the only one in which Goop recommends products related to cannabis or sex.  For 'dreamers,' the site offers a $45 JvdF 'joint case,' the right shape and size to git two marijuana joints \u2014 though Goop explains: 'It works great for storing any teeny essentials\u2014jewelry, Advil, you name it.'  There is also a ceramic pipe under the Stocking Stuffers category.  For 'health nuts,' there's a $199 Elvie Trainer, which is slipped into the vagina like a tampon and controlled via Bluetooth. It is meant to help the user strengthen the pelvic floor.  Of course, not everything on the list is rated PG-13 \u2014 but even the G-rated items can cost a few Gs.  Just expensive: The guide has a $130 match holder (left) and a $345 incense burner (right)  What does the fox say? (It says pricey!) For kids, this mask costs a whopping $52  Several of the gifts just seem extravagant for what they are, like a $125 bookmark (left) and a $181 diffuser (right)  Generous! This casserole dish will set a gift-giver back $1,220  Some of the most outrageous gifts for a host or hostess are a $100 RBT decanter, a $181 Addition Studio essential oil burner, and an $85 FS Objects bottle opener. Also on the list are bowls, vases, kettles, wine carriers, and candle holders, all for over $100 each.  Pricey gifts for a health nut include an $85 pouch of rocks (which Goop calls a 'medicine bag' of 'magically charged stones'), a $345 Cinnamon Projects x goop incense burner, and floss \u2014 what everyone wants for Christmas.  Her gifts for cooks have some of the steepest price tags, as they include a $1,220 casserole dish and a $755 sauce pan, both by Ondine, as well as $150 Graf trivet, a $425 Stories + Objects knife, and a $210 Pizzacraft pizza cooker.  The 'dreamer' category includes a $500 TRNTBL record player (there's that rock 'n roll), a $468 RSVP Paris leather portfolio, and a $125 (wh)ORE HA\u00fcS STUDIOS bookmark.  Pricey gifts for guys include a $185 Wood&Faulk camp stool, a $600 Shelter Co. tent, a $500 Fredericks & Mae dartboard, and a $228 Sherpapa diaper bag, while kids in her life can look forward to a $175 J.D.

The Insane Demands Kim Kardashian Gave Her Surrogate  Being pregnant is no easy task \u2013 especially if it's Kim Kardashian West's baby you're carrying. RadarOnline.com exclusively viewed the contract signed by Kardashian's surrogate \u2013 and it reveals an entire list of insanely bizarre demands Kardashian put in place that governed what the carrier of her baby could and could not do, wear and eat! As RadarOnline.com exclusively reported, Kim and her \"Famous\" rapper husband Kanye West paid their surrogate a mere $68K for carrying and delivering their baby girl.  Article continues below advertisement  On her app on Friday, Kardashian revealed her baby girl's name is Chicago West, sending fans into a social media frenzy over the wacky name. The agreement, signed by the surrogate and her husband in March 2017, included a long list of foods the surrogate had to refrain from eating. And hopefully the surrogate isn't a lover of cheese! According to the contract, the surrogate agreed to refrain from \"consuming, at any time, mold-ripened soft cheese, including, but not limited to, brie, camembert, chevre, blue cheese, and gorgonzola.\"  The surrogate's new Kardashian-inspired diet also meant \"raw or partially cooked eggs, raw or undercooked meat, cold deli meats, hot dogs, any and all live products (excluding yogurt), all pates, meat spreads, liver, supplements containing Vitamin A, raw peanuts, unpasteurized dairy and juices, raw sprouts and any unwashed fruits and vegetables\" were also off limits. The carrier of the newest Kardashian family member also agreed to not eat fish \u2013 and the Wests spelled out what types were and weren't allowed, even down to the portion size!  Article continues below advertisement  According to the document, \"consuming tile fish, raw shellfish, mackerel, raw fish, smoked salmon, or swordfish\" were not allowed \"at any time.\" However, the surrogate was allowed to eat tuna, but \"no more than six ounces\" per week! The contract begs the question whether or not Kardashian followed these rules when she was pregnant with her other two children, North, 4, and Saint, 2. In addition to food, the surrogate was ordered to not drink \"more than one cup of a caffeinated beverage per day.\"  Also in the agreement are a strict set of rules pertaining to the surrogate's wellness and beauty regimen. The KKW Beauty founder specified that \"hot tubs or saunas\" were not allowed. The gestational carrier also signed off on steering clear from \"ingesting medical herbs, exposure to essential oils and aromatherapy, and prolonged exposure to chemical cleansers, hair spray, pesticides, and paint fumes.\"  Article continues below advertisement  Luckily, massages were allowed \u2013 but only if the surrogate used a special oil. \"It shall only be with sweet almond oil which the treating physician has approved for her to have contact with during the pregnancy,\" the agreement states. The surrogate was also instructed to only receive manicure and pedicures with a protective mask. Additionally, the surrogate was unable to undergo chemical teeth whitening or go to the tanning salon, the documents state.  Chicago's carrier also agreed to avoid the use of certain medicines spelled out for her in the contract, including \"Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil and Naproxen.\" An insider close to the surrogate admitted that although the agreement featured countless over-the-top requests, the surrogate was still ecstatic to find out she'd be carrying a soon-to-be very famous newborn. \"She's watched every episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" the insider revealed, adding meeting the couple for the first time \"was a surreal moment.\"  What do you think of Kimye's over-the-top demands?

The 39-year-old reality star is known for her organic, mostly natural diet, and just because summer is approaching, doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s slacking off. This week, the \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d star took to her website and app to reveal the healthy-yet-delicious meals she\u2019s eating on her summer meal plan.  Though she hasn\u2019t revealed her full week of meals, we have the scoop on what she eats on the first two days, and if you\u2019re a fan of keeping cool this summer, Kourt\u2019s meals might be for you.

The teriyaki sauce consists of one cup of water, five tablespoons of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, one to two tablespoons of honey, one large finely minced clove of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, and 1/4 cup of cold water. For the dipping sauce, Kourtney combines two tablespoons of Vegenaise and a tablespoons of Sriracha.  Instructions:  For Sandwich:  1. Slice the tofu in half and wrap it in a paper towel. Place it on a plate and weigh it down with something heavy (like a pan). Once the paper towel becomes wet, change it for a new one. Repeat a few times until the paper towel stays almost dry.  2. Combine the teriyaki sauce ingredients and mix until well combined. Set aside.  3. Set the oven to 390\u00b0F and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Coat tofu in teriyaki sauce. Brush a bit of oil on the parchment paper underneath the tofu and bake for about 30 minutes (until crisp and dry), flipping the pieces to the other side halfway through.  4. Place your nori sheet down in the center of your workspace. Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice. Place it in the middle of the sheet and form it into a compacted square.  5. Put a layer of tofu, cucumber, avocado and spinach on the rice and cover all the ingredients with another layer of compacted rice.  6. Seal all 4 corners of the nori sheet on the top of the filling (like an envelope).  7. Cut in half with a sharp knife and enjoy!  For Dipping Sauce: Mix Vegenaise and Sriracha until smooth.",

Rachel Weisz is an English actress and model who has a net worth of $40 million. Weisz is one of the most celebrated actresses of the modern era, having won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, and a British Academy Film Award. After beginning her career with theatre and television roles, Rachel eventually gravitated towards film and started to make a name for herself. Today, she is probably best known for her breakthrough role in \"The Mummy\" and \"The Mummy Returns.\"  That said, she has continued her career with a number of notable roles in films like \"Enemy at the Gates\" and \"The Lovely Bones,\" and she won an Academy Award for her role in 2005's \"The Constant Gardener.\" While Weisz is a regular fixture in major motion pictures, she also branches out considerably into well-received independent films. These include \"The Deep Blue Sea\" and \"The Favourite.\" She also maintains a considerable presence in the world of theatre.  Early Life  Rachel Hannah Weisz was born on March 7th of 1970 in Westminster, London. Raised in a Jewish household in the London suburb of Hampstead Garden alongside a younger sister, Rachel was encouraged to pursue the arts at a young age. At the age of 14, the exceptionally beautiful Weisz started modeling. During this period, she also started to venture into the acting world.  After graduating from secondary school, Rachel studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. During her university days, Weisz performed in various school plays and eventually graduated with upper second-class honors.  Career  Rachel began her acting career with primarily television work in various British series and stage work. She also appeared in television films during this early period. By 1994, she had booked her first movie role in \"Death Machine,\" although she played a minor part. That year, she also broke through with a stage production of \"Design for Living.\" She then followed up with roles in movies like \"Chain Reaction\" and \"Stealing Beauty,\" the latter of which earned her the reputation of being a so-called \"English Rose.\"  After a few more film roles, Rachel truly broke through with a central role in the film \"The Mummy.\" The 1999 movie proved to be quite successful, raking in over $416 million on a budget of $80 million. However, critics weren't very kind to the acting performances, which they referred to as \"buffoonery.\" In 2001, Weisz reprised her role in \"The Mummy Returns,\" which was even more financially successful than the original film. It raked in $435 million in total on a budget of just under $100 million, but once again failed to impress critics.  This was the beginning of Rachel's time in the spotlight, and she followed up with roles in major films like \"Beautiful Creatures,\" \"Enemy at the Gates,\" \"About a Boy,\" \"The Runaway Jury,\" and \"The Shape of Things.\" After a few more major film appearances, Rachel made a huge impact with her performance in \"The Constant Gardener.\" The performance won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2006. That year, she also appeared in \"The Fountain.\" In 2009, she received widespread acclaim for her appearance in the theatre revival of \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\"  From the 2010s onward, Weisz started to venture more towards independent films and stage work. Her films of this period include \"The Whistleblower\" and \"The Deep Blue Sea.\" That being said, Rachel also found time to appear in major films like \"The Bourne Legacy.\" From the middle of the decade, her most notable films were independent productions like \"The Lobster\" and \"The Favourite.\" The latter performance earned her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and she was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  Towards the end of the 2010s, Weisz started her own production company called LC6 Productions. The company released the film \"Disobedience\" in 2017. In 2019, she was strongly linked to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and she was rumored to have a role in the film \"Black Widow.\" In 2021, it was confirmed that she had booked the role of Iron Maiden in the movie.  Relationships  Rachel Weisz was once engaged to filmmaker Darren Aronofsky after the pair started dating in 2012. Aronofsky and Weisz had a son together in 2006 but ultimately went their separate ways in 2010. Not long afterward, Rachel began dating her longtime friend and fellow actor Daniel Craig. In 2011, they were married, and they subsequently had one child together. That year, Weisz also became a naturalized US citizen, giving her dual British-American citizenship.  Real Estate  In 2018, it was widely reported that Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig had purchased a home in Brooklyn. Apparently, they paid $6.75 million for the house in Cobble Hill. Despite being partially burned in 2016, the 6,600-square-foot property was repaired long before Weisz and her husband purchased it. It features six bedrooms, 14-foot ceilings, and an elevator. Prior to this purchase, the couple was widely rumored to have lived in a multi-million property in Soho.  In 2019, it was reported that Craig and Weisz had sold a property in East Village for $6 million. This was the exact same price they originally paid for the residence in 2012, which represents a net loss when you consider the various fees associated with a real estate transaction. The condo spans 3,200 square feet and features three bedrooms.",

        "doc_1_text": "(1964-)  Who Is Hoda Kotb?  Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot. Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show's opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, marking the first time two female hosts were paired together in Today's history.  'Today' Co-Host  On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC\u2019s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie.  Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today\u2019s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent.  'Dateline' to Kathie Lee Cohort  Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008.  Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010. After Gifford left Today in April 2019, Kotb was joined by Jenna Bush Hager for the show's fourth hour.  Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing  Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who \"wanted us to be red, white and blue.\" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt.  After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986.  Early Career  Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998.  Breast Cancer Survivor  Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram.  Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word \"forward\" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.  After coming across a breast cancer walk in Central Park later that year, Kotb decided to go public with her story. Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Awards and Other Endeavors  In 2007, Kotb was part of the Dateline team honored with a prestigious Peabody Award for The Education of Ms. Groves, a documentary chronicling the challenges facing a first-year teacher at an urban middle school in Atlanta, Georgia. She is also a recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and four Gracie Awards, and has been nominated for numerous Emmys.  Along with her celebrated broadcasting work, Kotb in 2010 published her memoir, Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee. She has since written two more books, Ten Years Later: Six People Who Faced Adversity and Transformed Their Lives (2013) and Where They Belong: The Best Decisions That People Almost Never Made (2016).  The TV personality has also pulled double duty as a radio host since launching The Hoda Show on SiriusXM in February 2015.  Romantic Partners and Children  In 2005, Kotb married Burzis Kanga, the former tennis coach for the University of New Orleans, but they divorced two years later.  In 2013, the TV personality began dating financier Joel Schiffman. Unable to have children after her treatments for cancer, she adopted daughter Haley Joy in February 2017, introducing the 12-week-old to Today fans that Mother\u2019s Day. In April 2019, Kotb adopted another girl, named Hope Catherine.  That November, Kotb announced her engagement to Schiffman. In January 2022, Kotb announced that they had broken up.

        "doc_1_text": "(1964-)  Who Is Hoda Kotb?  Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot. Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show's opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, marking the first time two female hosts were paired together in Today's history.  'Today' Co-Host  On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC\u2019s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie.  Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today\u2019s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent.  'Dateline' to Kathie Lee Cohort  Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008.  Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010. After Gifford left Today in April 2019, Kotb was joined by Jenna Bush Hager for the show's fourth hour.  Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing  Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who \"wanted us to be red, white and blue.\" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt.  After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986.  Early Career  Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998.  Breast Cancer Survivor  Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram.  Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word \"forward\" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.  After coming across a breast cancer walk in Central Park later that year, Kotb decided to go public with her story. Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Awards and Other Endeavors  In 2007, Kotb was part of the Dateline team honored with a prestigious Peabody Award for The Education of Ms. Groves, a documentary chronicling the challenges facing a first-year teacher at an urban middle school in Atlanta, Georgia. She is also a recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and four Gracie Awards, and has been nominated for numerous Emmys.  Along with her celebrated broadcasting work, Kotb in 2010 published her memoir, Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee. She has since written two more books, Ten Years Later: Six People Who Faced Adversity and Transformed Their Lives (2013) and Where They Belong: The Best Decisions That People Almost Never Made (2016).  The TV personality has also pulled double duty as a radio host since launching The Hoda Show on SiriusXM in February 2015.  Romantic Partners and Children  In 2005, Kotb married Burzis Kanga, the former tennis coach for the University of New Orleans, but they divorced two years later.  In 2013, the TV personality began dating financier Joel Schiffman. Unable to have children after her treatments for cancer, she adopted daughter Haley Joy in February 2017, introducing the 12-week-old to Today fans that Mother\u2019s Day. In April 2019, Kotb adopted another girl, named Hope Catherine.  That November, Kotb announced her engagement to Schiffman. In January 2022, Kotb announced that they had broken up.

Born on February 19, 2004, Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress. Her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she began earning parts on shows like Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and NCIS. Her big break came with the 2016 debut of the Netflix sleeper hit Stranger Things, on which she stars as the gifted Eleven.  Early Life & Career  Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress who was born on February 19, 2004. Her family moved back to the U.K. when Brown was four years old and then moved to Orlando, Florida, four years later to start an entrepreneurial business. It was there that she was spotted by a talent scout who told her parents \"she has instincts you cannot teach.\"  Brown's parents sacrificed everything \u2014 moving their family to Los Angeles \u2014 to see Brown's acting dreams come true.  TV and Film Roles  'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,' 'Intruders'  Within three months of moving, Brown was given the role of Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, and soon after she appeared as Madison O'Donnell in BBC America's Intruders. While Brown continued finding work in smaller roles on shows like NCIS, Modern Family and Grey\u2019s Anatomy, she kept getting passed up for bigger roles.  With no major jump in her career, her family had become so financially strained, they moved back to the U.K. to live with an aunt. \"I was devastated. I wasn\u2019t getting work. I thought I was done,\" said Brown in an interview with the Daily Mail.  'Stranger Things'  However, as things were looking bleak, Brown landed an audition for Netflix's Stranger Things. \"I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park,\" she said. Weeks later, Brown was on a plane to begin filming in Atlanta.  Set in a 1980s Indiana town facing a threat from paranormal activity, Stranger Things became a hit upon its release in 2016, earning an array of awards. Meanwhile, Brown was heralded as one of its breakout performers for her role of Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers.  The show's success was such that its primary actors all scored big raises heading into the July 2019 release of season 3, with Brown rumored to be earning as much as its best-known star, Winona Ryder. That September, it was revealed that season 4 of the series was in the works.  Actress Millie Bobby Brown attends the premiere of Netflix\u2019s \u2019Stranger Things\u2019 at Mack Sennett Studios on July 11, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.

She was then set to reprise her role of Madison Russell in 2020's Godzilla vs. Kong.  Personal  In late 2017, rumors began swirling that Brown was dating Jacob Sartorius, an American singer who launched his career through popular clips posted to Musical.ly. The young couple confirmed their relationship with sweet messages addressed to one another via Instagram on Valentine's Day 2018 but broke up a few months later in July 2018.  In April 2018, the 14-year-old Brown was the youngest person named to Time's 100 most influential list. Writing about her inclusion among the special group, actor Aaron Paul recalled how he was stunned by Brown's wisdom and perspective upon meeting her, feeling like he was talking to a future leader. \"Maybe that's why she's such an extraordinary actor,\" he wrote. \"She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.\"  Meanwhile, the unfortunate meme #takedownmilliebobbybrown was gaining steam on social media. Beginning with a user who accused Brown of pulling off her hijab and stamping on it, the thread took on a life of its own as people relayed exaggerated stories of the actress attacking them while delivering expletive-filled homophobic comments. Brown ultimately deactivated her Twitter account in June 2018.

Kristen Bell is an American actress, dancer, singer, and film producer who has a net worth of $40 million. That is a combined net worth with her husband since 2013, actor/podcaster Dax Shepard. Kristen Bell is one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood, and she has amassed an impressive list of credits over the course of her career. She and Dax appear in many commercials together and they co-founded a baby product company called Hello Bello, which unfortunately filed for bankruptcy in October 2023.  Early Life  Kristen Anne Bell was born on July 18th of 1980 in a Detroit suburb. Her family was somewhat involved in the entertainment industry, as her father worked as a television news director in Las Vegas. Her mother was a nurse. When Bell was just two years old, her parents split up. Because both of her parents remarried, she has a number of half-siblings.  Bell attended a private school instead of a public high school, and she graduated from Shrine Catholic School in 1998. Kristen Bell fell in love with drama and acting during her time at this private school, and she took part in a number of its theater productions \u2013 often taking the lead role. Her passion for theater led her to New York upon graduation, where she attended the Tisch School of Arts at New York University and majored in musical theater.  Career  Kristen Bell never had a chance to graduate from New York University, because she was offered the opportunity of a lifetime during her senior year. She was cast in the Broadway production of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and her acting career began with a bang. She had been auditioning since the age of 13, but her Broadway role seems to have kickstarted her career. Soon thereafter, she won a role in the movie Pootie Tang. After appearing in one more Broadway production, she moved to Los Angeles and won a number of guest roles in various television shows. Although Kristen Bell was booking, she had trouble finding a recurring role early in her career.  Kristen Bell won widespread fame after appearing in the film Spartan alongside Val Kilmer, playing the president's kidnapped daughter. That year would prove to be a major turning point in Bell's career, as she finally booked the recurring role she'd been looking for when Veronica Mars launched in 2004. Critics were quick to praise Bell's performance, and she soon booked more film roles as a result of her increased fame.  Although Veronica Mars was eventually canceled, Kristen Bell was able to make the transition to other roles fairly easily \u2013 both on television and in film. Her first major role on Veronica Mars was on Heroes, a series that she had expressed admiration for in the past. She also won a role as the narrator for Gossip Girl, eventually appearing in person during the final episode. During this period, she also starred in the films Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Fanboys.  She also became involved in the video game industry, voice acting and performing motion-capture for various games in the Assassin's Creed series. She earned voice acting credits once again when she worked on Astro Boy. Additional roles during this time include those in Scream 4 and Burlesque. In 2013, she landed what was perhaps her biggest-ever voice acting role in the hit film Frozen.  Voice acting roles continued to come Bell's way, and she also played the Sloth in the animated film Zootopia. Further voice acting roles include those in Ralph Breaks the Internet and Frozen II. Although voice acting seems to have become a focus for Bell in the later stages of her career, she continues to take on traditional acting roles as well. The fourth season of Veronica Mars was given the green light in 2018, with Kristen Bell once again playing the lead. She also appeared in the comedy CHiPs.  Personal Life  Although she had been in a relationship with Kevin Mann since 2002, Kristen Bell ended this relationship. The couple had been engaged for a number of years prior to their breakup. That same year, Kristen Bell began a romantic relationship with Dax Shepard, a fellow actor who was also from the Detroit area. The couple went on to star alongside each other in a number of films, including CHiPs, When In Rome, and Hit and Run. Although they became engaged in 2010, it wasn't until 2013 that they were finally wed. The couple has two daughters together.  Kristen Bell is a dedicated vegan and had previously been a vegetarian since the age of 11. She and her husband both switched to being vegan after watching a documentary, and Bell is very active in the animal rights community. She has a number of pets and supports a number of animal welfare organizations.  Hello Bello  In addition to acting, Kristen Bell has also become involved in a number of entrepreneurial ventures. In line with her vegan lifestyle, in 2019 she and Dax founded a plant-based line of baby care products called Hello Bello. They soon landed a deal to exclusively distribute their products at Walmart. Unfortunately in October 2023 Hello Bello filed for bankruptcy, listing $100 million in liabilities, of which $22 million was owed to a single creditor, a paper supplier.  Real Estate  Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are also real estate investors. They own at least two residential apartment buildings in Los Angeles. The couple made headlines during the 2020 Coronavirus crisis after publicly refusing to accept rent checks during the month of April, giving their tenants a period of financial relief during economically demanding times. Dax's sister manages the buildings.  As for their own private real estate investments, in August 2017 Kristen and Dax paid $4.3 million for a 4,400 square foot home in Los Angeles' Los Feliz neighborhood.

        "doc_2_text": "First, ex-Mouseketeer Britney Spears posed in short shorts and a black bra on a Rolling Stone cover in 1999. Then, a scantily clad onetime Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus, twerked up a storm at the MTV VMAs two years ago. Now, it\u2019s former Disney star Selena Gomez, 23, who\u2019s shed most of her clothing as part of an attempt to establish herself as a grown-up artist.  All eyes are on her new album, \u201cRevival\u201d (her first for Interscope), out Friday \u2014 or, more accurately, all eyes are on her album cover. It\u2019s got Gomez practically in her birthday suit, topless and wearing only barely there shorts.  Like Disney alumni who have gone before, she\u2019s looking to shake things up with a new look and sound that are a world away from her previous, wholesome persona. The lyrics from the opening title track explain it plainly, as Gomez sings, \u201cNo more hiding . . . it\u2019s my time to butterfly.\u201d  It hasn\u2019t been the easiest journey from child star known for kid shows such as \u201cBarney & Friends\u201d and \u201cWizards of Waverly Place\u201d to full-blown adult celebrity. After canceling an Australian tour to support her debut solo album, \u201cStars Dance,\u201d at the end of 2013, Gomez voluntarily entered Dawn at the Meadows recovery and rehab center in Arizona at the start of 2014. Rumors of substance abuse and addiction swirled \u2014 maybe brought on by her consorting with Justin Bieber (another onetime child star with his own set of troubles). But Gomez set the record straight this week, telling Billboard it was actually so she could get chemotherapy for lupus.  She returned later in the year with the single \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants,\u201d an obvious referral to her on-off relationship with Bieber, and her final release for Disney\u2019s Hollywood Records.  But Gomez turned over a new leaf this summer with the sultry, R&B-flavored single \u201cGood for You,\u201d featuring A$AP Rocky.  \u201cWe definitely felt that the sexier sound of that song was a good progression for Selena,\u201d says Sharon Dastur, senior vice president of programming integration at iHeartMedia. \u201cAs you grow up, you want to try different things. It\u2019s not just a thing for ex-Disney artists \u2014 all young people feel that way.\u201d  Another sign of a maturing Gomez: She fired her mother, Mandy Teefey, and stepfather, Brian, as her managers. That, notes veteran Nashville-based entertainment lawyer Stephen Weaver, is a positive career move.  Manager-parents can cause problems for record labels. Weaver recalls pitching an artist with a father-manager to a powerful producer. \u201c[He\u2019d] had so many bad experiences with parents as managers that he refused to listen to it. He was afraid he would like it!\u201d  Although Gomez is following a tradition of other young stars transitioning to adulthood, her \u201cRevival\u201d cover photo is about more than hitting the world over the head with sexuality. Gomez recently explained that it was a kiss-off to the body-shamers who have savaged her bikini body in the past online. \u201cI did start gaining weight, and I didn\u2019t mind it,\u201d she told the Los Angeles radio station Power 106 last month. \u201c[The comments were] really hurtful . . . but I\u2019m not gonna give a f \u2013 \u2013 k what people say.

        "generated_text": "In the world of celebrity, the transition from child star to adult artist is a common phenomenon. Disney alumni such as Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez have all made this transition, shaking things up with new looks and sounds that are a departure from their previous wholesome personas. Gomez, who was known for her role in Disney's \"Wizards of Waverly Place,\" recently posed nude on the cover of Rolling Stone, showing off her new, more mature image. The lyrics of her upcoming album, \"Revival,\" suggest that she is ready to leave her Disney days behind.\n\nGomez has not always had an easy journey to becoming a full-blown adult celebrity. After canceling an Australian tour to support her debut solo album, \"Stars Dance,\" at the end of 2013, she voluntarily entered a rehabilitation center in Arizona at the start of 2014. Rumors of substance abuse and addiction swirled, but Gomez clarified this week that she was actually there to receive chemotherapy for lupus.\n\nGomez returned later in the year with the single \"The Heart Wants What It Wants,\" an obvious reference to her on-off relationship with Justin Bieber. She then released the sultry, R&B-flavored single \"Good for You,\" featuring A$AP Rocky. With these new releases, Gomez seems to be following in the footsteps of other young stars who transition to adulthood.\n\nAnother sign of Gomez's maturation is that she recently fired her mother and stepfather as her managers. According to a Nashville-based entertainment lawyer, manager-parents can cause problems for record labels, and it is often better for young artists to have professional managers.\n\nKristen Bell, another American actress, dancer, singer, and film producer, is also worth noting. With a net worth of $40 million, Bell is one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood. She has amassed an impressive list of credits over the course of her career, including roles in Broadway productions, films, and video games. She also co-founded a baby product company called Hello Bello, which unfortunately filed for bankruptcy in October 2023.",

An injury ended his college football career, so he entered the ring with the WWE. As \"The Rock,\" he famously feuded with wrestler Steve Austin and won the WWE Heavyweight title numerous times. Johnson then parlayed his wrestling fame into a film career, appearing in projects like 2001's The Mummy Returns and 2010's Tooth Fairy. Later projects include the HBO series Ballers and leading roles in The Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises and the voice as demigod Maui in Moana.  READ MORE: 10 Things You May Not Know About Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson  Early Life and Career  Johnson was born on May 2, 1972, in Hayward, California. The grandson of professional wrestler Peter \"High Chief\" Fanene Maivia and son of wrestler Rocky Johnson, the young Johnson grew up watching his father perform in the ring. With no plans to follow in his footsteps, Johnson played college football at the University of Miami, showing promise with his size and athleticism until being slowed by injuries.  Becoming 'The Rock'  With few prospects in professional football, Johnson turned to wrestling, debuting in the WWE against the Brooklyn Brawler in Texas. After a couple more matches, including a tag team win with Bart Sawyer, the WWE signed him under the name Flex Kavana. A year later, he joined The Nation of Domination, eventually taking over its leadership and calling himself The Rock.  He later joined another band of elite wrestlers known as The Corporation and began a notorious feud with Steve Austin. Also known as \"The People's Champ,\" The Rock went on to win a combined 17 WWE titles over his acclaimed career.  Movies and TV  'Scorpion King'  Outside the wrestling ring, The Rock launched a successful acting career, dropping the stage name and simply going by Dwayne Johnson. He first made a big splash as the Scorpion King, a supernatural bad guy, in 2001's The Mummy Returns. Johnson returned to this role the following year for The Scorpion King. Trying his hand at comedy, he appeared in 2005's Be Cool with John Travolta and Uma Thurman and 2007's The Game Plan.  'Driver,' 'Fast & Furious' Franchise  Johnson's acting career to continued to thrive through his appearances in such films as Driver (2010) and Fast & Furious 6 (2013). In 2014, he starred as the titular strong man in Hercules. Johnson also returned to wrestling from time to time, including a 2014 appearance with Hulk Hogan and Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania 30.  HBO's 'Ballers'  In 2015, Johnson dominated the big screen with two big action films. He appeared in Furious Seven and starred in San Andreas. Johnson also debuted his first dramatic comedy series that same year, playing Spencer Strasmore, a retired pro footballer turned financial planner, on Ballers.  'Central Intelligence,' 'Moana,' 'Baywatch,' 'Jumanji'  In 2016, after teaming up with Kevin Hart for the action-comedy Central Intelligence, Johnson voiced the demigod Maui for the Disney animated hit Moana. He was a busy man in 2017, taking on starring roles in The Fate of the Furious, a big-screen adaptation of the 1990s lifeguard series Baywatch and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.  'Skyscraper,' 'Rampage,' 'Hobbs & Shaw'  The good vibes continued into 2018, with Jumanji racking up the ticket sales en route to becoming the actor's highest-grossing film to date. He also managed to stand out during the blitz of advertising accompanying the Super Bowl in February, debuting a trailer for the movie Skyscraper, in which he partakes in death-defying stunts with a prosthetic leg.  That same day, Johnson announced he would be hosting a 10-episode unscripted competition show, The Titan Games, to \"create a platform that gave everyday people the opportunity to change their lives and do something extraordinary.\"  Next up for the action star was Rampage, based on the popular 1980s arcade game, which hit theaters a few months before the July release of Skyscraper.  Johnson returned to his wrestling roots by appearing as himself in Fighting with My Family (2019), based on the true story of female wrestling champion Saraya \"Paige\" Bevis. Later that year, he was back in action mode with the Fast & Furious spinoff Hobbs & Shaw, alongside Jason Statham.  'Young Rock'  In 2021, Young Rock, a television series about the life of Johson, premiered. The show stars Johnson and other actors playing younger versions of the actor.  XFL Co-Owner  In August 2020, Johnson announced that he teamed up with his wife and a sports management company to buy the XFL, which went bankrupt earlier in the year, for $15 million. \"The acquisition of the XFL with my talented partners, Dany Garcia and Gerry Cardinale, is an investment for me that's rooted deeply in two things\u2014my passion for the game and my desire to always take care of the fans,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"With pride and gratitude for all that I've built with my own two hands, I plan to apply these callouses to the XFL, and look forward to creating something special for the players, fans, and everyone involved for the love of football.\"  Personal Life  In August 2019, Johnson tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend, singer/music producer Lauren Hashian. The two are parents to daughters Jasmine Lia (b. December 2015) and Tiana Gia (b. April 2018).  Johnson also has a daughter, Simone Alexandra, from his first marriage. He and his high school sweetheart, Dany Garcia, wed in 1997 and split up a decade later, though she continues to serve as his manager.

        "doc_2_text": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez\u2019s New York romance is still young but the singer and the slugger both have lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.  Who has the more impressive dating history?  Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez have been dating for about four months.  Jennifer Lopez  David Cruz (1984-1994): The couple began dating when the singer was just a teenager, but split after a decade together.  Wesley Snipes (1994-1995): The \u201cMoney Train\u201d co-stars were briefly linked after meeting on set, during which Lopez filmed her first sex scene.  Ojani Noa (1997-1998): Lopez wed the Miami waiter in 1997, but the marriage lasted less than a year. Noa tried to sell a book about their relationship but Lopez sued and the manuscript was shut down. She walked away with $545,000 in compensatory damages too. In 2011, she also had to block the release of a private, intimate video that reportedly included 15 to 20 minutes of nudity from their 1997 honeymoon.  Lopez and Sean Combs were linked in 1999 before he was arrested in relation to a Manhattan night club shooting.  Sean Combs (1999): Pre-Diddy, Sean Combs began dating Lopez while she was working on her first album. But the rapper turned out to be too much of a bad boy, and they split soon after he was arrested in relation to a Manhattan night club shooting in December 1999 and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Lopez was also charged in the incident but the charges were dropped soon after.  Cris Judd (2000-2002): The former backup dancer was hired to direct Lopez\u2019s \u201cLove Don\u2019t Cost a Thing\u201d in late 2000 and the couple were married by September 2001. They split less than a year later, but didn\u2019t finalize their divorce until 2003.  Ben Affleck (2002-2004): Bennifer began in 2002 when they filmed \u201cGigli\u201d together and peaked with a $1.2 million, 6.1-carat pink diamond ring. Hollywood\u2019s favorite couple heartbreakingly called it quits in early 2004, just before their wedding date.  Marc Anthony (2004-2011): Anthony and Lopez had twins together during their seven-year marriage \u2014 which started just days after his divorce to Dayanara Torres was finalized. The salsa artist planted a kiss on Lopez at the Latin Grammys in November, but that wasn\u2019t enough to rekindle the romance.  Casper Smart (2011-2016): A five-year on-and-off romance with the much younger dancer ended when Lopez reportedly caught Smart cheating.  The singer and Canadian rapper Drake were linked for a whirlwind two months.  Drake (2016): The whirlwind romance that started with a cozy Instagram photo was over within two months.  Alex Rodriguez  Rodriguez was married to Cynthia Scurtis for six years. The couple has two daughters.  Cynthia Scurtis (2002-2008): A-Rod\u2019s six-year marriage to Scurtis resulted in two daughters \u2014 Natasha and Ella \u2014 and ended in an ugly alimony battle.  Madonna (2008): The Material Girl claimed they were just friends, but Rodriguez\u2019s wife blamed Madonna for their divorce. The third baseman was reportedly making late-night visits to Madonna\u2019s upper West Side home just weeks after his wife gave birth to their second child.  Bethenny Frankel (2009): The Yankees slugger spent time with the \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star in early 2009, but the hook-up was shortlived.  Kate Hudson (2009): Hudson was a regular guest at Yankee Stadium when the two were linked during the Bronx Bombers\u2019 World Series season.  The Yankees slugger was frequently spotted around town with Cameron Diaz during their romance.  Cameron Diaz (2010-2011): One of A-Rod\u2019s more public flings, he and Diaz were spotted out together frequently, most famously when she fed him popcorn at Super Bowl XLV.  Torrie Wilson (2011-2015): The WWE star stuck by Rodriguez for more than three years, including during his MLB suspension in 2014.  Demi Moore (2012): A-Rod and Moore were spotted on a dinner date in the West Village in July 2012 in what was considered a best friend faux pas; Madonna and Moore were longtime friends.  A-Rod dated Silicon Valley tycoon Wojcicki for almost a year.  Anne Wojcicki (2016-2017): The Silicon Valley tycoon settled for the retired slugger for almost a year before the two split. They made their public debut at the Met Gala in May.",

He was also well known for playing Johnny \"Viper\" Vennaro in the 1994 children's comedy film Little Giants. After spending several years as a musician, Steuer entered the culinary industry and owned his own restaurant in Portland, Oregon.  Life and career [ edit ]  Acting [ edit ]  Steuer was three years old and living in San Diego, California, when he began asking his mother, a former member of the United States Ski Team, about becoming an actor. Within a year, he was attending children's modeling shows at local shopping malls. His break came when another did not appear for one of these shows; Steuer leapt onto the stage and offered his services. A talent agent, impressed with the boy's hubris and performance, approached him and his mother afterward and offered to represent Steuer and obtain acting roles for him.[1]  Within a year, Steuer had received a minor guest-starring role on the television series Day by Day. In 1990, Steuer was cast as Alexander Rozhenko in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Reunion\". Although a number of young children auditioned for the role, Steuer was the only child able to sit still for the three hours it took for the make-up department to cast his Klingon facial prosthetics. The ability to be still for a long period of time won him the part. The producers of the series sought him out a year later to reprise the role. However, Steuer had only grown half an inch in height and, at six years old, did not have a deep enough voice. So the producers cast actor Brian Bonsall, who was more than two years older, as Alexander. Steuer later said he was very upset at the part being recast.[1]  Steuer performed several more times over the next three years, including the 1991 comedy Late for Dinner, a guest shot in the episode \"Unpacking\" of the TV series The Wonder Years, and a role in the made-for-television movie When Love Kills: The Seduction of John Hearn (1993). In the fall of 1993, Steuer won the role of Quentin Kelly in the television series Grace Under Fire.[a] But the extensive press attention given to lead actress Brett Butler, due to her erratic behavior and substance abuse, and Butler's sexual misconduct (she lifted her skirt and flashed her breasts in front of Steuer), led him to quit the show.[3] Although he auditioned for TV and movie roles after leaving Grace Under Fire, producers and press kept asking him about Butler and what it was like to work with her. Unwilling to continue to submit to such intense scrutiny, Steuer quit acting. He told an interviewer for The A.V. Club in 2015: \"I wanted to forge on with acting after quitting the show, and I went out on a few interviews. But even then they'd turn into question-and-answer sessions with casting agents about Grace Under Fire. I was kind of blown away by how unprofessional people inside the industry were. It really soured me. I didn't want that kind of attention.\"[1]  During his time on Grace Under Fire, Steuer was cast in the 1994 comedy film Little Giants. He co-starred alongside 13-year-old Sam Horrigan. Horrigan replaced Steuer in the role of Quentin Kelly after Steuer left Grace Under Fire.[4]  Career after acting [ edit ]  Steuer eventually moved to Denver, Colorado. In 2003,[5] he and several other local musicians formed the glam punk band Kill City Thrillers. Steuer performed as lead singer for the band under the name Jonny P. Jewels. Within a few months, the band changed its name to Soda Pop Kids, and about 2005[6] the band and most of its members moved to Portland, Oregon.

He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises,\u201d said Cooper.

        "doc_2_text": "Jonathan Demme, the Oscar-winning director of The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, Rachel Getting Married, and much more, died Wednesday at age of 73.  Demme\u2019s varied career not only covered feature films; he was an accomplished director of concert films and documentaries as well, working with an equally diverse array of talent, from Oprah Winfrey and Laura Dern to Justin Timberlake and Spalding Gray.  As news of the filmmaker\u2019s death continues to spread, celebrities and influencers within the entertainment industry have begun sharing their reactions on social media. See a selection of remembrances below.  \u201cA big hearted, big tent, compassionate man- in full embrace in his life of people in need- and of the potential of art, music, poetry and film to fill that need- a big loss to the caring world.\u201d \u2014 Meryl Streep  \u201cJonathan taught us how big a heart a person can have, and how it will guide how we live and what we do for a living. He was the grandest of men.\u201d \u2014 Tom Hanks  \u201cI am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you\u2019d have to design a hurricane to contain him. Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much.\u201d \u2014 Jodie Foster  \u201cI am really shocked and very sad to hear about Jonathan\u2019s passing. He was one of the best, and a really nice guy as well who had such a great spirit. My condolences to his family.\u201d \u2014 Anthony Hopkins  \u201cJonathan Demme came into my life when he directed me in Melvin and Howard. I won an Oscar for that role and I can\u2019t imagine that having happened with any other director. He was pure magic. Brilliant technically but he never let that make him isolated. He included everyone on that set in the making of the movie in the most edgy, thrilling, wildly collaborative way. He did the same thing in Philadelphia. And, there, we never forgot for a moment that that film could change the experience of being HIV positive in this country and it did. The heartbeat and the integrity of it began with Jonathan\u2019s goodness and sense of justice. I\u2019m so proud to have been in it.  I think the last public appearance he may have made was to host the NYC screening of my son, Charlie McDowell\u2019s film, The Discovery. It can\u2019t have been easy for him to go to NYC from Nyack and do that a couple of weeks before his death. But Jonathan celebrated and honored creativity more fiercely than anyone I have ever known. My daughter worked with him in The Manchurian Candidate. We all admired him so much. I send all of our family\u2019s love to his beautiful family and I will hold him where he\u2019s always been, in my heart, forever.\u201d \u2014 Mary Steenburgen  \u201cWhenever I ran into Jonathan, he was filled with enthusiasm and excitement about a new project. He took so much joy in moviemaking. His pictures have an inner lyricism that just lifts them off the ground \u2014 even a story like The Silence of the Lambs. I have great admiration for Jonathan as a filmmaker \u2014 I love the freshness of his style and his excellent use of music, from Buddy Holly to Miklos Rozsa. There\u2019s so much more to be said, and I hardly know where to begin. I also loved him as a friend, and to me he was always young. My young friend. The idea that he\u2019s gone seems impossible to me.\u201d \u2014 Martin Scorsese",

A lawsuit has been filed against Hollywood producer Joel Silver for the drowning of his assistant, Carmel Musgrove, who was found dead while celebrating Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s honeymoon in 2015.  According to the papers obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Silver\u2019s company, Silver Pictures, flew the 28-year-old out to the Four Seasons Hotel in Bora Bora along with others on a chartered Gulfstream to celebrate the marriage of Aniston and Theroux.  On August 18, 2015, Musgrove reportedly went on a fishing trip and then had dinner with Silver\u2019s family, where alcohol was supplied.  Related: Happily Wedded Bliss!

The lawsuit \u2014 which was filed on Friday, August 18, in L.A. County Superior Court \u2014 claims that after dinner, Musgrove went to the bungalow of Silver\u2019s personal chef, Martin Herold, and indulged in cocaine and marijuana before retreating back to her room around 11 p.m. She reportedly sent a message to Herold that said \u201cXxx\u201d around midnight and asked hotel staff for matches. The staff member who supplied the matches was allegedly the last person to see her alive.  After more than a day of searching, her nude body was found floating in a lagoon just 500 yards away from her bungalow.  The suit questions how an email managed to be sent from her account at 7:04 a.m., if she had died during a midnight swim. It also states that Musgrove\u2019s death was due in part to alcohol, cocaine, work fatigue, heat stroke and swimming in choppy waters.  After Musgrove\u2019s death, Silver\u2019s publicist released a statement that said, \u201cJoel Silver, his family and his staff are devastated by the passing of Carmel Musgrove. Carmel was a dear friend and respected colleague with a very bright future ahead of her.

She was seeking help during the last five years, \"seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,\" Andy Spade said in a statement released on Wednesday.  He said there were \"personal demons she was battling.\"  The designer was found by a housekeeper hanged in the bedroom of her Park Avenue apartment on Tuesday. She was 55 years old and had a 13-year-old daughter. While investigators were still in the early stages of their inquiry, the NYPD's chief of detectives, Dermot Shea, said evidence including a note pointed to \"a tragic suicide.\"  [NY-NATL] Remembering NYC Fashion Icon Kate Spade  Spade was working as an accessories editor at Mademoiselle magazine when she launched her company with her husband in their apartment in 1993.  Andy Spade, the brother of comedian David Spade, said she \"sounded happy\" the night before her suicide.  \"There was no indication and no warning that she would do this,\" he said. \"It was a complete shock.\"  He said he and his wife had been living separately for the past 10 months but saw each other or spoke every day. He said they were not legally separated and never discussed divorce.  Coach, now known as Tapestry, bought the Kate Spade brand last year for $2.4 billion. The couple recently had started a new handbag company, Frances Valentine.  \"We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how,\" Andy Spade said.  Kate Spade's sister, Reta Saffo, released her own statement late Tuesday saying she believed that Kate Spade had bipolar disorder and had a hard time with it. Those comments sparked backlash within hours, with a source close to the family saying Spade's relatives were \"disgusted\" by Saffo's remarks, and that Saffo had been estranged from the \"entire family\" for a decade.  Saffo said of her sister, however: \"My little sister Katy was a precious, precious little person. Genuine in almost every way.\"  The sudden death of the iconic designer left fans, celebrities and fashion industry insiders reeling. Brother-in-law David Spade posted a photo on Instagram of him with Kate, writing, \"She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still can't believe it.\"  Read Andy Spade's entire statement below, as provided to NBC News:  \"Kate was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was the kindest person I\u2019ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can\u2019t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.  Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn\u2019t her. There were personal demons she was battling.  For the past 10 months we had been living separately, but within a few blocks of each other. Bea was living with both of us and we saw each other or spoke every day. We ate many meals together as a family and continued to vacation together as a family. Our daughter was our priority. We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce. We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how. We were together for 35 years. We loved each other very much and simply needed a break.  This is the truth. Anything else that is out there right now is false. She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last 5 years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety. There was no substance or alcohol abuse. There were no business problems. We loved creating our businesses together. We were co-parenting our beautiful daughter. I have yet to see any note left behind and am appalled that a private message to my daughter has been so heartlessly shared with the media.  My main concern is Bea and protecting her privacy as she deals with the unimaginable grief of losing her mother. Kate loved Bea so very much.\"  ***  Here is information on suicide prevention from the National Institute of Mental Health.

        "doc_2_text": "Video  Image Brad Pitt reportedly 'begged' Angelina Jolie to delay divorce 1:10 Brad Pitt reportedly 'begged' Angelina Jolie to delay their divorce but it's believed the actress wanted to settle things quickly.  Staff writers News Corp Australia Network  SHE was accused of breaking up Brad Pitt\u2019s marriage to Jennifer Aniston, a woman beloved by his mother. So how did the tattooed, outspoken Angelina Jolie find her place in the all American Pitt clan?  The Pitt family hail from Missouri, and aside from Brad who catapulted to fame in 1991, they all live fairly regular, suburban lives. His mother Jane was a school counsellor while his father William was a truck company manager.  Brad is the eldest of three children, his brother Doug Pitt is an American businessman, investor and philanthropist and has three children of his own while his sister Julie Pitt, who founded a charity, has five children of her own, two adopted from Ethiopia.  Brad has previously spoken about his upbringing in the Southern Baptist household telling the Telegraph magazine that his father was \u201cvery, very tough\u201d and that he and his siblings were raised \u201cwith all the Christian guilt about what you should and shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d  In contrast Angelina came from a family of fame but it was a broken home. Her parents divorced when she was less than a year old and she has had a dysfunctional relationship with her actor father, Jon Voight, their previous estrangement playing out in the public sphere with barbs traded back and forth.  While Brad is said to share a close bond with his siblings Jolie went a step further when she famously locked lips with her only sibling, brother James Haven, at the Oscars in 2000.  Jolie has also admitted to enduring rebellious and turbulent years during her teens and 20s, describing periods of self-harm and drug use saying she had used \u201cjust about every drug possible,\u201d particularly heroin.  Jolie had been married twice before she met Brad to British actor Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton while Brad had only been married once before to Aniston.  Jolie turned up to her first wedding in black rubber pants and a white t.shirt with the groom\u2019s name written in blood and wore the blood of her second husband in a vial around her neck. Brad and Aniston\u2019s marriage was however seen as the perfect union of two big stars. Aniston, the wholesome actress we came to love on hit show Friends seemed to slot perfectly into the Pitt family.  After their divorce in 2005, which came about after Brad and Jolie admitted to falling in love on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Aniston still kept a foot in the Pitt family with Jane unable to let go of the daughter-in-law she loved so much.  Doug revealed to Star magazine in 2006 that his mother still spoke to Aniston on the phone every single week.  \u201cBrad is not happy about Mum talking to Jennifer. He feels that Mum should move on now, and cut the link that was there. But she is in a difficult position \u2014 she has great affection for Jennifer \u2014 born out of the fact Brad once loved her and did marry her.\u201d  But Doug changed his tune in a 2007 interview with People saying it was not odd that the two remained friends.  \u201cJennifer is a friend of Brad\u2019s,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be a friend of ours?\u201d  The pair are still so close that when Aniston married Justin Theroux she reportedly invited Jane to witness the nuptials.  \u201cShe\u2019s closer to her than she is to her own mother Nancy and it just feels right,\u201d a source told The Sun.  With such contrasting upbringings, a mother-in-law who still has such a strong connection to the ex, and a scandalous union Jolie always seemed out of place in the Pitt family.  Radar Online, quoting Star Magazine, reports that Jolie was reportedly mortified after Jane wrote a letter to a Missouri newspaper condemning same-sex marriage and President Barack Obama\u2018s re-election.  Jane wrote, \u201cAny Christian should spend much time in prayer before refusing to vote for a family man with high morals, business experience, who is against abortion, and shares Christian conviction concerning homosexuality just because he is a Mormon.\u201d  Jolie and Brad are both big supporters of same-sex marriage, previously stating they wouldn\u2019t get married until it was legal in the US.  \u201cJane has never wanted to talk politics with Angelina,\u201d a source allegedly told Star as reported by Radar Online.  \u201cShe knew it would cause greater issues for them, and she wanted to try to have a relationship with the mother of her grandkids. She never thought her letter would be such a big deal.\u201d  Previous reports also suggest that Jolie was unimpressed when Jane bought femine clothes for tomboy Shiloh.  But regardless of their differences, and whether there is any truth to the reports of fueding, Jane and Jolie always seemed to be in good spirits when spotted out in public.  And in 2013 when Jolie revealed she had decided to undergo a double mastectomy, citing genetic predispositions towards breast cancer, Jane had nothing but support for her.  \u201cWe\u2019re so very proud of Angie. This means so much to our family especially our grandchildren. We love her dearly,\u201d she said as reported by Perez Hilton.  Only time will tell whether Jolie and Jane will have the kind of long lasting relationship that she shares with Aniston after the divorce is finalised.",

However, it appears that Jolie is eager to move on with her life and has reportedly expressed her desire to quickly settle the matter. Despite their differences, Jolie has always been close to Brad's family, particularly his mother Jane. Jane has been vocal in her support of Jennifer Aniston, Brad's ex-wife, and the two remain close despite their divorce. Jolie, who was raised in a dysfunctional home, has also revealed that she struggled with drug use and self-harm during her teens and 20s. She has been married twice before, once to Jonny Lee Miller and once to Billy Bob Thornton, while Brad has only been married once before to Aniston.

He added that there were no narcotics in his body; only a \"therapeutic dose\" of a nonnarcotic medication. He would not disclose the name of the medication.  De Rocquigny said there were signs of a \"repas arros\u00e9,\" a French term typically translated as a \"boozy dinner.\" He said \"it remains likely\" that Bourdain had \"a high consumption\" of alcohol the night before his death.  He has already said that Bourdain's death did not seem suspicious, and added that there was no indication that his previous findings had changed.  Bourdain, 61, died earlier this month in France. CNN, whom he worked for on his \"Parts Unknown\" series, said the cause of death was suicide.  \"His love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller,\" CNN said in a statement at the time. \"His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.\"  At the time of his death, Bourdain had been in Strasbourg, France filming for \"Parts Unknown.\" The last episode of the series was aired by CNN on Sunday, June 24.

Monteith, 31, was found dead in his Vancouver, British Columbia, hotel room, according to police, who said an autopsy is expected Monday to determine the cause of death.  Police said Monteith had been out with people earlier, but video and electronic records from the hotel indicated he returned to his room by himself early Saturday morning. He was believed to be alone when he died.  Lea Michele, Monteith\u2019s real-life girlfriend who was in Mexico when the news reached her, has pleaded for privacy, but fans from all over the world are tweeting at #LeaMichele, #PrayForLea, #StayStrongLea, #StayStrongLeaMichele, where millions are sending thoughts, prayers and posting pictures of the petite half-Jewish singer/actress with Monteith.  Buzz Feed, which projects \u201cthe viral web in realtime,\u201d has put together a timeline of their relationship, which is also being massively retweeted, alongside memes (images reflecting a cultural trend or idea) such as:  \u201cALL FANDOMS RT AND PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD.

Fans are tweeting around the clock in a Tower of Babel of languages from countries as far-flung as Indonesia, which has recently forged closer ties with Western countries.  Sampai saat ini berita tentang pernikahan Cory Monteith dan Lea Michele masih belum bisa dikonfirmasi atau dianggap benar \u2014 Glee Indonesia (@gleekindonesia) July 15, 2013  In England, what was supposed to be a weekend celebration of the musical TV series turned into an impromptu memorial of song and dance for Monteith after news of the co-star\u2019s death rocked a \u201cGlee\u201d fan convention.  The hundreds of \u201cgleeks,\u201d as they\u2019re known, joined a chorus of thousands worldwide who took to social media with similar expressions about Monteith\u2019s passing. The actor\u2019s struggles with addiction echoed those of other young stars whose premature deaths also left young fans grieving.  \u201cThe whole day was simultaneously the best and worst experience of my life,\u201d said Chloe Harvey, an 18-year-old fan from Portsmouth, England. \u201cThe news was devastating. No one had any idea what to say or do. It just shows how much of a truly amazing guy Cory was that everyone was so shocked and emotional about the news. Everyone was crying and sharing their stories.\u201d  While it\u2019s not known what caused his death, Monteith\u2019s passing recalls the lives of Heath Ledger, Corey Haim and River Phoenix \u2014 actors who battled substance abuse and died in their 20s and 30s. Monteith talked bluntly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager, calling it a serious problem and telling Parade magazine in 2011 he was \u201clucky to be alive.\u201d  Monteith admitted himself to a treatment facility in April for substance addiction and asked for privacy as he took steps toward recovery, a representative said at the time. Michele told People magazine that she loved and supported him and was proud he was seeking help. It was not Monteith\u2019s first time in rehab. He also received treatment when he was 19.  \u201cI think kids really need a place to go and feel like they belong,\u201d he said in the video posted the site for Project Limelight, a Vancouver charity offering theater and arts programs to at-risk youth. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I struggled a lot with who I was and where my life was going and what I was interested in. And I was fortunate to have the arts inspire me.\u201d  Monteith similarly moved fans. At the weekend \u201cGlee\u201d convention, instead of planned revelry like singing competitions and autograph sessions with actors who\u2019ve played members of the rival Warblers glee club, organizers Starfury Conventions rescheduled the final day of the three-day event at Heathrow\u2019s Thistle Hotel so the 250 attendees could mourn him together.  \u201cWe all woke up to hear the story, and no one really wanted to believe it was true,\u201d said Chloe-Louise Bond, a 22-year-old fan from Wakefield, England. \u201cWalking into the main room, you could just feel the tragedy in the air, absolute strangers became a family right in that moment. Everyone was crying and hugging and just trying to get over the shock.\u201d  It was a day filled with sadness and songs. The attendees chanted \u201cCory! Cory! Cory!\u201d In unison, they sang tunes like \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d the Journey cover crooned by Monteith in the high school-set musical\u2019s first episode. Curt Mega, Telly Leung and other actors who\u2019ve played Warblers led a group discussion with fans about their memories of Monteith.  \u201cGlee,\u201d with its catchy song-and-dance numbers and high-profile guest stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Britney Spears, became an instant hit when it debuted in 2009 and made celebrities of Monteith and the rest of the relatively unknown cast. Over the past four seasons, he delivered renditions of such classics as U2\u2032s \u201cOne\u201d and R.E.M.\u2019s \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d  Monteith served as the show\u2019s resident hunk with a heart of gold. He played Finn Hudson, a football quarterback with two left feet who found more camaraderie in the choir room than on the football field. After his character graduated high school, Hudson sought out to find himself before settling on what he wanted to do with his life: become a teacher and mentor.  Outside the Vancouver hotel where Monteith\u2019s body was discovered, a makeshift memorial popped up where fans left flowers and notes commemorating the actor.  Copyright 2013 The Associated Press",

In Itzkoff's book, it's touched on that the late comedian felt threatened by Carrey's success in the 1990s. To make matters worse, Robin Williams was reportedly upset that Jim Carrey took over on the role of the Riddler in 1995's Batman Forever after he turned the role down.  The report in question comes from Radar Online, which isn't always 100 percent accurate in all of its reporting. Jim Carrey has made a statement calling the entire report fabricated and made up after a tiny blurb was mentioned in Dave Itzkoff's biography. Carrey acknowledges that there might have been some insecurity on the part of Williams, but there was absolutely no feud. Carrey explains.  \"RadarOnline is completely off base and creating a feud that didn't exist. Robin may have expressed insecurity about me and my rise to success but I have never had anything but the greatest respect for him and his genius. He was also always respectful to me in person. He called me Maestro and I called him Billy the Kid. Let's get it straight. There's no feud if one side isn't aware of it.\"  In addition to his statement on the so-called feud with Robin Williams, Jim Carrey took a break from painting the Trump administration and shared a new painting that he did of the late comedian on social media. The painting is done in Carrey's unique style and features Robin Williams with a radiating golden glow around him. Carrey continued to heap praise on Williams in the caption of the photo. He says.  \"Robin Williams' mind was a quantum computer. He was the fastest gun in the West. I loved, respected and admired his brilliance - always.\"  This August will be the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams' death. Williams committed suicide on August 14th. The comedian was diagnosed with diffuse Lewy body dementia, which reportedly caused him to lose some of the energy that he was best known for. Williams was misdiagnosed with Parkinson's disease, suffered paranoia, hallucinations, and blank moments at the end of his life. In addition, he didn't feel like he could be funny anymore, according to Itzkoff's biography.  As for Jim Carrey, he's mostly been focusing on painting as a way of social protest after being cleared in the death of his girlfriend. Carrey is a harsh critic of President Trump and creates very unflattering pieces of artwork that portray the president and his administration. While it could be said that he may be in a feud with Trump, he was never in a \"bitter feud\" with the late great Robin Williams.

Carrey acknowledges that Williams may have felt insecure about his own success, but he insists that there was no feud between them.\n\nCarrey furthermore shared a painting he had done of Williams on social media, praising the late comedian's \"brilliance\" and \"genius.\" The painting features Williams with a radiating golden glow around him, and Carrey wrote in the caption that he \"loved, respected and admired\" Williams's work.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Harry has disclosed that he sought counseling after enduring \"total chaos\" for two years while still struggling to come to terms with the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Harry, who lost his mother when he was just 12, says he \"shut down all his emotions\" for almost two decades and only began to address his grief when he was 28, feeling \"on the verge of punching someone\" and facing anxiety during royal engagements.\n\nOverall, it seems that both Carrey and Harry have dealt with the loss of their mothers in their own unique ways, and have found comfort in their respective creative pursuits.",

Speaking with Dr. Phil in an interview that aired Tuesday, the Grammy-nominated singer, 25, reflected back on her struggles and revealed her darkest days first came about as young as 7 years old.  \u201cThe very first time that I was suicidal was when I was 7, and I had this fascination with death,\u201d Lovato said. \u201cI have experienced things that I\u2019ve not talked about and that I don\u2019t know if I ever will talk about. But at 7, I knew that if I were to take my own life that the pain would end.\u201d  Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 18 and bullied at age 12, Lovato turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the demons in her life.  \u201cMy addiction with drugs and alcohol was very severe to where I had several scares, and I knew that at the rate I was using and drinking, I wasn\u2019t going to live a long life. I used very fast, very hard,\u201d she said.  Dr. Phil  But by sharing her trials and tribulations, Lovato hopes to inspire her fans and followers to seek help.  \u201cIf I could tell anybody that\u2019s thinking about taking their own life, is to reach out to people. Don\u2019t hold it inside \u2014 don\u2019t isolate. Reach out to people, whether it\u2019s close friends, family,\u201d she advised. \u201cIf you feel like you don\u2019t have anybody, look within yourself and try to find that resilience that will ultimately get you through whatever it is you\u2019re going through. Every single person on this planet is worth life.\u201d  RELATED VIDEO: Demi Lovato Cries Recalling Past Struggles During Concert as DJ Khaled Celebrates Her Sobriety  The Dr. Phil interview aired days after the Disney Channel alum broke down in tears during her Brooklyn concert when talking about her sober birthday on Friday.  \u201cYesterday was a really big day for me. Yesterday, six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning, throwing up in the car and I just remember thinking, \u2018This is no longer cute. This is no longer fun. And I\u2019m just like my dad,\u2019 \u201d Lovato told concertgoers.  Her biological father, Patrick Lovato, whom Demi had a strained relationship with, died in June 2013 after years of alcohol and substance abuse.

The connection that she has with her two high-profile stepsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, is one that has evolved from some very dark times into something that those around them likely doubted they would ever see. By the time William and Harry were born, their father, Prince Charles, had not only long ago ended his relationship with Camilla, but he didn't see her socially as a friend, either. Charles and Camilla had been romantically involved in their early 20s, but Charles's naval career took him away to sea, and he ended the relationship. Camilla married her ex-boyfriend Andrew Parker-Bowles, and Charles wrote to his godfather, \"I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.\"  The pair initially remained friends and lived near each other. The Parker-Bowles were regular visitors to Charles's country home Highgrove, and Charles was made godfather to their son Tom. When Charles and Diana got engaged, he stopped seeing Camilla socially, and so William and Harry never met her as young boys \u2014 but they certainly heard about her. When Charles and Diana's marriage broke down and they both sought affection elsewhere, Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger toward the woman Diana called \"Charles's lady.\" Charles and Diana separated in 1992, and after five years, he made moves to introduce his sons to the woman he hoped would one day be his wife. In the Summer of 1997, Charles sat down with William and Harry, explained a little about their relationship, and broached the subject of them all meeting \u2014 but William especially was resistant, and Charles knew it would be best to leave it for the time being.  \"Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger towards the woman Diana called 'Charles's lady.'  Diana died two months later, which naturally meant for Charles that it was all about supporting his sons. Over the next year, Charles and Camilla kept their relationship low-key; it was easier to work on building the relationship between Camilla and the queen. Over time, the princes could see that Camilla made their father happy. At the age of 16, William took charge of the inevitable and finally instigated a meeting in June 1998 at the London residence he and Harry lived at with their father, York House at St James's Palace. They spoke on their own for half an hour, and it was reported that it went well, but that afterward, Camilla came out and said \"I need a drink.\" They went on to meet for lunch and afternoon tea soon after and continued getting to know each other. Harry's first meeting with Camilla was more straightforward and came a couple of weeks later, over tea at Highgrove along with her children, Tom and Laura. Over the next seven years, the relationship between Camilla, William, and Harry was built very slowly. When the boys organized a 50th birthday party for Charles in November 1998, they invited Camilla to sit with Charles, although their relationship at that point was still very tentative. Camilla started to stay over at York House when William and Harry were in town, but when they were all at Highgrove together, she would drive back to her own house nearby after dinner, out of respect for the fact that it used to be Diana's house, too.",

        "doc_1_text": "Rose McGowan has spoken out again on Anthony Bourdain\u2018s death, claiming that the late chef and his girlfriend Asia Argento had a \u201cfree relationship.\u201d  \u201cDear Fellow Humans,\u201d she wrote in an open letter. \u201cSitting across from me is the remarkable human and brave survivor, Asia Argento, who has been through more than most could stand, and yet stand she does. She stood up to her monster rapist and now she has to stand up to yet another monster, suicide. The suicide of her beloved lover and ally, Anthony Bourdain.\u201d  \u201cI write these truths because I have been asked to. I know so many around the world thought of Anthony Bourdain as a friend and when a friend dies, it hurts. Many of these people who lost their \u2018friend\u2019 are wanting to lash out and blame. You must not sink to that level. Suicide is a horrible choice, but it is that person\u2019s choice,\u201d she added.  John Nacion/Startraks  Bourdain began dating the Italian actress in 2017, after she appeared on an episode of Parts Unknown filmed in her hometown of Rome. She recently directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong, and Bourdain would often consult her for her rich knowledge of music and film when putting together the series.  Argento was one of the dozens of women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment in 2017 (Weinstein has \u201cunequivocally\u201d denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex\u201d). Bourdain became one of the most outspoken celebrities about the #MeToo era, showing unwavering support for his girlfriend, and even holding a dinner for Argento and fellow Weinstein accusers McGowan and Annabella Sciorra.  Addressing the late chef\u2019s depression, McGowan continued, \u201cAnthony was open with his demons, he even wrote a book about them. In the beginning of their relationship, Anthony told a mutual friend, \u2018He\u2019s never met anyone who wanted to die more than him.\u2019 And through a lot of this last year, Asia did want the pain to stop.\u201d  \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, over their time together, thankfully, she did the work to get help, so she could stay alive and live another day for her and her children. Anthony\u2019s depression didn\u2019t let him, he put down his armor, and that was very much his choice. His decision, not hers. His depression won,\u201d she remarked.  Opening up about the pair\u2019s \u201cfree relationship,\u201d McGowan wrote that \u201cwhen Anthony met Asia, it was instant chemistry. They laughed, they loved and he was her rock during the hardships of this last year.\u201d  Continuing, she wrote that the pair \u201cloved without borders of traditional relationships, and they established the parameters of their relationship early on. Asia is a free bird, and so was Anthony. Was. Such a terrible word to write. I\u2019ve heard from many that the past two years they were together were some of his happiest and that should give us all solace.\u201d  While Bourdain was shooting for Parts Unknown in France before his death, Argento was spotted holding hands with another man in Rome, according to TMZ.  Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock  \u201cAnthony was 61, the same age my father was when he died. My father also suffered from intermittent deep depression, and like Anthony, was part of a \u2018pull up your bootstraps and march on\u2019 generation. The a \u2018strong man doesn\u2019t ask for help\u2019 generation,\u201d she wrote, adding that although Bourdain did reach out for help before taking his life, \u201che did not take the doctor\u2019s advice.\u201d  She also asked fans of the late chef and TV host to \u201cNOT do the sexist thing and burn a woman on the pyre of misplaced blame.\u201d  \u201cAnthony\u2019s internal war was his war, but now she\u2019s been left on the battlefield to take the bullets. It is in no way fair or acceptable to blame her or anyone else, not even Anthony. We are asking you to be better, to look deeper, to read and learn about mental illness, suicide and depression before you make it worse for survivors by judging that which we do not understand, that which can never fully be understood. Sometimes we are stuck in the unknowable, and that is where we are now, a massive wave of darkness that threatens to swallow everyone in its wake,\u201d she added.  Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock; Slaven Vlasic/Getty  The 44-year-old actress went on to implore anybody reading her open letter to \u201cjoin me in sending healing energy to Anthony on his journey, and to all who\u2019ve been left behind to journey on without him. There is no one to blame but the stigma of loneliness, the stigma of asking for help, the stigma of mental illness, the stigma of being famous and hurting,\u201d she continued.  She also added that \u201cAnthony would never have wanted Asia to be hurt,\u201d before urging anyone who might be considering suicide to seek help. \u201cWe need you here. You matter. You exist. You count. There is help a phone call away, reach out,\u201d she added.  RELATED VIDEO: Chefs like Anthony Bourdain Face Constant \u2018Behind-the-Scenes\u2019 Anxieties: \u2018When The Shift Stops What Do You Do?\u2019  On Friday, Bourdain was found unresponsive in his hotel room in Kaysersberg, France, by his close friend Eric Ripert, according to CNN. Both were filming an upcoming episode of Parts Unknown.  Speaking with PEOPLE, French prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny previously said there was no evidence of violence in Bourdain\u2019s death.  In an interview with the New York Times hours after the news of Bourdain\u2019s death, his mother Gladys Bourdain said she had no indication that her son may have been thinking about suicide. However, following his death, she spoke to Ripert who told her that \u201cTony had been in a dark mood these past couple of days.\u201d  If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text \u201chelp\u201d to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org.",

        "doc_2_text": "The 38-year-old singer, who is currently on tour to promote her Beautiful Trauma album, was forced to cancel two concerts last week after contracting a bad case of the flu.  However, those close to workaholic Pink say her jam-packed schedule has been playing havoc on her relationship with husband Carey Hart.  \u2018There\u2019s no denying that Pink is unwell and her health is taking a battering at the moment, but there\u2019s also another big reason that she\u2019s cancelling concerts,\u2019 an insider tells New Idea.  \u2018Carey has been really pushing her to cut back recently, and he isn\u2019t happy with how much time she and the kids are spending away from home \u2013 not to mention the stress it\u2019s putting on their marriage.\u2019  Those close to the couple say that the 42-year-old Motocross star \u2013 who shares daughter Willow, six, and son Jameson, 15 months, with Pink \u2013 said that it was madness for the Just Like A Pill singer to take on such a packed schedule so soon after giving birth to Jameson.  In a recent Instagram post, lonely Carey made it clear how much he was missing his family.  \u2018Missing my crew!!!!!!! One more day, and I\u2019m back on tour,\u2019 he captioned a cute snap of Pink and their kids.  \u2018Carey really feels like he\u2019s been forgotten recently,\u2019 continues the insider.  \u2018They barely spend any time together \u2013 there are no date nights any more, phone calls are rushed, and whenever they see each other, they\u2019re fussing over the kids and are just too tired to spend any real time together.\u2019  It\u2019s no secret the couple \u2013 who have weathered a stormy relationship in the past \u2013 often struggle to make their marriage work.  Back in October, a candid Pink made a shock admission about their lack lustre sex life.  \u2018You\u2019ll go through times when you haven\u2019t had sex in a year. Is this bed death? Is this the end of it? Do I want him? Does he want me?\u2019 she spilled openly to The Guardian.  So it\u2019s no surprise that Carey really wanted Pink to cut some shows from her tour.  \u2018He doesn\u2019t want them to split again, and so he\u2019s been insistent that she put the brakes on her career and spend some more time together as a family. He\u2019s told her she simply has to slow down for the sake of their marriage.  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",

The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE, saying, \u201cWe have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple.\u201d They added, \u201cThere are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision \u2014 just two best-friends realizing it\u2019s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.\u201d  In early March, Dewan, 37, walked the red carpet at the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after party without Tatum. When asked where the actor was, she told Entertainment Tonight he was home with their 4-year-old daughter Everly.  \u201cHe is so happy to have a night off, yes,\u201d she said. Not long after, Tatum, also 37, was spotted dining with a group of friends at Craig\u2019s restaurant without Dewan Tatum.  RELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan \u2018Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate\u2019 After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage  But the actress\u2019s Oscars date night with BFF Emmanuelle Chriqui also wasn\u2019t the only recent solo outing as of late.  Days after the Oscars, Dewan spent the day practicing her magic with Everly at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Los Angeles.  The couple \u2014 who often gushed about each other on social media \u2014 were also uncharacteristically mum over the last few months on their accounts.  However, as buzz of a split grew louder, they put on a united front and attended the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards together with their daughter and also shared cute snaps of a recent pool and face painting day in March.  In February, Dewan opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a \u201cperfect life,\u201d saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.  \u201cWhen people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we\u2019ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.\u201d  Dewan said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn\u2019t get along.  \u201cBut I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the same values. But we\u2019re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don\u2019t really like each other.\u201d  Musing on the institution of marriage, Dewan said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any expectation, any sort of \u2018You\u2019re bonded to me for the rest of your life,\u2019 thick and thin. I think that\u2019s an older generational thought.\u201d  And while the former couple was known for posting countless photos together on social media, Tatum last posted about Dewan in December. He celebrated the actress\u2019 birthday with a heartfelt message.  \u201cThis creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons.

To name her after him is an honor.\"  She added, \"Everyone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.\"  Back in April 2018, Hudson announced she and Fujikawa were having a baby with an Instagram video of their exciting gender-reveal party.  \"My kids, Danny, myself and the entire family are crazy excited!\" Hudson captioned the post, adding that they have \"a little girl on the way.\"  Hudson has two children, Ryder Russell Robinson, 15, and Bingham Hawn Bellamy, 8, from previous relationships with Chris Robinson and Matt Bellamy, respectively. She and Fujikawa began dating a little more than a year ago, and this will be the couple's first child together.  Here is everything you need to know about the first-time dad.  He and Hudson have known each other for more than a decade.  Charley Gallay // Getty Images  Although Fujikawa and Hudson just made their red-carpet debut as an official couple last May, the pair have actually known each other for 15 years. Hudson told The Talk hosts that she first met Fujikawa through her best friends, Sara and Erin Foster.    \"We've known each other for 15 years. He's my best friend's stepbrother,\" she said. \"We kinda skipped through the part of knowing what the hiccups were. You kinda skip the part of going, 'Oh, you're like that?'\"    She added, \"In terms of family, I've known his family forever. To have that connection is really powerful.\"    He's a musician.  Getty Images  It's safe to say Hudson has a thing for rockers after previously being with The Black Crowes' Chris Robinson and Muse's Matthew Bellamy. Fujikawa is the former lead singer and guitarist for the L.A.\u2013based folk rock band Chief, which he cofounded with his brother Michael Fujikawa. The group is now disbanded but still remain friendly. Fujikawa posted a photo with his former bandmates on Instagram on April 30, which prompted many fans to wonder whether Chief was getting back together.    He founded his own record company.      Fujikawa founded Lightwave Records in Los Angeles in 2013, according to his .  He went to NYU.  Getty Images  Fujikawa's LinkedIn profile also states that he went to New York University starting in 2004 where he studied music. However, he did not graduate and dropped out in 2005. His activities while attending the school consisted of \"bartending at Lit lounge, lots of walking, and not going to school.\"  He has two brothers.  Their names are Michael and Brady Fujikawa, and they were all raised in Los Angeles. Fujikawa shared the adorable throwback above for one of his brothers' birthdays.  He is part Japanese.  A discussion on Reddit last year claimed that Hudson's new beau has Japanese roots. The musician has also alluded to his Asian heritage on social media. On July 10, 2017, Fujikawa shared an Instagram photo of an Akira video game with the caption, \"I'm a glass is half Japanese kind of guy.\" And back in 2012, he shared a vintage photo of his \"Ojisan and obachan,\" grandfather and grandmother in Japanese.    Hudson and Fujikawa might get married.  Just this month, Hudson revealed to The Telegraph that she was considering getting married to Fujikawa. The actress said, \"We think about that a lot. Marriage is definitely not a golden ticket\u2014it's not going to solve any challenges in a relationship. But as someone who's lived through \u2026 well, trial and error, I think that the symbolism of marriage, that commitment, is more important to kids than we sometimes think.\"",

But off screen Julia Roberts is as down-to-earth and family-oriented as they come, as she reveals in the December issue of Marie Claire US.    The 48-year-old actress - who is playing Meryl Streep's daughter in the upcoming film August: Osage County - gave real insight into her genuinely authentic lifestyle, admitting she cooks three meals a day, sews for her three children, and steers clear of the internet.    A real star: Julia Roberts gave insight into her noble, homely habits and working with Meryl Streep in a Marie Claire interview for the magazine's December issue  Classic: The 46-year-old Academy Award winning actress spoke of how she avoids the internet  Julia - who won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich - explains why she avoids social media.    'It's kind of like cotton candy,' she said, referring to the wonderfully bottomless pit that is the internet.  'It looks so appealing and you just can't resist getting in there, and then you just end up with sticky fingers and it lasted an instant.'    And the Eat Pray Love actress refrains from typing her name into Google's scary search box, too, noting that she can afford to live without the limitless supply of subjective opinions.    'I have too much potential for collapse,' she said, before adding her theories on why criticism comes so easily online: 'There's an anonymity that makes people feel safe to participate in hatefulness.'    Not that she can't handle criticism in general, however.    'I like a good old-fashioned fist fight if people are pissed off at each other,' she explained. 'I just feel like if you're really mad and want to have a fight, then put your dukes up.'    She also discussed her admiration of Hilary Clinton, her 'personal hero', and how she got the opportunity to sit in on the inspiring politician's philanthropic meetings as a 'fly on the wall.'    And hearing about the work of women's groups in less fortunate parts of the world led Julia to reflect on and appreciate her own family practices.    'It's my privilege and an honour to cook three meals a day for my family, and its a luxury on a level that I didn't even realize,' the hardworking actress and mother said.  Julia has three children - twins Hazel and Phinnaeus, aged nine, and Henry, aged six - with her husband Danny Moder.    Julianne Nicholson, who plays Julia's sister in the upcoming movie August: Osage County, gave even more insight into Julia's homely habits.    'I would go in the trailer, and she would be sewing sleeping bags for Hazel's dolls,' the actress said.    And it's clear that family life is truly what drives the star's happiness.    'I feel super kind of happy,' she gushed, when complimented by Marie Claire's guest interviewer Ryan Murphy (Glee) on her appearance, explaining, 'which I think translates to pretty, because my husband is home.'  Screen gem: Julia is an icon of film but explained how she still looks up immensely to Meryl Streep  And although her own career is enviable, it seems she still looks up to Meryl Streep with humble admiration - like most do.    Speaking about how she felt about the lead-up to working with the award-winning actress on the comedy/drama August: Osage County, she revealed, 'I had many imaginary conversations with Meryl about working together.'    She explained to Marie Claire that it was the work of their agent Kevin Huvane - by whom the pair of actresses are both represented - that brought them together on the film.    'As my career is slowing down, he thought, \"I've got to figure this out before she brings it all to a screeching halt in favor of car pools,''' she said in good humour, about a career that one can only imagine would never truly slow down unless she demanded that it be so.",

I believe in partnership, I believe in companionship,\u201d she explained. \u201cI just don\u2019t know I believe in the ceremony of a wedding.\u201d (In case you forgot, Faris was first married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008.)  Funnyman Shepard, 43, went on to ask Faris if she felt any pressure around her decision to split from Pratt since many fans viewed them as \u201c#couplegoals.\u201d Shepard, who is married to Kristen Bell, prefaced the question by revealing he feels pressure around his own relationship with 37-year-old Bell, since the internet also idolizes them as a couple.  \u201cChris and I did talk about [letting people down],\u201d Faris said. \u201cWe got on the Twitter feed, [saw] the \u2018love is dead\u2019, \u2018relationship goals.'\u201d  She elaborated: \u201cI think what we were also guilty of, although we had an unbelievable marriage\u2026 we obviously cultivated something. And it was rewarding for awhile. It was like, \u2018Oh people seem to think we got all this shit alright.'\u201d  Um, is this not the most honest discussion about the reality of Hollywood relationships you\u2019ve heard from an A-lister?!  A post shared by Anna Faris (@annafaris) on Aug 6, 2017 at 8:02pm PDT  Shepard then asked Faris if she felt a sense of \u201cembarrassment\u201d now that the world knows her relationship with Pratt wasn\u2019t as peachy as it appeared to be from the outside, and asked if she worries about fans feeling lied to.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if embarrassment is quite the right word, [but] something akin to that, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a little bit of a childish feeling like, Oh come on f-cking grow up, like a little anger [around the idea]. But that isn\u2019t fair either, because we intentionally cultivated the idea of \u2018look at this beautiful family.'\u201d  But before you start to question everything Faris and Pratt happily posted on Instagram, Faris said their public personas were based on a meaningful relationship. \u201cThere there were so many moments that were like that,\u201d she told Shepard. \u201cBut of course, just like anything on social media, you don\u2019t post like, \u2018Where the f-ck is the toilet paper?!\u2019\u201d  \u201cI think [social media] is a very hard forum to be genuine on, and I think it does a disservice to people to not be.\u201d  It\u2019s super refreshing that Faris is being so real about her marriage and the way social media has influenced people\u2019s perception of it. After all, we\u2019ve all been guilty of putting personal stock into her relationship with Pratt.  We wish you nothing but happiness, Anna\u2014online and off.

The 53-year-old American-Australian personality erupted into tears when she recalled the heartbreaking moment she found out that he had died, after he was attacked by a stingray on Queensland's Batt Reef.  Talking to ABC's Anh's Brush With Fame, the mother-of-two said she'll never move on from Steve and find another partner, saying: 'I'm just lonely for Steve.'  Scroll down for video  'I'm just lonely for Steve': Terri Irwin reveals she's never overcome her grief at losing her 'soulmate' as she recalls the heartbreaking moment she was told he had been killed by a stingray  'I always felt with Steve, if I hadn't married Steve I wouldn't have gotten married,' Terri said, with the pair tying the knot in the US in June 1992, four months after getting engaged.  She said when she first met Steve she wasn't even looking for love, but their connection was instant.  'I wasn't even dating, I wasn't even looking. I was 27-years-old and figured my life was going to be my work and met Steve and fell instantly in love,' she recalled.  'We instantly fell in love': She said when she first met Steve she wasn't even looking for love, but their connection was instant  Terri went on to describe Steve as her 'soulmate' and said she isn't interested in dating since he passed away.  'I feel that we had that soulmate thing. And in the ten years since, I haven't dated or even thought about it. Because I'm not afraid to be on my own.'  She added: 'It's just really hard not having Steve. I'm just lonely for Steve if that makes sense.'  Terri spoke about how she deals with her grief, and said she's never overcome it.  'Grief hits you at the most bizarre times. So I might be talking to biology students and it will remind me of Steve and I will burst into tears.'  'I'm not afraid to be on my own': She said she isn't interested in dating after losing Steve  She added: 'You don't ever get over grief. It changes, but you never wake up one morning and go, \"oh, I'm done with that.\"  'That was the challenge in the journey after Steve died.'  Steve was killed by a stingray in a freak accident 11 years ago at the age of 44, leaving behind Terri to look after their children, Bindi, 19, and Robert, 14.  Bindi was eight at the time of her father's death, while Robert was just two-years-old.  Terri was in Tasmania with Bindi and Robert when Steve passed away, after a stingray barb pierced his chest - shocking the world.  Family: Steve was killed by a stingray in a freak accident 11 years ago at the age of 44, leaving behind Terri to look after their children, Bindi, 19, and Robert, 14  Steve was shooting the documentary, Ocean's Deadliest, while she took the kids interstate while he worked.  Terri spoke about the last time she and the kids saw Steve, saying he was when he was waving goodbye to them as they caught the plane to Tasmania.  'I felt so bad for Robert because he was too little,' Terri said.  'He was in his seat belt and fun police [referring to herself] didn't take the seat belt off so he could see his dad and wave goodbye. And that was the last time we saw him,' she said.  Terri said she arrived in Tasmania and was told to call a zoo manager - who told her about Steve's death, leaving her shocked and heartbroken.  'What do I do next?' Terri said she arrived in Tasmania and was told to call a zoo manager - who told her about Steve's death, leaving her shocked and heartbroken  'I just remember this incredible sense of responsibility,' Terri said.  'This feeling of overwhelming grief but, it was like, \"what do I do next?\"  'So I kind of collected my thoughts and then I had to go out to the car and tell Bindi and Robert, which was really hard.'  Arrangements were soon made for the family to fly back to Australia Zoo, with a private plane being arranged and a car to the airport.  Terri cried when she recalled how she chose to drive herself and the children to the plane.  Sad: She spoke about the last time she and the kids saw Steve, saying he was when he was waving goodbye to them as they caught the plane to Tasmania  'So I got in the car and they said, \"we'll drive you to the airport.\" And I said, \"no.\"  She added: 'So I drove myself, got in the plane and went home. But the thing I didn't expect or understand was just how it affected everyone.'  'So we got back and it was dark, and we drive into the zoo and there's all this media out front of the zoo.'  'And I thought, \"you've done the story. It has been on the five o'clock news. Why are you still here?\" But then no one would have been more surprised than Steve at that, just outpouring of grief and love,' Terri said.",

'There is a caveat to that; I do have a New Year's Eve show in Nashville every year so many have to go back and do that before the Australian tour starts,' he said.  Land Down Under! The singer, his famous wife Nicole Kidman (above) and their two daughters Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith Margaret, 7, will travel to Australia for the holidays  The tour will start at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre on January 23, and will include two concerts in Sydney and Brisbane.  The singer will also perform one show in Canberra and one in Melbourne.  It comes after a preview was released for Keith's tell-all performance on Interview with Andrew Denton, which will air on Tuesday.  Touring again! The singer will bring his latest tour Graffiti U to Australia in January. The shows will kick-off in Newcastle with shows in Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and Melbourne  In the preview, Keith praised his wife for staging a successful intervention for him in 2006 amid his substance abuse issues.  Soon after the couple married in 2006, Keith entered rehab for drugs and alcohol for the third and final time.  Obviously grateful to his wife for helping turn his life around, Keith says it was a palpable sign of love.  'My wife put an intervention together - it was love in action,' he confides to Denton.  Speaking to Rolling Stone magazine in 2016, Keith admitted that it was a 'miracle' that his marriage survived his addictions.  'I caused the implosion of my fresh marriage,' he said. 'It survived, but it's a miracle it did.'  'It was love in action': Keith Urban struggled to contain his emotions as he recalled how his beloved wife Nicole Kidman staged an intervention for him amid his substance abuse issues  He added: I was spiritually awoken with her. I use the expression: 'I was born into her,' and that's how I feel. And for the first time in my life, i could shake off the shackles of addiction.  Elsewhere in his Denton interview, Keith became emotional again while talking about his two children, Faith Margaret and Sunday Rose.  'You've got two little girls. How do you keep things normal for them?' Andrew asks.  With his voice cracking, Keith replied: ' When you've got to be dad.'",

He said he's had a crush on her since he was 8 years old, and that he freaked out when they first met.  Actors Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet have been one of Hollywood's cutest and most interesting couples for more than a decade now. And although they usually keep things pretty private, following the news of their recent secret wedding, Momoa has been sharing some sweet tidbits about their relationship.  Advertisement  Momoa, 38, appeared on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" and when Corden congratulated him on his recent nuptials, he happily flashed his new wedding ring. Though he and Bonet, 49, have been together for about 12 years, Momoa told Corden that their love story actually began 30 years ago, when he saw her on TV.  \"Listen it was more than [love at first sight]. Ever since I was 8 years old and I saw her on the TV I was like, 'Mommy, I want that one,'\" Momoa gushed. \"I was like, 'I'm going to stalk you for the rest of my life, and I'm going to get you.' I'm a full-fledged stalker.\"  \"But yeah, I've just always wanted to meet her. She was a queen, always,\" he continued.  Despite Momoa's apparent convictions to making Bonet his wife one day, the story of how they actually met is a lot cuter. Momoa said that they met through mutual friends at a jazz club and he, understandably, freaked out about meeting his childhood crush.  Advertisement  \"I literally turned around and I see her and she goes, ya know, 'I'm Lisa,'\" he recalled. \"I turned around to my friend and I was like 'ahhh!' I had f------ fireworks going off inside man.\"  These two love a good brew. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Afterwards, Momoa said he \"convinced her\" to take him home to his hotel and they ended up going out to Cafe 101 in New York City for a meal.  \"We sat down, she ordered a Guinness, and that was it,\" he said.  \"'Cause you love Guinnness, right? You ordered a Guinness tonight,\" Corden said.  Advertisement  \"I beyond love Guinness,\" Momoa said, gesturing to his mug. \"She ordered a Guinness and I ordered grits. We had Guinness and grits, and the rest is history.\"  The two have two children together, Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha Momoa and Lola Iolani Momoa, and he serves as step-dad to Bonet's daughter, actress Zo\u00eb Kravitz.  Based on their long partnership and how lovingly Momoa talks about Bonet, I think it's safe to say that they will be sharing many more pints of Guinness and many more bowls of grits together as a married couple.

Kimmel joked that Faris was like a \"sugar mommy\" even back then.\n\nFaris also discussed her struggles with puberty, admitting that she didn't have big boobs but did have something else. Despite her past insecurities, Faris has gone on to have a successful acting career and is now mom to a five-year-old son named Jack. She shares co-parenting responsibilities with ex-husband Chris Pratt.\n\nFaris recently started her own podcast, \"Unqualified,\" and has been vacationing with her new boyfriend, Michael, since October. Despite the ups and downs of her personal life, Faris seems to be doing well and is grateful for the support of her tribe of fellow moms, including Kristen Bell and Reese Witherspoon.",

At the Los Angeles premiere of his new animated flick Smallfoot on Saturday, the 38-year-old actor opened up to Entertainment Tonight about his only child\u2019s independent personality.  \u201cShe\u2019s on the ground, rolling around. Every kid is up doing the proper stuff, but she\u2019s just doing her own thing,\u201d Tatum said of Everly\u2019s participation in dance class, admitting \u201cShe kinda came out that way\u201d more so than himself or ex Jenna Dewan instilling a sense of spunk in their daughter.  \u201cI wish I could take credit for that, but I can\u2019t, really,\u201d said the proud dad. \u201cThat\u2019s really all her.

Albert L.

She cool AF!\u201d he captioned the shot. \u201cAnd that I will never even come close to how f-ing cool she is. I\u2019m proud and feeling some pangs of dad dork growing.\u201d  Addressing the post with ET, the actor said, \u201cI think everybody would think that was cool. \u2026 I\u2019m just watching her, and she\u2019s in a lone group of kids, and it\u2019s how they say, \u2018Be quiet\u2019 at assembly, and she\u2019s just the lone one, just holding it up and just being solid about it. Real calm. And I was like, \u2018Solidarity.\u2019 \u201d  Chris Polk/KCA2018/Getty  Tatum has long been an advocate for his daughter embracing her true and complete self, regardless of what others may pressure her into being. In May 2017, he wrote an essay for Cosmopolitan praising Dewan, 37, and revealing how he wants Everly to dismiss \u201cpreconceived standards\u201d and instead focus on what makes her feel empowered.  \u201cI tried to imagine the things I\u2019d want her to read that would help her understand men and sex and partnership better, and at that moment, I realized a strange thing,\u201d wrote the Magic Mike star.  \u201cI don\u2019t want her looking to the outside world for answers. My highest hope for her is just that she has the fearlessness to always be her authentic self, no matter what she thinks men want her to be.\u201d  \u201cI guess if there\u2019s one thing that I think men wish women knew, it\u2019s just that they alone are enough,\u201d added Tatum, who announced his split from Dewan in April after nine years of marriage. \u201cWhen more women start to truly feel this power in themselves, the world will become so magical, it makes my head hurt.\u201d",

There had been speculation that he was the unnamed comedian mentioned in her book Drinking & Dating.  Will Y\u2019All Just Leave Brandi Glanville The Fuck Alone?  She said that they dated, he made her laugh a lot and that he went on to become super famous . She didn't say they were in a full on relationship, she didn't say they were engaged and she didn't say they were even involved.  She said they dated\u2014which indicates casual hooking up (or however you define dating these days).  LeAnn Rimes Slams Brandi Glanville For Mentioning Eddie Cibrian\u2019s Giant Penis  They both moved on, Stiller married Christine Taylor in 2000 and Brandi married Eddie Cibrian in 2001 before he cheated on her and eventually left her for LeAnn Rimes. Brandi went on to star in Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and is now an outspoken author, radio host and reality star (so amusing to think about how Eddie must wake up every day pig sick that he backed the wrong horse).  Fast forward a couple of decades and on Wednesday night, Stiller appeared on Watch What Happen's Live to promote his new movie Zoolander 2. Cheeky little Andy Cohen, who clearly had an agenda, got him to play a game of 'Plead The Fifth'.  Andy Cohen Hilariously Gets Gwyneth Paltrow To Admit Taking Hard Drugs  He could have pleaded...  Andy cut straight to it and opened with; \"We love a Real Housewives tie in on WWHL...\"  Stiller knew what was coming and looked embarrassed and caught on the hop as he swiveled his chair uncomfortably.  Scroll down for the video  He eventually explained about Brandi;  \"It was fun...I wouldn't call it a relationship...it was just a couple of dates.\"  Talk about trying to play it down! Brandi said exactly the same thing\u2014she didn't say they were in a relationship, just dating and it's downright ungentlemanly of him to try to minimize it.  3inder\u2014The Newest (and Kinkiest) Hookup App  The reason for his squirming may have had something to do with the fact that he then admitted that his wife doesn't even know he has history with the sexiest real housewife out there.  We find that kinda weird. You've been married to your wife for ever, so presumably she's pretty secure in the relationship (you would hope). When Brandi got famous and you maybe caught sight of her on TV or at an event or something, wouldn't you be like \"oh I dated that girl years ago\"? Given the nature of Hollywood gossip, it's not like it would remain a secret\u2014and neither should it, they were both single, so where's the harm?  As Andy said; \"It's going to be 'fun' watching real housewives together now!\"  Real Housewives Craziest Fights, Insane Meltdowns And Brawls Ranked  Douchebags...  In fact, his response was actually a pretty crappy move by Stiller\u2014Gerard Butler was the same when he tried to undermine the fact that he hooked up with Brandi. What, just because they are actors and she's a reality star they're embarrassed to be associated with her? They're too many rungs above her in the celebrity pecking order and shouldn't be seen to be mixing?  We can't think of any other reason why these guys feel they have to explain themselves for dating her. Seriously WTF is the problem? She's gorgeous, doesn't take herself too seriously and likes to have a good time.  If she was hot enough to date, fucking own it, douches.

        "generated_text": "Ben Stiller has recently come under fire for minimizing his past relationship with Brandi Glanville, which took place in the '90s. During a game of \"Plead the Fifth\" on Watch What Happens Live, Andy Cohen grilled Stiller about his past with the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, to which Stiller responded that they only went on \"a couple of dates.\" This admission has sparked controversy, as many feel that Stiller should own his past relationship with Glanville, rather than try to downplay it.\n\nGlanville herself has also come under fire for her past romantic history. She was previously linked with Eddie Cibrian, who later cheated on her with LeAnn Rimes. Glanville has since moved on and is now an outspoken author, radio host, and reality star. It's amusing to think about how Cibrian must wake up every day feeling \"pig sick\" that he backed the wrong horse.\n\nStiller, on the other hand, has been married to Christine Taylor since 2000. However, it seems that his past relationship with Glanville is still causing him some discomfort, as evidenced by his awkward response during the Watch What Happens Live game. It's unclear why Stiller feels the need to explain his past relationship with Glanville, but it's possible that he doesn't want his wife to know about it.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Stiller and Glanville's past relationship, both have moved on and are now successful in their respective careers. It's important to remember that celebrities are people too, and they have the right to date whoever they choose. As long as they're not hurting anyone, there's no reason to judge their past romantic history.",

The 42-year-old country star gushed about his relationship with the 48-year-old singer in a preview for the June 24 episode of Sunday Today with Willie Geist. Advertisement  \"Now here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by, it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us,\" Shelton told host Willie Geist.  \"It constantly feels like it's going to the next level. That's the only way I think either one of us could probably describe it,\" he added.  Shelton and Stefani confirmed their relationship in November 2015 following their splits from their respective spouses, Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale. The couple found support and comfort in each other after their divorces.  \"When I was going through my divorce, I hit rock bottom just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,\" Shelton said. \"It's a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time.\"  Advertisement  \"I think if Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought, 'This is a rebound deal,' because we're both coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives and we're kind of clinging to each other to get through this,\" he added.  Stefani thanked Shelton for sharing his world with her after spending Tuesday at Lake Texoma with the country singer and her son Apollo. She sent love to Shelton the day previous on his 42nd birthday.  \"Happy b day @blakeshelton #iloveuthemost #yourmyfavorite gx,\" the singer wrote.",

Especially, Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian.  According to an August 1 report by People Magazine, a brand new sneak peek was released of the upcoming season, and it appears that Kim and Kourtney will be at each other\u2019s throats.  In the clip, Kim Kardashian is trying to set up a photo shoot and is having a hard time moving things around to fit it into her very busy schedule. Meanwhile, Kourtney is complaining that she needs to be out of the shoot by four o\u2019clock, which is making her younger sister increasingly angry.  The girls\u2019 mother, Kris Jenner, enters the picture and tries to calm tensions by telling Kourtney to \u201cbe nice.\u201d However, she doesn\u2019t help matters. The sisters begin screaming at one another.  \u201cIf I\u2019m out by four [o\u2019clock], that\u2019s all I need. If [I get there] and no one\u2019s ready, and I\u2019m, like, lingering around, I\u2019m leaving at 4 p.m., and I don\u2019t care what anyone says,\u201d Kourtney Kardashian states in the clip.  When Kim Kardashian tells her sister that she is supposed to having a meeting and can only schedule it for 7 a.m., Kourtney tells her to reschedule the meeting in an unsympathetic way. This is the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, and Kim gets fed up.  \u201cNo one wants you in the f\u2014ing shoot.

According to a sneak peek of the upcoming season, the sisters are seen arguing over a photo shoot. Kim is trying to set up a photo shoot but is having a hard time fitting it into her busy schedule, while Kourtney is complaining that she needs to be out of the shoot by four o'clock. When Kim tells her sister that she has a meeting at seven a.m., Kourtney tells her to reschedule the meeting in an unsympathetic way. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back and Kim gets fed up. The sisters begin screaming at one another and things get heated. Kourtney tells Kim that she has no interest in doing the photo shoot anyway and Kim says that she is the \"least exciting to look at.\" Kris Jenner takes Kim's side in the argument and tells Kourtney that she is being \"annoying\" and that she has a way of \"rubbing people the wrong way.\" The new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres on Sunday at 9 p.m. on E!.",

        "doc_1_text": "Kim Kardashian was less than impressed with Scott Disick on Sunday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  The 37-year-old reality star criticized Scott, 34, for going to Cannes in May with Bella Thorne, 20, while her sister Kourtney was there with new beau Younes Bendjima.  'They looked so desperate at the airport. Who goes to LAX together? It's not a good look for Scott,' Kim said to her sister Kendall.  Not impressed: Kourtney Kardashian was critical of Scott Disick's behavior in Cannes during Sunday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians  'He talked to me about it. He thinks it is and I said, ''Are you nuts? Are you actually not well?'' And he was like, ''Yeah, I'm doing it to make Kourtney mad.'' I said, ''You're not going to make her mad for the right reasons'',' Kendall said.  Kim later shared her frustration.  'I think it's clear to everyone that Scott's doing this just to try to one-up Kourtney and that seems super malicious,' Kim said.  She added: 'Kourtney's genuinely trying to go away and have a good time and he's trying to like freak her out and make Kourtney think there's going to be some crazy drama run-in. It's just so ridiculous.'  Bad look: The Kardashians thought Scott went to Cannes just to annoy Kourtney  Party guy: Scott showed up at the airport with Bella Thorne on his way to Cannes  Kourtney, 38, meanwhile called her ex Scott a 'psychopath' after he threatened to have people attack Younes in Cannes.  She earlier told her siblings how she was fielding requests from Scott to 'move in' with her and their three children.  'He's like, ''we could raise the kids together and have an open relationship'',' she balked.  Moving in: Kourtney told her sisters how Scott said he wanted to move in with her  Totally confused: The reality star admitted she was confused by Scott's behavior  'Scott and I are not in a good place, he's been partying\u2026is he serious?' she asked Khlo\u00e9.  Kourtney was due to take a trip to Cannes to hang out with her 28-year-old toyboy.  'I'd rather Scott did not know,' she mused, but Scott decided to go to Cannes with his lady friend Bella.  Cannes trip: Kourtney and Kendall went to Cannes together  'It is crazy that Scott won't leave Kourtney alone,' said Khlo\u00e9.  'He's threatening me now, he's like ''your little friend is going to get beat up every single day when we're there'',' said Kourtney.  'He's ''like you're the love of my life'' and I'm so confused right now\u2026' she added, calling her ex a 'psychopath'.  Dark and twisted: Khloe Kardashian said that Scott can be 'dark and twisted'  'He's dark and twisted\u2026I can't believe he would stoop this low and speak to her this way, she's still the mother of his children,' said Khlo\u00e9, 33.  Khlo\u00e9 then tried to call Scott repeatedly, but he wouldn't pick up.  'There's a lot of anger,' admitted Scott, who eventually answered his cell.  Big sigh: A conversation with Scott left Khloe sighing in her closet  'I never thought I'd ever go through anything like this,' he said tearfully, while admitting to being a 'hothead' and an 'idiot'.  'I'm not going to regret that, because it's how I felt at the time,' he said.  The trip involved Younes rubbing oil into Kourtney's swimsuit-clad body.  Holding hands: Kourtney and Kendall held hands while in Cannes together  Good times: Kourtney was joined by her friend Simon Huck in Cannes  'I'm not trying to throw anything in anyone's face, but I'm also not going to hide,' Kourtney said.  Kourtney earlier told Kim that Kim's assistant Stephanie Shepherd felt 'unfulfilled' in her job.  'I think that's a little bit inappropriate for her to talk to you and not to me,' huffed Kim, calling the move 'unprofessional'.  Candid conversation: Kourtney told Kim that her assistant Stephanie was 'unfulfilled' in her job  Things were 'awkward' with Steph as they planned outfits for Cannes.  Eventually Kim summoned the courage to confront Steph, who brushed it off as 'an in passing thing'.  Kim offered her the opportunity to have more responsibility in her businesses.  Face to face: Steph and Kim sat down for a face-to-face talk about her future  'I don't want me being friends with Kourtney to be like, a thing,' said Steph.  'You're my number one, I've got your back,' she claimed.  In another storyline Kim, 37, wasn't sure which way to sway in the Planned Parenthood debate.  Informed opinion: Kim wanted to have an informed opinion about Planned Parenthood  'I want to have an opinion on this but I just don't know enough, there's nothing worse\u2026I do like to speak up on social media, I want to be more informed,' she said.  'I think we should go there and educate ourselves,' vowed Kim, after Khlo\u00e9 said she was 'pro choice'.  They visited Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles where it was explained that the 100-year-old service primarily provides 'life saving cancer screenings, STD treatments and birth control'.  'Ninety percent of the work we do is preventative care,' said Sue Dunlap, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood in LA.  Group meeting: Sue Dunlap of Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles educated Kim, Kourtney and Khloe about the 100-year-old group  They were asked to write their 'relationship declarations', but Kourtney struggled.  'She's been in an unhealthy relationship for so long that she didn't know what to write, I think it's time she figured out what she deserves in a relationship,' said Kim.  'She's not good at expressing her feelings,' agreed Khlo\u00e9.  Relationship goals: The sisters were asked to fill out their relationship goals  They met a cancer survivor who had been diagnosed at PP, plus a woman who had considered an abortion but had been told to 'sleep on it' by an empathetic medic who sensed her apprehension. The woman ended up keeping her son.  They also met with a patient who had contracted HIV from her boyfriend.  Personal story: A woman who considered abortion shared her story with the Kardashians  Heavy topics: Kim, Kourtney and Khloe listened to stories from Planned Parenthood patients  'Hearing the stories was eye opening,' said Kourtney.  'I'm a big fan of Planned Parenthood now,' decided Khlo\u00e9.  KUWTK returns next week on the E! network.  A recent resigning of the family's deal for $150 million means they will be on air until at least 2019.",

The 37-year-old reality star mocked Scott\u2019s behaviour in the aftermath of his split from Kourtney Kardashian, saying he was clearly acting out as a way of getting revenge on his ex-girlfriend.

After many arguments between Khloe, Kim, and Kourtney have broken out, on Sunday night, Kourtney was wrapped up in the drama again, and this time, it was all about the family's holiday plans.  This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.  On Sunday night's episode of \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians,\" the family fought over their plans for the holidays.  Kourtney Kardashian didn't want to attend the family Christmas party because Scott Disick would be there, and she wanted to bring then-boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  In the end, both Kardashian and Disick ended up attending, and so did Bendjima.  Basically, the argument was about whether or not Scott Disick would be invited to Kris Jenner's annual Christmas party. The rest of the family thought that Disick should obviously be in attendance \u2014 even though he and Kourtney are no longer together, he's still Mason, Reign, and Penelope's father and part of their family.  But Kourtney wanted to bring boyfriend Younes Bendjima (who she has since broken up with) and thought it might be awkward for him and Scott to be at the same party together\u2026 even though Scott swore it wasn't a big deal (for him, at least).  Kendall was totally on Kourtney's side, though, especially since Kris originally didn't want to invite Caitlyn Jenner because nobody at the party \"would even know how to respond to her,\" and of course, Kendall wanted to have both of her parents at the party, too.  Advertisement  Kendall and Kris butted heads about invites too. E!  Kourtney was torn between wanting Scott to be there for their kids and wanting to keep the peace between her ex and her boyfriend \u2026 and, of course, she felt like her family wasn't prioritizing her feelings if they'd invite Scott against her wishes.  \"You didn\u2019t have a relationship with my dad for 25 years?\u201d Kendall asked her mother.  In the end, Caitlyn was invited \u2014 although she didn't actually show up.  Kourtney later confided to Kendall that she wasn't sure she wanted to attend the party because of the drama with her sisters and because of Scott.  Advertisement  The pair ended up working it out themselves. Kevork Djansezian/Chance Yeh/Getty Images  \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get along if we\u2019re all in the same place,\u201d Kourtney told her. \u201cThe meanness and stuff, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d  But Scott ultimately was invited \u2014 and attended \u2014 after he and Kourtney were able to hash out the situation themselves.  \"I think that our lives are changing. If my boyfriend is going to the party, if you're there, I just don't want any disrespect,\" Kourtney told Scott. \"I've been feeling super anxious \u2026 but I don't want the kids to not have their dad there.\"  Ultimately, the party went off without a hitch and Kourtney and Scott both got to celebrate the holiday with their children.  Advertisement  \u201cNot sharing this whole experience with my family and my kids, it wouldn\u2019t have felt right,\u201d Kourtney later said of her decision.

        "doc_1_text": "Scott Disick has never handled his breakup with Kourtney Kardashian particularly well, but on Sunday's Keeping Up With the Kardashians, viewers got a look at just how crazy their relationship drama can get.  In an effort to get out of Los Angeles and take in some foreign culture, Kourtney decided to fly to France for the annual Cannes Film Festival, where she'd also get a chance to enjoy an idyllic getaway with her new man, Younes Bendjima.  But for Scott, the trip seemed to be more of a slap in the face, and he went a little too far with his reaction to the news that Kourtney was going on a romantic getaway.  \"We got into like, a full war,\" Kourtney revealed to her sisters, Kim and Khloe Kardashian, recounting a series of phone calls and text message conversations the former couple had recently had.  \"He was like, 'You're gonna have a great time,'\" Kourtney said, imitating Scott's sarcastic tone. \"And then he's threatening me now. He's like, 'Your little friend is gonna get beat up every single day when we're there.' He goes, 'Enjoy yourself. Walking around, you better watch your back.'\"  \"'I'm like, 'Oh, are you gonna have people attack me?'\" she continued. \"And he's like, 'You're the love of my life. Why would I have anyone attack you?... Just don't expect anywhere you go will be easy now.'\"  These threats were not something Kourtney was willing to put up with, and the 38-year-old reality star put her foot down.  \"I said, 'I will actually never speak to you again with your threats, you psychopath,'\" she shared. \"'If you threaten me and my friends, it's over. That's not how I will be treated. You've treated me horrible for years.'\"  According to Kourtney, Scott also messaged her saying, \"Anyone who gets in the middle [between us] will not be pleased with the outcome.\"  In a separate interview with the KUWTK cameras, Kim and Khloe said that Scott's behavior surprised them, even after all the drama he's stirred up in the past.  \"I just can't believe that he would stoop this low and speak to her like this,\" Khloe said. \"At the end of the day, she's still the mother of his children. So to say that he's gonna have people get beat up? That's disgusting. So I really hope he was out of his right mind\u2026 It's just so childish.\"  Scott and Kourtney share three young children -- 7-year-old son Mason, 5-year-old daughter Penelope and 2-year-old son Reign -- and while Scott has been pining for her since their split in July 2015, his reckless and demanding behavior has been a source of drama between the two for years.  After he seemingly ignored several of Khloe's phone calls, Scott did sit down for a solo interview with the show, and admitted that he went too far with his intimidating remarks.  \"You know, when Kourtney was telling me that she was going, she was kinda being a drop condescending and I think I got defensive, and just said, like, 'OK great, if you're gonna be in Cannes with another guy, have fun, but just know that it's probably not gonna be that fun if you run into me and my friends,'\" Scott shared.  \"The fact of the matter is she's allowed to live her life. She's a single girl and obviously we all know that I do what I want so she should be able to do what she wants,\" he continued. \"But there's a lot of anger. Like, wow, it's really real, us not being together.\"  Later in the episode, as Kourtney and sister Kendall Jenner were getting ready to head to France, Khloe finally got through to Scott, who admitted that he had made a mistake.  \"It's just hard, you know? I never thought I'd go through anything like this,\" he said over the phone.  Scott and Khloe, who have always been close friends, sat down together for the KUWTK cameras and Scott acknowledged that he \"was acting a bit immature.\"  \"I said a few things that weren't appropriate,\" he said. \"I'm not gonna regret that, because it was like, that's how I felt at the time. You can understand that we have a lot of history. So it's hard.\"  Ultimately, Scott did stop sending Kourtney texts threatening her boyfriend, but that didn't stop him from heading out to Cannes to party as well. The reality star made headlines and sparked romance rumors when he flew to the French vacation destination with then-19-year-old actress Bella Thorne.  However, Kim thought Scott was only spending time with Bella in an attempt to get back at Kourtney for her relationship with Younes, scoffing at the unfolding drama when Kendall called her and mom Kris Jenner from Cannes.  \"[Scott and Bella] looked so desperate at the airport, like, who goes to LAX together?\" Kim said, with Kendall on speakerphone. \"It's not a good look for Scott, at all.\"  \"He talked to me about it. He thinks it is,\" Kendall explained. \"He was like, 'I'm doing it to make Kourtney mad.\"  \"I think it's clear to everyone that Scott is doing this just to try to one-up Kourtney, and that seems super malicious,\" Kim reflected. \"Kourtney is genuinely trying to go away and have a good time and he's trying to like, freak her out and make Kourtney think that there's gonna be some crazy drama running. It's just so ridiculous.\"  While Kourtney spent time on a yacht with her boyfriend in Cannes, Scott was spotted getting friendly with a number of women other than Bella.  In the few days that he was in France, Scott was spotted spending time with 18-year-old Sofia Richie, 19-year-old British model Ella Ross and his former fling Chloe Bartoli, among others. He was also photographed kissing an unknown brunette woman.  \"It's all a jealousy thing.\" Kourtney said, before introducing Khloe and Kris to her new boyfriend for the first time.  Khloe was clearly impressed by Younes' physique, but the conversation quickly turned back to Scott's attempts get a reaction out of Kourtney.  \"To me, I feel like I'm watching a ping-pong match,\" Khloe quipped.  \"Yeah, but it's weird because I'm, like, not in the tournament,\" Kourtney replied.  Kourney didn't let Scott get to her, and she ended up having a fun time partying with her boyfriend, which she said made it one of the first times she was \"really able to have an amazing time and not be worried about what [Scott] was up to.\"  \"I'm not trying to throw anything in anyone's face,\" she said in a solo interview at the end of the episode. \"But I'm also not gonna hide.\"  For more on Scott's wild week at the Cannes Film Festival in May, check out the video below.",

And it has emerged supposed non-smoker Khloe Kardashian was holding a marijuana joint in a recent episode of her clan's television show portraying their holiday in Costa Rica.  In a typically exciting installment of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday, she was shown holding a suspicious-looking cigarette in her hand as she enthusiastically embraced her sister Kourtney's former lover Scott Disick.  No smoke without fire: Khloe Kardashian is said to have been holding a marijuana joint on Sunday's Keeping Up With The Kardashians  According to TMZ, sources close to production said they did not mind the fact the 32-year-old was holding a drug in the scene because it was a natural moment.  In addition, while marijuana is illegal in the United States, it is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica.  However it is hardly the first time the star has caused a stir due to smokling.  For back in 2014 she was photographed puffing away on a suspicious looking cigarette while in a nightclub with her then lover The Game.  However her spokesman claimed at the time: 'She doesn\u2019t smoke pot or cigarettes. It's a Hookah stick, which is tobacco free. It\u2019s called Phantom Smoke.'  Watch the joint: Khloe seemed careful as she went in for a hug with Scott Disick  Carried away: But she seemed to be relishing her clinch with sister Kourtney's former lover  No wonder it's so popular: Marijuana is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica  She was spotted smoking while on the dance floor while getting very close to rapper and self-proclaimed 'weed enthusiast,' whose real name is the rather less flamboyant Jayceon Taylor.  At one point in her exciting evening the classy broad was even seen waving her gargantuan behind at him, Miley Cyrus style.  The 37-year-old rapper recently raised by confirming he had slept with sisters Kim and Khloe, as well as their future sister-in-law Blac Chyna.  Chivalrous Jayceon told Wendy WIlliams after she quizzed him on his single Sauce, where he raps, 'I used to f*** b****s that Usher Raymond passed on, Then I f***ed three Kardashians.'  Sly puff?

Tensions run high in San Francisco  During a sisters trip in October, pregnant Khlo\u00e9, 33, majorly clashed with Kourtney, 38, for always being on her phone \u2014 and showing up late.  \u201cWhat the f\u2014 are you here for?\u201d she snapped at one point. \u201cDon\u2019t chime in if you\u2019re not going to get off your f\u2014ing phone call all the time. You\u2019re like, a waste of space in my meter right now. You\u2019re annoying as f\u2014 now when we\u2019re together. This is what you do. You\u2019re on your phone the whole time. You\u2019re just not present!\u201d  Kourtney tried to defend her \u201c10-minute conversation,\u201d but Khlo\u00e9 wasn\u2019t having it.  \u201cWe\u2019re only here once,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen are we ever going to go back to Alcatraz? You know what? Actually, I\u2019m not doing this today. I\u2019m not doing this today, because last time in Costa Rica, I looked crazy because I\u2019m always the one complaining to get you guys to have fun. I\u2019m not going to be crazy, okay? You\u2019ll be the f\u2014ing bitch that you need to be.\u201d  \u201cGood. F\u2014 you, you f\u2014ing whore,\u201d Kourtney retorted, adding, \u201cPregnant whore!\u201d  But at the end of the day, they\u2019re still family, and Khlo\u00e9 made a point to thank Kourtney and Kim, 37, for the memories they made on the trip.  \u201cI wanted to say thank you guys so much for the San Fran trip,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we had our ups and our downs, I feel like still always have fun. What is life without a little feuding with sisters?\u201d  Khlo\u00e9 learns her baby\u2019s sex  Another huge moment from the San Francisco trip was Khlo\u00e9 finding out her and Tristan Thompson\u2018s baby\u2019s gender. After her doctor got the genetics results, she texted the information to Kylie Jenner, who had asked to be the one to relay the news to Khlo\u00e9 personally.  \u201cI have such anxiety, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9 while waiting for Kylie\u2019s phone call.  \u201cWhatever is meant to be \u2014 even if it\u2019s it\u2019s a girl, just know that\u2019s what your path is, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d reassured Kim.  \u201cOf course, and I want a girl eventually,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI just want older brothers to like \u2026 we\u2019ve never had older brothers.\u201d  But even though Khlo\u00e9 was \u201cconvinced\u201d she was having a boy, she found out she\u2019s actually having a girl \u2014 and her initial reaction was pure disappointment.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having a girl,\u201d she said, looking upset.  \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Kim. \u201cI cried when I found North was going to be a girl, too.\u201d  \u201cWhen you have your mind made up as to what you\u2019re having \u2026 and then when you find out it\u2019s the complete opposite, it\u2019s just a shock,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m like, in a state of shock.\u201d  Khlo\u00e9 then called mom Kris Jenner to share the news, confessing she had been hoping Kylie was lying.  \u201cThat is so amazing,\u201d said Kris, 62. \u201cKhlo\u00e9, the only thing I wanted in life was a boy. Three times. And I got the three of you. But a man is much more attached to a girl. This will be the love of [Tristan\u2019s] life \u2014 no offense to you.\u201d  \u201cWell, then I\u2019m going to get jealous,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cThen I don\u2019t like that \u2014 I don\u2019t like her.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t be a bitch,\u201d chided Kris.  Of course, Khlo\u00e9 eventually warmed up to the news \u2014 especially once she got to witness Tristan\u2019s adorable reaction.  \u201cHe\u2019ll be like, \u2018How\u2019s my princess doing? I just want to check on my two girls,\u2019 \u201d explained Khlo\u00e9. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute about everything. I still feel so bad [about] how I felt [when I found out], but that\u2019s just how I felt. I am getting more excited.\u201d  \u201cI was looking at nurseries for boys and I just think you need like a day or two to let it sink in, and then you get over it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd honestly, girls stuff is so much cuter anyway, and it\u2019ll be so cute to have a little girl in the stands rooting for her dad.\u201d  \u201cI am honestly so excited Khlo\u00e9 is having a girl,\u201d gushed Kim. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting me and Khlo\u00e9 things for our girls, and it\u2019s probably going to be so annoying but they\u2019re all going to have the same things, do the same things, be in the same class.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s so cute,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cSee, that makes me excited! \u2026 My life will never be the same in the best way. I\u2019ve kind of been waiting for this for so long, and now it\u2019s finally happening. I\u2019m so excited to see what the next six months are going to bring.\u201d  Kim shares her surrogacy journey  Meanwhile, Kim was going through her own unique journey to motherhood: She and Kanye West were expecting their third child via surrogate. (They welcomed daughter Chicago on Jan. 15.)  \u201cIt\u2019s been such a crazy year,\u201d she reflected. \u201cOur surrogate has been amazing, but it has been challenging with all of the media leaks. \u2026 And it just feels weird that my family has no idea what my experience has been like.\u201d  Kim decided to bring her surrogate, La\u2019Reina, over to Kris\u2019 house to introduce her to her mom and sisters. Though the KUWTK cameras avoided capturing La\u2019Reina\u2019s face, they showed a sweet moment where she bonded with pregnant Kylie, 20, and Khlo\u00e9. (The three women were just months apart in their pregnancies.) The scene also marked the first time all season that Kylie\u2019s baby bump was clearly visible.  After Khlo\u00e9 asked whether being a surrogate was challenging \u201cemotionally,\u201d La\u2019Reina explained that she doesn\u2019t look at it that way.  \u201cBecause I know from the very beginning this is not my baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end, my joy and my satisfaction is with whoever I\u2019m having the baby for. \u2026 I know what my job is in all of it. It makes me feel important because I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, I did something so good. This is beautiful. I would do this again a thousand more times.\u2019 \u201d  \u201cThis is so beautiful,\u201d gushed Kylie. \u201cThis is so amazing. You should be [proud] \u2014 it\u2019s so special.\u201d  \u201cWithout you, this wouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201d added Kris. \u201cSo we can\u2019t say thank you enough.\u201d  But no one was more grateful than Kim.  \u201cThis experience, going into it, I really didn\u2019t know what to expect because I don\u2019t really know anyone that\u2019s gone through this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely not as easy as I thought it would be, emotionally, but it\u2019s so worth it and our surrogate is such a nice person. My family absolutely loves her and I\u2019m just so grateful.\u201d  \u201cSurrogacy is such a beautiful thing and we\u2019re just so excited to welcome our baby girl,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re all doing this together. My family and my kids mean everything to me.\u201d",

Younes Bendjima and Scott Disick reportedly met at the Kardashian Christmas Party & let\u2019s just say, they prob won\u2019t sit next to each other at XMas dinner.  Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s ex and current boyfriend finally came face-to-face at Kris Jenner\u2018s annual Christmas Eve party and according to sources, it was NOT all merry and bright! Younes Bendjima, 24, attended his first ever Kardashian Christmas party with Kourt, 38, and was inevitably introduced to his GF\u2019s baby-daddy and ex, Scott Disick. A source close to the Kardashian gamily told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, \u201cScott was under strict orders to be on his best behavior at the party, and to not cause any trouble with Younes\u2014and he managed to walk the line, just. There was a definite tension in the air when Kourtney introduced them to each other, but Scott and Younes shook hands and exchanged some pretty awkward pleasantries, and that was that.\u201d Sounds civil, but there\u2019s no way Scott was pleased when Kourtney started planting kisses on Younes in the infamous Kardashian photobooth and documenting them on her Snap!  The insider added, \u201cEverybody thinks Scott still loves Kourtney, but he\u2019s no good for her and she\u2019s moved on\u2014and there\u2019s no doubting that Scott isn\u2019t happy about it. Regardless of how badly he\u2019s treated her in the past, Scott always had this fantasy in his head that he could click his fingers and Kourtney would come running.\u201d However, they said there\u2019s no chance Kourtney is coming back to Scott while things are going so well with Younes. \u201cYounes makes Kourtney happier than she ever was with Scott, there\u2019s no game playing or drama, and he truly loves and respects her. Scott certainly isn\u2019t happy about it, but he better get used to Younes being around, because he isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d That was definitely clear at last night\u2019s party! Even if Scott does want Kourt back, he\u2019s still hot and heavy with his much-younger girlfriend, Sofia Richie, 19, but she was forced to stay home, as she didn\u2019t make Kris Jenner\u2019s guest list!  HollywoodLife.com heard from an industry insider that said Kourtney was \u201cruining his holidays with her jealous, petty ban of Sofia,\u201d but that she has several issues with Scott dating Sofia and does not like it at all.\u201d While Kourtney won\u2019t allow Scott to introduce their three children to Sofia, Younes has already met them and Scott was furious. Hopefully this trio can keep it together for the holidays!  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Scott & Younes meeting? Let us know!",

Kim and Kourtney reportedly demanded that the other children at a Color Me Mine store not attend the pottery workshop so North and Penelope could have it all to themselves.  A source tells the Enquirer, \u201cKim and Kourtney left lotsa tots crying their eyes out. Passersby kept stopping to ask miffed moms what the ruckus was, and one angry lady groused, \u2018Those darn Kardashians had the place shut down, so now we\u2019re left out in the cold while our kids have a damn meltdown!\u2019\u201d  Although Kim\u2019s and Kourtney\u2019s reps have already shut down the report, we\u2019ve heard stories like this about the Kardashians before. We\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re entitled and behave as such, not making room for other people they deem to be \u2018beneath\u2019 them. Since they consider themselves on the level of Beyonce, they probably didn\u2019t want their children to associate with the \u2018plebeians\u2019. However, they\u2019ll soon find out what it\u2019s like to be plebeians themselves, especially if their show continues deteriorating in ratings the way it has the last few weeks.  Eventually, they won\u2019t be able to demand separate spaces for themselves or their children, because no one will listen to their requests. The store owner who agreed to kick out the other children might have been all aflutter from being in the presence of \u2018celebrities\u2019, but that will no longer be an asset for the Kardashians once their fame drifts away.  Of course, there\u2019s also the chance that this report is pure \u2018fake news\u2019, driven by anti-Kardashian sentiment. Knowing that their ratings are crashing and that nobody cares about them anymore should really force the family to be more humble, especially Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian (being that they have children and all). However, it might be doing the exact opposite\u2026 but hey, desperation makes people do crazy things sometimes.  What do you guys think?

        "generated_text": "Despite the recent decline in ratings for \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" Kim and Kourtney Kardashian have reportedly demanded special treatment for their children. According to a source, the reality TV stars made arrangements for North and Penelope to have a private pottery workshop at a Color Me Mine store, leaving other children in tears. The move has been met with anger from other parents, who feel left out and frustrated by the Kardashians' perceived sense of entitlement.\n\nWhile Kim and Kourtney's reps have denied the report, similar stories have been told about the Kardashian family in the past. The family has been accused of behaving as if they are entitled and out of touch, refusing to associate with those they perceive as beneath them. However, with their show's declining ratings, the Kardashians may soon find themselves in a position where they have to make do with what they have, without the luxury of separate spaces or special treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is expecting a baby girl with Tristan Thompson. While Kylie Jenner delivered the news to Khloe over the phone, Khloe was initially disappointed and in a state of shock, as she had her mind made up that she was having a boy. Khloe later explained her reaction to Kris Jenner, saying, \"When you have your mind made up as to what you're having, like everyone told me you're going to feel what you're feeling and you'll just kind of know. And then when you find out it's the complete opposite it's just a shock.\"\n\nWhile Khloe and Kris share a close bond, Kris has joked that she is hoping Kylie will say that she is lying and that Khloe is actually having a boy. As a mother, Kris understands the disappointment that can come with not getting the gender of one's child right, having gone through three sons before having Khloe. However, she also believes that a boy is often a father's favorite, adding, \"a man is much more attached to a boy.\"\n\nOverall, it seems that the Kardashian family is facing some tough times, both in terms of their show's declining ratings and their perceived sense of entitlement. However, they have always been known for their ability to bounce back and stay relevant in the public eye, so it will be interesting to see how they fare in the coming months and years.",

Add in the fact that middle-sister Khloe is also pregnant and expecting her first child in early April, according to her Twitter, and the Kardashian clan couldn\u2019t be happier. Still, you\u2019ve heard the saying \u2018when it rains it pours.\u2019 Sure enough, ENews\u2019 sneak peeks of the newest episode airing this Sunday, February 25 show Kourtney dishing to her sisters about a potential little cousin for brand new babies, Chicago and Stormi. So, straight up: Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Is she really going to freeze her eggs?  While there are no confirmations at this point that Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant, Kourtney\u2019s own words suggest she\u2019s got baby number four on her mind. And we know KUWTK crews film episodes several weeks to months before they air. Spoiler videos for this Sunday\u2019s episode, \u201cTrimester Trouble,\u201d reveal Kourtney\u2019s plan to freeze her eggs as \u201cinsurance,\u201d that she can have a fourth child in the future. So will we know at the end of this episode if Kourtney's going to freeze her eggs?  Kourtney also revealed that she uses an IUD as birth control with her current boyfriend, model, Younes Bendjima, 24. Adding, however, that she wouldn\u2019t mind taking it out if her partner wanted children in the near term. It seems that the Kardashian women are on a pregnancy roll. But what about the boys, or should we say, Kardashian Kastoffs?  Kardashian Exes Talk Babies and New Boyfriends  Khloe\u2019s ex-husband, Lamar Odom discloses in a not-yet-aired interview with Access Hollywood, that he\u2019s happy for Khloe about her pregnancy with new boyfriend, Cavaliers player, Tristan Thompson. Lamar can be heard saying that, \u201cit couldn\u2019t happen to a better person,\u201d US Magazine reports. Still, he admits hearing the bombshell Khloe divulged in the season 13 finale, that she was only \u201cfake trying\u201d to get pregnant while she was married to him, was \u201churtful.\u201d  Similarly, Kylie\u2019s famous on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend, Tyga had good things to say about Kylie and her new baby. He told radio interviewer, DJ Akademiks that, \u201cthere\u2019s no bad blood, no problems.\u201d And while the 28-year-old rapper didn\u2019t comment on Stormi specifically during this interview, he did admit that he and Kylie still \u201ccommunicate.\" And that did nothing to squash internet rumors that Tyga may be the biological father of the 20-year-old cosmetics mogul\u2019s new daughter.  And what about Kourtney\u2019s ex and baby-daddy, Scott Disick? The man who got Kourtney Kardashian pregnant three times in the past is plenty busy hitting the town with new girlfriend, 19-year-old Sophia Richie, younger daughter of Lionel Richie. And on the Rob Kardashian front, there\u2019s not much news yet. Momager Kris\u2019s only son, Rob, has not found love again. At least not after his much-publicized breakup with Blac Chyna, the mother of one-year-old Dream Kardashian. But with all these new babies on the scene, who has time to date?",

After Eminem tore into Donald Trump with a savage freestyle rap, HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE scoop on whether or not he\u2019ll \u2018pull a Kanye\u2019 and run for office!  In a world where a real estate mogul/former reality television star can be elected to the highest office in the land, the idea of Eminem, 44, launching a presidential bid isn\u2019t that farfetched. Some fans were hoping Em (born Marshall Mathers) would declare his candidacy after he lyrically demolished President Donald Trump, 71, at the start of the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards. \u201cEminem is very happy that his take down of Trump is getting so much attention,\u201d a source close to the rapper EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe feels that he has to use his gift for good and dropping the rap is his way to get his message out there.\u201d  \u201cAs for taking it to the political stage and to run for office in any way? Not a chance in the world,\u201d the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, crushing the hopes of anyone wanting an Eminem 2020 campaign sticker. \u201cMarshall is not going to pull a Kanye [West] and announce his candidacy. The nonsense and the baggage that comes with politics, especially running for President would be outrageous.\u201d While Eminem is no stranger to being \u201coutrageous\u201d and causing a controversy or two (especially about Donald Trump), seems politics are just not his jam.  After all, why dive into the political world when he could set the rap world on fire? Slim\u2019s freestyle, which he called \u201cThe Storm\u201d on Twitter (per CNN) saw him spit such red-hot lines like, \u201cSame sh*t that he tormented Hillary [Clinton] for and he slandered and does it some more. From his endorsement of [Steve] Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that\u2019s black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.\u201d Damn.  \u201cEminem is a success at music and he wants to use his music for good. And it obviously shows that it is working with this recent attack on Trump,\u201d the insider added. \u201cHe wants to provoke change in the way he knows how, and that is through his music.\u201d So, that takes care of that. If music fans want to see a hip-hop influenced dude from Detroit run for officer, there\u2019s always that rumored Kid Rock, 46, senate run. That\u2019s\u2026something, right?  Do you think Eminem should reconsider and run for office, HollywoodLifers?",

MediaTakeOut states\u2026  The tabloid MedaTakeOut is to its old ways again! It has titled a recently published story about Tran and Milian as:  \u201cChristina Milian And Her BEST FRIEND Karrueche Are Spotted FROLICKING On The Beach\u2026 Do Y\u2019all Think\u2026 These Two Are \u2018MORE THAN FRIENDS\u2019???\u201d  It writes in the story:  \u201cKarrueche Tran and Christina Milian have been close \u2018friends\u2019 now for many years. But there\u2019s something about the way these two act \u2013 it makes us think that there\u2019s MORE going on than meets the eye.\u201d  The webloid states that they were at a gala together followed by going to the beach in Florida. They write:  \u201cThe two have been partying in Miami all week,\u201d  They support it with pictures of the two in the ocean and on the sand.  Gossip Cop found out\u2026.  Gossip Cop has found out that this story is just made sensational and misleading. Facts have been twisted. Gossip Cop got the information that actress Karrueche Tran and singer-songwriter Christina Milian were in Miami for a friend\u2019s birthday.  The tabloid deliberately cropped the pictures in such a way that it appeared that the two were alone on the beach. Even if they had decided to hit the beach alone, it by no means implies that they are \u2018more than friends\u2019.  Gossip Cop spoke to Tran\u2019s representative. The rep said:  \u201cIt\u2019s B.S..\u201d  It has been learned that the same outlet had stated in December 2016 that Christina Milian was pregnant. Before that, the same tabloid in September 2016 had falsely claimed that Tran was pregnant with Chris Brown\u2019s baby.  It is amusing that the outlet has not mentioned those babies here in this story. The MediaTakeOut has been spreading false rumors about the two friends and taking their platonic friendship in the wrong way.  Gossip Cop has found out that this is not the first time that the webloid has given a different meaning to a pure friendship between two female friends.  In March 2017, they had claimed that model and actress Amber Rose and singer Teyana Taylor were getting involved romantically. They had based their claim on a video that showed the two having a party at a strip club.  You may like to read Look what Christina Milian has done on her baby bump as she gears to deliver her second baby!  Tran-Milian long-dated friendship  It might be recalled that Tran and Milian were sighted at Miami Beach on 11th July 2017. They were flaunting their gym-toned bodies in their bikinis. Christina Milian had on a shimmering two-piece pink bikini.  Her best friend Karrueche had donned a green printed bikini. They relished burgers after their swim and walked on the sandy beach. They had also attended a gala the night before.  Christina Milian and Karrueche Tran have been friends now for many years. They are spotted often at lunch or dinner or during vacations together.  They even attend awards functions and the like together, whenever possible. They are the best of pals and do stand for each other at times of trouble.  Christina Milian had helped and stood by Karrueche Tran during her split from her boyfriend Chris Brown over cheating allegations. Chris Brown had fathered a daughter with Nia Guzman.  Tran at that time had tweeted:  \u201cListen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family.\u201d  In March 2016, when Chris had called Tran \u2018vulnerable\u2019, \u2018barely famous\u2019,  and \u2018emotionally distraught\u2019, Tran had hit back:  \u201cCAN ALL THIS PETTY S*** STOP. IT IS SO UNNECESSARY. You have a beautiful daughter and so much to live for. LIVE YOUR LIFE and be positive. I am so over the drama!\u201d  Milian was right beside Tran during this time also to provide her with the much-needed support. The two have stuck to each other through thick and thin.  Their Instagram posts and pictures and the paparazzi snaps are all witnesses to the great and lasting friendship of these two girls.  Milian has always gushed about Tran. She had said:  \u201cShe\u2019s a really good friend of mine, and I love her,\u201d  Also read Christina Milian and Matthieu Pokora welcome their son. Who is Matthieu Pokora?  Short bio on Christina Milian  Christina Milian is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is best known for her lead role in the 2003 teen comedy film Love Don\u2019t Cost a Thing. She is also popular for her second studio album, It\u2019s About Time. She was named #30 on the Maxim magazine Hot 100 of 2005 list. More bio\u2026  Share this",
        "generated_text": "Christina Milian and Karrueche Tran, two long-time friends, have recently been the subject of sensational rumors that they are more than just friends. MediaTakeOut published a story claiming that the two were spotted frolicking on the beach and partying in Miami, implying that they have a romantic relationship. However, Gossip Cop has exclusively learned that these rumors are completely false and that the two women were simply spending time with a friend to celebrate a birthday.\n\nThe story begins with MediaTakeOut claiming that Milian and Tran have been \"close 'friends' now for many years,\" but their behavior makes them seem like more than friends. The outlet then goes on to claim that the two were seen at a gala and on the beach, and that they have been partying in Miami all week. To support their claim, MediaTakeOut includes pictures of the two in the ocean and on the sand.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has found that this story is completely false. We spoke to Tran's representative, who exclusively told us that this story is \"B.S.\" In fact, Milian and Tran were in Miami for a friend's birthday, and the pictures that MediaTakeOut included were deliberately cropped to make it seem like they were alone on the beach. Even if they had decided to hit the beach alone, it does not mean that they are in a romantic relationship.\n\nMediaTakeOut is not the first outlet to spread false rumors about these two friends. In fact, the same outlet falsely claimed in December 2016 that Milian was pregnant, and in September 2016, it falsely claimed that Tran was pregnant with Chris Brown's baby. It is amusing that MediaTakeOut did not mention those babies in this story.\n\nDespite the false rumors, Milian and Tran have always been close friends. They have been spotted vacationing together and attending events together, and Milian has always gushed about Tran. In fact, Milian has stated that Tran is a \"really good friend of mine, and I love her.\"\n\nIn conclusion, MediaTakeOut has once again spread false rumors about Christina Milian and Karrueche Tran. While it is true that the two women have been friends for many years, there is no evidence to suggest that they are in a romantic relationship. We hope that MediaTakeOut will stop spreading these false rumors and focus on reporting accurate and factual news.",

The Titanic star's name has recently been dragged by a magazine and claimed the 43-year-old star is becoming anti-social day by day.  Also read: Spielberg trailer: Leonardo DiCaprio, Liam Neeson and more pay respect to the great film maker in HBO's new documentary  An insider told the magazine that the actor is becoming antisocial these days because he has \"developed major trust issues\" and is \"totally paranoid.\"  The magazine further claimed that DiCaprio, whose name has been involved with various supermodels and even with his Titanic co-star Kate Winslet lately, is no more interested in love life as well.  \"He used to be the life of the party. Now he won't let any woman near him,\" the source further claimed.  Gossip Cop looked over the matter and busted the website for making up false news about the Inception actor as some of the actors' close pals called the magazine's report as 'nonsense.'  Given that, the actor was recently spotted attending Drake's birthday party in Los Angeles with his pals Jamie Foxx and Tobey Maguire.  Besides that, last week he was also joined by Robert Pattinson and The Weeknd for his own birthday party at The Highlight Room in LA. A few weeks ago, he was spotted hanging out with a bunch of friends in New York City as well.  Thus, it is clear that the star is neither antisocial nor developing major trust issues.
